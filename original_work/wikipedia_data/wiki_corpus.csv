Founded in 1955 by Dan Wolf, Ed Fancher, [[John Wilcock , and [[Norman Mailer , the ''Voice'' began as a platform for the creative community of [[New York City .  It still is kept alive online.  Over its 63 years of publication, ''The Village Voice'' received three [[Pulitzer Prize s, the [[National Press Foundation  Award, and the [[George Polk Award . ''The Village Voice'' hosted a variety of writers and artists, including writer [[Ezra Pound , cartoonist [[Lynda Barry , and art critics [[Robert Christgau , [[Andrew Sarris , and [[J. Hoberman .  In October 2015, ''The Village Voice'' changed ownership and severed all ties with former parent company Voice Media Group  VMG . The ''Voice'' announced on August 22, 2017, that it would cease publication of its print edition and convert to a fully digital venture, on a date to be announced.<ref name=""jleland"">[[John Leland   journalist |John Leland  and Sarah Maslin Nir, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/nyregion/village-voice-to-end-print-publication.html?mcubz=1 ""After 62 Years and Many Battles, Village Voice Will End Print Publication,""]  ''[[New York Times '', August 22, 2017.</ref> The final printed edition, featuring a 1965 photo of [[Bob Dylan  on the cover, was distributed on September 21, 2017.<ref name=""guardian-21sep2017""></ref>   After halting print publication in 2017, the ''Voice'' provided daily coverage through its website until August 31, 2018, when it announced it was ceasing production of new editorial content.<ref name=""Pager""></ref>  ==History==  ===Early history=== [[File:1955 October cover The Village Voice.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|Cover of the October 1955 issue  The ''Village Voice'' was launched by Ed Fancher, Dan Wolf, and [[Norman Mailer <ref name=nyt-wolf-obit>Lawrence van Gelder, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4DF1E39F931A25757C0A960958260 Dan Wolf, 80, a Village Voice Founder, Dies] , ''[[The New York Times '', April 12, 1996. Accessed online June 2, 2008.</ref> on October 26, 1955, from a two-bedroom apartment in [[Greenwich Village ; that was its initial coverage area, which expanded to other parts of the city by the 1960s. In 1960, it moved from 22 Greenwich Avenue to 61 [[Christopher Street  in a landmark triangular corner building adjoining Sheridan Square, and a few feet west of the [[Stonewall Inn ; then, from the 1970s through 1980, at 11th Street and University Place; and then Broadway and 13th Street. It moved to [[Cooper Square  Manhattan |Cooper Square  in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village  in 1991, and in 2013, to the [[Financial District  Manhattan |Financial District .  Early columnists of the 1950s and 1960s included [[Jonas Mekas , who explored the underground film movement in his ""Film Journal"" column; [[Linda Solomon , who reviewed the Village club scene in the ""Riffs"" column; and [[Sam Julty , who wrote a popular column on car ownership and maintenance. John Wilcock wrote a column every week for the paper's first ten years. Another regular from that period was the cartoonist [[Kin Platt , who did weekly theatrical caricatures. Other prominent regulars have included [[Peter Schjeldahl , [[Ellen Willis , [[Jill Johnston , Tom Carson, and [[Richard Goldstein  writer born 1944 |Richard Goldstein .  For more than 40 years, [[Wayne Barrett  was the newspaper's [[muckraker , covering New York [[Real estate development|real estate developers  and politicians, including [[Donald Trump . The material has become a valuable resource for reporters covering the president today.<ref name=""Pager"" />  The ''Voice'' has published investigations of New York City politics, as well as reporting on national politics, with arts, culture, music, dance, film, and theater reviews. Writers for the ''Voice'' have received three [[Pulitzer Prize s: in 1981  [[Teresa Carpenter  , 1986  [[Jules Feiffer   and 2000  [[Mark Schoofs  . The paper has, almost since its inception, recognized alternative theater in New York through its [[Obie Awards . The paper's ""[[Pazz & Jop "" music poll, started by [[Robert Christgau  in the early 1970s, is released annually and remains an influential survey of the nation's music critics. In 1999, film critic [[J. Hoberman  and film section editor Dennis Lim began a similar [[Village Voice Film Poll  for the year in film. In 2001, the ''Voice'' sponsored its first music festival, Siren Festival, a free annual event every summer held at [[Coney Island . The event moved to the lower tip of Manhattan in 2011, and was re-christened the ""[[4knots  Music Festival"", a reference to the speed of the East River's current.  The ''Voice'' was known for its staunch support for [[gay rights , and it published an annual [[Gay Pride  issue every June. However, early in its history, the newspaper had a reputation as having a [[homophobia|homophobic  slant. While reporting on the [[Stonewall riots  of 1969, the newspaper referred to the riots as ""The Great Faggot Rebellion"". Two reporters, Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott IV, both used the words ""[[faggot  slang |faggot "" and ""[[dyke  slang |dyke "" in their articles about the riots.  These words were not commonly used by homosexuals to refer to each other at this time.  Smith and Truscott retrieved their press cards from the ''Voice'' offices, which were very close to the bar, as the trouble began; they were among the first journalists to record the event, Smith being trapped inside the bar with the police, and Truscott reporting from the street. After the riot, the [[Gay Liberation Front   GLF  attempted to promote dances for gays and lesbians in the ''Voice'', but were not allowed to use the words ""gay"" or ""homosexual"", which the newspaper considered derogatory. The newspaper changed its policy after the GLF petitioned it to do so. Over time, the ''Voice'' changed its stance, and, in 1982, became the second organization in the US known to have extended [[domestic partner  benefits. Jeff Weinstein, an employee of the paper and shop steward for the publishing local of District 65 UAW, negotiated and won agreement in the union contract to extend health, life insurance, and disability benefits to the ""spouse equivalents"" of its union members.  The ''Voice''s competitors in New York City include ''[[New York Observer '' and ''[[Time Out  magazine |Time Out New York ''. Seventeen alternative weeklies around the United States are owned by the ''Voice's'' former parent company [[Village Voice Media . The film section writers and editors also produced a weekly Voice Film Club podcast.     In 1996, after decades of carrying a cover price, the ''Voice'' switched from a paid [[weekly newspaper|weekly  to a free, [[alternative newspaper|alternative  weekly. The ''Voice'' website was a recipient of the [[National Press Foundation ’s Online Journalism Award in 2001 and the ''[[Editor & Publisher '' EPpy Award for Best Overall U.S. Newspaper Online Service – Weekly, Community, Alternative & Free in 2003.  In 2005, the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix  alternative weekly chain [[New Times Media  purchased the company and took the Village Voice Media name. Previous owners of ''The Village Voice'' or of Village Voice Media have included co-founders Fancher and Wolf,<ref name=nyt-wolf-obit/> New York City Councilman [[Carter Burden ,<ref name=nyt-wolf-obit/> ''New York Magazine'' founder [[Clay Felker , [[Rupert Murdoch , and [[Leonard N. Stern|Leonard Stern  of the [[Hartz Mountain Industries|Hartz Mountain  empire.  ===Acquisition by New Times Media===  After ''The Village Voice'' was acquired by [[New Times Media  in 2005, the publication's key personnel changed. The ''Voice'' was then managed by two journalists from [[Phoenix, Arizona .  In April 2006, the ''Voice'' dismissed music editor [[Chuck Eddy . Four months later, the newspaper sacked longtime music critic [[Robert Christgau . In January 2007, the newspaper fired sex columnist and erotica author [[Rachel Kramer Bussel ; long-term creative director [[Ted Keller , art director Minh Oung, fashion columnist Lynn Yeager and Deputy Art Director [[LD Beghtol  were laid off or fired soon after. [[Editor in chief  [[Donald Forst  resigned in December 2005. Doug Simmons, his replacement, was sacked in March 2006 after it was discovered that a reporter had fabricated portions of an article. Simmons' successor, [[Erik Wemple , resigned after two weeks. His replacement, [[David Blum , was fired in March 2007. [[Tony Ortega  journalist |Tony Ortega  then held the position of editor in chief from 2007 to 2012.  The sacking of [[Nat Hentoff , who worked for the paper from 1958 to 2008, led to further criticism of the management by some of its current writers, Hentoff himself, and by the ''Voice''s ideological rival paper ''[[National Review '', which referred to Hentoff as a ""treasure"".<ref name=lay>""[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/business/media/31voice.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss Village Voice Lays Off Nat Hentoff and 2 Others] "". ''The New York Times'',  December 30, 2008.</ref> At the end of 2011, Wayne Barrett, who had written for the paper since 1973, was laid off. Fellow muckraking investigative reporter Tom Robbins then resigned in solidarity.  ===Voice Media Group=== Village Voice Media executives Scott Tobias, Christine Brennan and Jeff Mars bought Village Voice Media's papers and associated web properties from its founders in September 2012, and formed the Denver-based [[Voice Media Group .  In May 2013, ''The Village Voice'' editor Will Bourne and deputy editor Jessica Lustig told ''[[The New York Times '' that they were quitting the paper rather than executing further staff layoffs. Both had been recent appointments. By then, the ''Voice'' had employed five editors since 2005. Following Bourne's and Lustig's departure, Village Media Group management fired three of the ''Voice''s longest-serving contributors: gossip and nightlife columnist [[Michael Musto , restaurant critic [[Robert Sietsema , and theater critic Michael Feingold, all of whom had been writing for the paper for decades. Feingold was rehired as a writer for ''The Village Voice'' in January 2016.  In July 2013, Voice Media Group executives named Tom Finkel as editor.  ===Peter Barbey ownership and construction=== [[Peter Barbey , through the privately owned investment company Black Walnut Holdings LLC, purchased ''The Village Voice'' from Voice Media Group in October 2015. Barbey is a member of one of America's wealthiest families. The family has had ownership interest in the ''[[Reading Eagle '', a daily newspaper serving the city of Reading, Pennsylvania and the surrounding region, for many years. Barbey serves as president and CEO of the Reading Eagle Company, and holds the same roles at ''The Village Voice''. After taking over ownership of the ''Voice'', Barbey named Joe Levy, formerly of ''[[Rolling Stone '', as interim editor in chief, and Suzan Gursoy, formerly of ''[[Ad Week '', as publisher. In December 2016, Barbey named Stephen Mooallem, formerly of ''[[Harper's Bazaar '', as editor in chief. Mooallem resigned in May 2018, and was not replaced before the publication's shutdown.<ref name=""Pager"" />  Under the Barbey ownership, advertisements for [[Escort agency|escort agencies  and [[phone sex  services came to an end.<ref name=""Pager"" />  On August 31, 2018, it was announced that the ''Village Voice'' would cease production and lay off half of its staff. The remaining staff would be kept on for a limited period for archival projects. The last news article published was an August 31 piece by freelancer Steven Wishnia about tenants returning to their building after safety concerns had prompted its evacuation.<ref name=""Pager""/> Two weeks after the ''Village Voice'' ceased operations on September 13, co-founder John Wilcock died in California at the age of 91.  ==Contributors== The ''Voice'' has published columns and works by writers such as [[Ezra Pound , [[Henry Miller , [[Barbara Garson , [[Katherine Anne Porter , staff writer and author M.S. Cone, [[James Baldwin  writer |James Baldwin , [[E.E. Cummings , staff writer and author [[Ted Hoagland , William Bastone of [[thesmokinggun.com , [[Colson Whitehead , Nelson George, Greg Tate, Barry Cooper, Peter Noel, [[Tom Stoppard , [[Lorraine Hansberry , [[Lester Bangs , Catholic activist and author Thomas E. Byers, [[Allen Ginsberg  and [[Joshua Clover . Former editors have included [[Clay Felker  and Tom Morgan.  The newspaper has also been a host to underground cartoonists. In addition to mainstay [[Jules Feiffer , whose cartoon ran for decades in the paper until its cancellation in 1996, well-known cartoonists featured in the paper have included [[Robert Crumb|R. Crumb , [[Matt Groening , [[Lynda Barry , [[Stan Mack , [[Mark Alan Stamaty , [[Ted Rall , [[Tom Tomorrow , [[Ward Sutton , [[Ruben Bolling  and [[M. Wartella .  == Backpage sex trafficking ==  As The Village Voice itself stated: ""Backpage.com was previously owned by VVM"".   According to the NYT, $22 million annually on Backpage came from prostitution and the sale of mostly under age girls to its customers. Apparently it had a corner on the market share of similar web pages that included under age human sex trafficking at approximately 70%.  Backpage paid the Village Voice to advertise these services and for a dozen years brought in 1/7th of the revenue of the VV   After repeated calls for a boycott of the Village Voice, the company was sold to Voice Media Group.  Although the Village Voice announced in August 2018 that that they would cease publication, their website, as well as their Twitter and Facebook accounts, are still active and running in 2019.  ==See also== * [[Gear  Village Voice |Gear  * [[Media of New York City   ==References==   ==Further reading==  * Carson, Tom.

From October 2015 to May 2016, the ''Washington Free Beacon'' hired [[Fusion GPS  to conduct opposition research on ""multiple candidates"" during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election , including Donald Trump. The ''Free Beacon'' stopped funding this research when Donald Trump had clinched the Republican nomination. Fusion GPS would later hire former British intelligence officer [[Christopher Steele  and produce [[Trump–Russia dossier|a dossier  alleging links between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. [[Paul Singer  businessman |Paul Singer , a billionaire and hedge fund manager, who is a major donor to the ''Free Beacon'', said he was unaware of this dossier until it was published by ''[[BuzzFeed '' in January 2017.<ref name=""NYT_2017_steeledossier""></ref> On October 27, 2017, the ''Free Beacon'' publicly disclosed that it had hired Fusion GPS, and stated that it ""had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele.""<ref name=Washington_Free_Beacon></ref>  The ''Free Beacon'' came under criticism for its reporting on Fusion GPS.

[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic 's [[Conor Friedersdorf  called the <i>Free Beacon</i>'s mission ""decadent and unethical"".<ref name=""Atlantic""></ref>  Ben Howe wrote in ''[[The Daily Beast '' that the Washington Free Beacon established ""itself as a credible source of conservative journalism with deep investigative dives and exposes on money in politics,"" but that after Trump's election ""shifted away from the template they were establishing and more towards the path of least resistance: spending their time criticizing the left and the media, along with healthy doses of opinion writing."" McKay Coppins in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review '' writes of the Free Beacon that while the website contains ""a fair amount of trolling... it has also earned a reputation for real-deal journalism...If a partisan press really is the future, we could do worse than the ''Free Beacon''.""  Jeet Heer writes in ''[[The New Republic '' of the Free Beacon, ""Unlike other comparable conservative websites, the Free Beacon makes an effort to do original reporting.

In 2015, ''[[Mother Jones  magazine |Mother Jones '' wrote positively of the Free Beacon, noting that it is far better than contemporary conservative outlets such as ''The Daily Caller''.<ref name="":1""></ref> ''Mother Jones'' however noted that ""the ''Beacon'' hasn’t always steered clear of stories that please the base but don’t really stand up,"" and that it pieces inflammatory pieces that ""push conservatives’ buttons"".<ref name="":1"" /> That same year, the ''[[Washingtonian  magazine |Washingtonian '' wrote that ""The Beacon’s emphasis on newsgathering sets it apart among right-facing publications"".  ==See also== * [[Alternative media  U.S. political right    ==References==   ==External links== *    [[Category:American political websites  [[Category:News aggregators  [[Category:American conservative websites  [[Category:American political blogs  [[Category:Conservatism in the United States  [[Category:Criticism of journalism  [[Category:American news websites  [[Category:Political organizations in the United States  [[Category:American journalism organizations  [[Category:Internet properties established in 2012  [[Category:American online magazines ","The Washington Free Beacon is an American conservative political journalism website launched in 2012.

Upon the launch of Big Journalism, he told [[Mediaite : ""Our goal at Big Journalism is to hold the mainstream media's feet to the fire. There are a lot of stories that they simply don't cover, either because it doesn't fit their world view, or because they're literally innocent of any knowledge that the story even exists, or because they are a dying organization, short-staffed, and thus can't cover stuff like they did before.""<ref name=exclusive/> Big Journalism was edited by [[Michael Walsh  author |Michael A.

It was initially edited by [[Milo Yiannopoulos  until his resignation on February 21, 2017, following the [[Milo Yiannopoulos#Alleged support for paedophilia|controversy surrounding questionable comments he made regarding hebephilia and the sexuality of children  during two podcasts. In July 2016 Yiannopoulos was banned from [[Twitter  after racist abuse was directed towards ''[[Ghostbusters  2016 film |Ghostbusters '' actress [[Leslie Jones  comedian |Leslie Jones  following Yiannopoulos's insulting tweets about her. Although Yiannopoulos's Twitter account was removed, Breitbart News has since republished the full tweet exchange and has published articles criticizing Twitter.  ====Radio==== Breitbart News Radio began daily production on [[SiriusXM Patriot  in 2015.  ===Regional sections===  ====Breitbart London==== <!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Raheem Kassam.jpg|thumb|[[Raheem Kassam , editor of Breitbart London  --> Breitbart News's London edition was launched in February 2014.

Breitbart News contributor [[Hannah Giles  posed as a prostitute fleeing an abusive [[pimp  and seeking tax and legal advice on how to run an illegal business that included the use of underage girls in the sex trade, while [[James O'Keefe , another contributor, posed as her boyfriend. They clandestinely videotaped meetings with [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN  staff who ""gave advice on house-buying and how to account on tax forms for the woman's income.""<ref name=""CA AG Report""></ref>  Andrew Breitbart paid Giles and O'Keefe $32,000 and $65,000, respectively, to film, edit and blog about the videos.<ref name=Salon_50k ></ref> Giles paid $100,000 and O'Keefe paid $50,000<ref name=Salon_50k /> to settle a lawsuit brought by former ACORN employee Juan Carlos Vera regarding the videos.

But the most damning words match the transcripts and the audio, and do not seem out of context."" However, a former Massachusetts Attorney General hired to investigate the matter found no pattern of illegal conduct by the ACORN employees and said the news media should have been far more skeptical, demanding the raw video from which the edited versions were produced.  ===Shirley Sherrod's remarks at NAACP fundraiser===  In July 2010, Breitbart News released an edited video titled ""Proof NAACP Awards Racism"" which featured [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA  official [[Shirley Sherrod  speaking at a [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  fundraising dinner in March 2010. In the video, Sherrod admits to a racial reluctance to help a white farmer obtain government aid. As a result of the video, the NAACP condemned Sherrod's remarks, and U.S. government officials called on Sherrod to resign, which she did.<ref name=snookered></ref>  The NAACP later posted the longer 43-minute video of the speech.<ref name=snookered/> In it, Sherrod said her reluctance to help a white man was wrong, and she had ended up assisting him. The NAACP then reversed their rebuke of Sherrod,<ref name=snookered/> and [[Secretary of Agriculture  [[Tom Vilsack  apologized and offered Sherrod a new government position. Andrew Breitbart said that the point of the piece was not to target Sherrod, but said the NAACP audience's reception of some parts of the speech demonstrated the same racism the NAACP's President had accused the [[Tea Party movement  of harboring. In 2011, Sherrod sued Andrew Breitbart and his business partner Larry O'Connor for [[defamation . In 2015, Sherrod and Andrew Breitbart's estate [[settlement  law |settled  the case.<ref name=""Tillman"">Zoe Tillman, [http://www.nationallawjournal.com/legaltimes/id=1202738718135/Former-USDA-Official-Settles-Defamation-Suit-Against-Breitbart-Estate ""Former USDA Official Settles Defamation Suit Against Breitbart Estate""], ''National Law Journal''  October 1, 2015 .</ref>  ===Anthony Weiner sexting scandal===  On May 28, 2011, Breitbart News's BigJournalism website reported on a sexually explicit photo linked on New York Representative [[Anthony Weiner 's [[Twitter  feed. Weiner initially denied that he had sent a 21-year-old female college student the link to the photograph, but later admitted to inappropriate online relationships. On June 6, Breitbart News reported other photos Weiner had sent, including one that was sexually explicit. Two days later, the sexually graphic photo was leaked after Andrew Breitbart participated in a radio interview with hosts [[Opie and Anthony . Andrew Breitbart stated that the photo was published without his permission. Weiner subsequently resigned from his congressional seat on June 21.  ===""Friends of Hamas"" story=== On February 7, 2013, [[Ben Shapiro  published an article on Breitbart News reporting allegations that former Senator and nominee for [[United States Secretary of Defense  [[Chuck Hagel   R-[[Nebraska   may have been paid to speak at an event sponsored by a group called ""Friends of [[Hamas ."" Breitbart News said that the story was based on exclusive information from U.S. Senate sources. The story was later repeated by ''[[RedState '', ''[[National Review '', ''[[The Washington Times|Washington Times '', and ''[[PJ Media ''.  An investigation by ''[[Slate  magazine |Slate '' reporter [[David Weigel  failed to confirm the existence of the purported group. On February 19, New York ''[[Daily News  New York |Daily News '' reporter Dan Friedman said that the story had originated from a sarcastic comment he had made to a congressional staffer. ""Friends of Hamas"" was one of several groups which Friedman considered to be so over-the-top as to be implausible and obviously fictitious. He was investigating rumors that Hagel had been paid for speaking to ""controversial organizations"", and asked sarcastically whether he had addressed ""Friends of Hamas."" Friedman followed with an email to the congressional staffer asking if Hagel had received a $25,000 fee from ""Friends of Hamas"" for his speaking engagement. No reply to the email was received, and the next day, Breitbart News ran a story with the headline ""Secret Hagel Donor?: White House Spox Ducks Question on 'Friends of Hamas'.""  Breitbart News maintained that the report was accurate, posting articles defending the website and criticizing Weigel and Friedman.<ref name=""Weigel-130223""></ref> Writers for ''[[The Washington Post '', ''[[New York  magazine |New York '' magazine and ''[[The Daily Beast ''<ref name=Freedlander ></ref> criticized Breitbart News for the ""Friends of Hamas"" story, calling it ""wrong"" and ""made-up"".  ===Nancy Pelosi/Miley Cyrus ad campaign=== In April 2014, Breitbart News created an advertising campaign to launch ''Breitbart California'', which included posters bearing an image of House minority leader [[Nancy Pelosi 's head superimposed onto singer [[Miley Cyrus 's body as seen [[twerking  on California governor [[Jerry Brown , spoofing the 2013 [[MTV Video Music Award|VMAs . [[Democratic National Committee|DNC  Chairwoman and Florida Congresswoman [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz  denounced the images as disrespectful to women. In response, House Majority Whip [[Kevin McCarthy  California politician |Kevin McCarthy  requested that his column be removed from the site.  According to Breitbart News, the inspiration for the ad campaign was a 2013 ''[[Saturday Night Live '' skit in which Cyrus appeared as a highly sexualized version of Republican Congresswoman [[Michele Bachmann  alongside a feminine, homosexual version of Republican Congressman and Speaker of the House [[John Boehner .<ref name=""Breitbart News""></ref>  ===Misidentification of Loretta Lynch=== On November 8, 2014, Breitbart News posted an article by Warner Todd Huston, which erroneously reported that [[Loretta Lynch , President Barack Obama's nominee for attorney general, had been part of [[Bill Clinton 's defense team during the [[Whitewater scandal  about the [[Whitewater Development Corporation . In fact, the Whitewater lawyer was a different Loretta Lynch. After this mistake was pointed out by ''[[Talking Points Memo '' and [[Media Matters for America , Breitbart News noted that the two Lynches were different people by correcting and appending the original article.<ref name=WaPoLynch/> Andrew Rosenthal of ''The New York Times'' editorial page editor criticized this, writing: ""The appended correction didn't really do justice to the scope of the misidentification.""<ref name=NYTLynch>[http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/no-comment-necessary-the-wrong-loretta-lynch/?_r=0 ""No Comment Necessary: The Wrong Loretta Lynch""].

[[Roger Stone , an outside adviser to Trump's campaign and frequent promoter of fringe-right conspiracy theories, regularly publishes pieces in Breitbart. A June 2016 Breitbart News article presented Stone's conspiracy theory that Clinton aide [[Huma Abedin  was involved with terrorism.  ===False report of Muslim mob in Germany=== On January 3, 2017, Breitbart News's Virginia Hale wrote that ""[a]t a New Year's Eve celebrations in [[Dortmund  a mob of more than 1,000 men chanted 'Allahu Akhbar', launched fireworks at police, and set fire to a historic church"" giving the impression of ""chaotic civil war-like conditions in Germany, caused by Islamist aggressors"" according to ''[[The Guardian ''.<ref name="":9""></ref> The story was later shown to be false; [[St. Reinold's Church, Dortmund|St. Reinold's Church  is neither the oldest church in Germany nor was the church set on fire.

In Germany, several newspapers reported on Breitbart News publishing the hoax and distorting facts for the purpose of spreading Islamophobic propaganda.<ref name="":8"" /> Breitbart News initially declined to comment,<ref name="":9"" /> but on January 8 published a story in which it stood by its claims, which had been shown to be false, and refused to admit to any exaggeration. The only correction issued was with regard to the church's age. The follow-up story used a screen capture of different fireworks at the near side of the church, with no scaffolding. ''[[Ruhr Nachrichten '', the original outlet and the alleged witness cited by Breitbart News, replied to the update, and stated that Breitbart News had not contacted them or the firefighters present to verify their story. They also reiterated the accusation against Breitbart News of exaggerating minor facts to give a false ""impression that a 'mob' of 1000 migrants had shot at Christian churches in Dortmund and set them on fire."" The newspaper went on to accuse Breitbart News of not adhering to [[journalism ethics and standards|journalistic ethics . ''Ruhr Nachrichten'' also accused Breitbart of ""using our online reports for fake news, hate and propaganda"" and published video fragments recorded on site that contradicted Breitbart News's story.<ref name="":10"" />  ===Climate change denial===  In November 2016, Breitbart News published an article summarizing a ''[[Daily Mail '' piece that falsely claimed that record-high global temperatures were unrelated to [[global warming . The Breitbart article, by [[James Delingpole , was cited by the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology , for which the latter itself was criticized. Weather.com condemned the Breitbart story in an article titled ""Note to Breitbart: Earth Is Not Cooling, Climate Change Is Real and Please Stop Using Our Video to Mislead Americans"".  In June 2017, Breitbart News published an article by Dellingpole that claimed that 58 scientific papers disproved [[Global warming|anthropogenic climate change . A number of scientists criticized the article, describing it as cherry-picking, derogatory, inaccurate, misleading, and employing flawed reasoning.  ===Wrongly picturing Lukas Podolski as a refugee=== In August 2017, Breitbart News featured a picture of professional German soccer player [[Lukas Podolski  in an article entitled ""Spanish Police Crack Gang Moving Migrants on Jet-Skis"".<ref name="":2""></ref> Podolski is neither a migrant gang member nor a victim of human trafficking.<ref name="":2"" /> The picture was of Podolski riding a jet-ski in the summer of 2014 in Brazil.<ref name="":2"" /> Breitbart News apologized to Podolski after the picture drew attention.<ref name="":2"" />  ===False story about Northern California wildfires=== In October 2017, Breitbart News published a false story claiming that an [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrant  was arrested in connection with the [[October 2017 Northern California wildfires .<ref name="":3""></ref> [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County 's sheriff department responded to Breitbart's reporting, ""This is completely false, bad, wrong information that Breitbart started and is being put out into the public.""<ref name="":3"" />  ==References==   ==Further reading== *   ==External links==  *       [[Category:Alt-right  [[Category:American news websites  [[Category:Breitbart News  [[Category:Internet properties established in 2007  [[Category:Media companies of the United States  [[Category:American political blogs  [[Category:Tea Party movement  [[Category:American conservative websites  [[Category:2007 establishments in the United States ","Breitbart News Network  known commonly as Breitbart News, Breitbart or Breitbart.com  is a far-right syndicated American news, opinion and commentary website founded in mid-2007 by conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart, who conceived it as ""the Huffington Post of the right."" Its journalists are widely considered to be ideologically driven, and some of its content has been called misogynistic, xenophobic, and racist by liberals and many traditional conservatives alike. The site has published a number of lies, conspiracy theories, and intentionally misleading stories.Breitbart News aligned with the alt-right under the management of former executive chairman Steve Bannon, who declared the website ""the platform for the alt-right"" in 2016. In 2016, Breitbart News became a virtual rallying spot for supporters of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The company's management, together with former staff member Milo Yiannopoulos, solicited ideas for stories from, and worked to advance and market ideas of, neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups and individuals. After the election, more than 2,000 organizations removed Breitbart News from ad buys following Internet activism campaigns denouncing the site's controversial positions.Breitbart News is headquartered in Los Angeles, with bureaus in Texas, London, and Jerusalem. Co-founder Larry Solov is the co-owner  along with Andrew Breitbart's widow Susie Breitbart and the Mercer family  and CEO, while Alex Marlow is the editor-in-chief, Wynton Hall is managing editor, and Joel Pollak and Peter Schweizer are senior editors-at-large."

''The Atlantic''s president is [[Bob Cohn .  ==Format, publication frequency, and name== The magazine, subscribed to by over 500,000 readers, publishes ten times a year. It was a monthly magazine for 144 years until 2001 when it published eleven issues; it has published ten issues yearly since 2003. It dropped ""Monthly"" from the cover beginning with the January/February 2004 issue, and officially changed the name in 2007. ''The Atlantic'' features articles in the fields of politics, foreign affairs, business and the economy, culture and the arts, technology, and science.  On January 22, 2008, TheAtlantic.com dropped its subscriber wall and allowed users to freely browse its site, including all past archives. By 2011 ''The Atlantic''s web properties included TheAtlanticWire.com, a news- and opinion-tracking site launched in 2009, and TheAtlanticCities.com, a stand-alone website started in 2011 that was devoted to global cities and trends.<ref name=""Folio""></ref> According to a ''[[Mashable '' profile in December 2011, ""traffic to the three web properties recently surpassed 11 million uniques per month, up a staggering 2500% since ''The Atlantic'' brought down its paywall in early 2008.""  In December 2011, a new Health Channel launched on TheAtlantic.com, incorporating coverage of food, as well as topics related to the mind, body, sex, family, and public health. Its launch was overseen by Nicholas Jackson, who had previously been overseeing the Life channel and initially joined TheAtlantic.com to cover technology. TheAtlantic.com has also expanded to visual storytelling, with the addition of the ""In Focus"" photo blog, curated by Alan Taylor. In  2011 it created its Video Channel.

In 2015, TheAtlantic.com launched a dedicated Science section and in January 2016 it redesigned and expanded its politics section in conjunction with the 2016 U.S. presidential race.  ==Literary history== [[File:Battle Hymn of the Republic.jpg|right|thumb|First publication of ""Battle Hymn of the Republic""  A leading literary magazine, ''The Atlantic'' has published many significant works and authors. It was the first to publish pieces by the abolitionists [[Julia Ward Howe   ""[[Battle Hymn of the Republic "" on February 1, 1862 , and [[William Parker  abolitionist |William Parker , whose [[slave narrative , ""The Freedman's Story"" was published in February and March 1866. It also published [[Charles W. Eliot 's ""The New Education"", a call for practical reform, that led to his appointment to presidency of [[Harvard University  in 1869; works by [[Charles Chesnutt  before he collected them in ''[[The Conjure Woman ''  1899 ; and poetry and short stories, helping launch many national literary careers. For example, [[Emily Dickinson , after reading an article in ''The Atlantic'' by [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson , asked him to become her mentor. In 2005, the magazine won a National Magazine Award for fiction. [[File:1873 AtlanticMonthly TremontSt Boston.png|thumb|left|''Atlantic Monthly'' office, Ticknor & Fields, 124 Tremont Street, Boston, ca.1868  The magazine published many of the works of [[Mark Twain , including one that was lost until 2001. Editors have recognized major cultural changes and movements. For example, of the emerging writers of the 1920s, [[Ernest Hemingway  had his short story ""[[Fifty Grand "" published in the July 1927 edition. In the midst of civil rights activism in the 20th century, the magazine published [[Martin Luther King, Jr. 's defense of [[civil disobedience  in ""[[Letter from Birmingham Jail "" in August 1963.  The magazine has published speculative articles that inspired the development of new technologies. The classic example is [[Vannevar Bush 's essay ""[[As We May Think ""  July 1945 , which inspired [[Douglas Engelbart  and later [[Ted Nelson  to develop the modern [[workstation  and [[hypertext  technology.  ''The Atlantic Monthly'' founded the Atlantic Monthly Press in 1917; for many years, it was operated in partnership with [[Little, Brown and Company . Its published book included ''[[Drums Along the Mohawk  novel |Drums Along the Mohawk ''  1936  and ''[[Blue Highways ''  1982 . The press was sold in 1986; today it is an imprint of [[Grove Atlantic .  In addition to publishing notable fiction and poetry, ''The Atlantic'' has emerged in the 21st century as an influential platform for [[Long-form journalism|longform  storytelling and newsmaker interviews. Influential cover stories have included [[Anne Marie Slaughter 's ""Why Women Still Can't Have It All""  2012  and [[Ta-Nehisi Coates 's ""Case for Reparations""  2014 . In 2015, [[Jeffrey Goldberg 's ""Obama Doctrine"" was widely discussed by American media and prompted response by many world leaders.  As of 2017, writers and frequent contributors to the print magazine include [[James Fallows , [[Jeffrey Goldberg , [[Ta-Nehisi Coates , Molly Ball, [[Caitlin Flanagan , [[James Hamblin  physician |James Hamblin , [[Julia Ioffe , [[Jonathan Rauch , [[McKay Coppins , Rosie Gray, Gillian White, Adrienne LaFrance, Vann Newkirk, Derek Thompson, [[David Frum , [[Peter Beinart , and James Parker.  ==Ownership== [[File:Atlantic Monthly 1857.png|thumb|right|The cover of [https://books.google.com/books?id=dVQCAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false the original issue of ''The Atlantic''], November 1, 1857  Until recent decades, ''The Atlantic'' was known as a distinctively [[New England  literary magazine  as opposed to ''[[Harper's '' and later ''[[The New Yorker '', both published in New York City . It achieved a national reputation and was important to the careers of many American writers and poets. By its third year, it was published by the noted Boston publishing house [[Ticknor and Fields   later to become part of [[Houghton Mifflin  , based in the city known for literary culture. The magazine was purchased in 1908 by its then editor, [[Ellery Sedgwick , but remained in Boston.  In 1980, the magazine was acquired by [[Mortimer Zuckerman , property magnate and founder of [[Boston Properties , who became its chairman. On September 27, 1999, Zuckerman transferred ownership of the magazine to [[David G. Bradley , owner of the [[National Journal Group , which focused on news of Washington, D.C., and government. Bradley had promised that the magazine would stay in Boston for the foreseeable future, as it did for the next five and a half years.  In April 2005, however, the publishers announced that the editorial offices would be moved from their longtime home at 77 North Washington Street in Boston to join the company's advertising and circulation divisions in Washington, D.C.<ref name=""leaving city""></ref> Later in August, Bradley told the ''[[New York Observer '' that the move was not made to save money — near-term savings would be $200,000–$300,000, a relatively small amount that would be swallowed by severance-related spending — but instead would serve to create a hub in Washington where the top minds from all of Bradley's publications could collaborate under the [[Atlantic Media Company  umbrella. Few of the Boston staff agreed to move, and Bradley embarked on an open search for a new editorial staff.  In 2006, Bradley hired [[James Bennet  journalist |James Bennet  as editor-in-chief; he had been the Jerusalem bureau chief for ''[[The New York Times ''. He also hired writers, including [[Jeffrey Goldberg  and [[Andrew Sullivan .<ref name=Kurtz></ref> Jay Lauf joined the organization as publisher and vice-president in 2008; as of 2017, he was publisher and president of [[Quartz  publication |''Quartz'' .  Bennet and Bob Cohn became co-presidents of ''The Atlantic'' in early 2014, and Cohn became the publication's sole president in March 2016 when Bennet was tapped to lead the New York Times editorial page. Jeffrey Goldberg was named editor in chief in October 2016.  On July 28, 2017, ''The Atlantic'' announced that multi-billionaire investor and philanthropist [[Laurene Powell Jobs   the widow of former [[Apple Inc.  chairman and CEO [[Steve Jobs   had acquired majority ownership through her [[Emerson collective|Emerson Collective  organization, with a staff member of Emerson Collective, Peter Lattman, being immediately named as ''The Atlantic'''s vice chairman. [[David G. Bradley  and Atlantic Media retained a minority share position in this sale.  ==Politics== Throughout its history, ''The Atlantic'' has been reluctant to recommend candidates in elections. In 1860, three years into publication, ''The Atlantic'''s then-editor [[James Russell Lowell  endorsed [[Republican Party  United States |Republican  [[Abraham Lincoln  for his first run for president and also endorsed the [[abolition of slavery .   In 1964, 104 years later, Edward Weeks wrote on behalf of the editorial board in endorsing [[Democratic Party  United States |Democratic  President [[Lyndon B. Johnson  and rebuking Republican [[Barry Goldwater 's candidacy.  In 2016, the editorial board endorsed a presidential candidate, Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton , for the third time since the magazine's founding, in a rebuke of Republican [[Donald Trump 's candidacy. After the election, the magazine has become a strong critic of President Trump. The March 2019 cover article, by editor [[Yoni Appelbaum , formally calls for the [[impeachment of Donald Trump : “It’s time for Congress to judge the president’s fitness to serve.”<ref name=ImpeachDonaldTrump></ref>  ==''The Wire''== ''The Wire''  previously known as ''The Atlantic Wire''  was a sister site of TheAtlantic.com that aggregated news and opinions from online, print, radio, and television outlets.<ref name=""CJR20090916""></ref> When ''The Atlantic Wire'' launched in 2009, it curated [[op-ed s from across the media spectrum and summarized significant positions in each debate.<ref name=""CJR20090916""/> Expanded to encompass news and original reporting, regular features include ""What I Read"", showcasing the [[media diet s of individuals from the worlds of entertainment, journalism, and politics, and ""Trimming the Times"", a summary of the feature editor's choices of the best content in ''The New York Times''. ''The Atlantic Wire'' rebranded itself as ''The Wire'' in November 2013.  ''The Wire'' was folded back into ''The Atlantic'' in 2014.  ==''CityLab''==  CityLab  formerly ''The Atlantic Cities''  is the latest expansion of ''The Atlantic''s digital properties, launched in September 2011. The stand-alone site has been described as exploring and explaining ""the most innovative ideas and pressing issues facing today's global cities and neighborhoods.""  The site was co-founded as ''The Atlantic Cities'' by [[Richard Florida , urban theorist and professor. In 2014, it was rebranded as CityLab.com. Today, CityLab.com's coverage areas include design, politics, crime, and housing. Among its offerings are Navigator, ""a guide to urban life,"" and CityFixer, which curates solutions-based stories around a dozen topics.  In 2015, CityLab partnered with [[Univision  to launch CityLab Latino, which features original journalism in Spanish as well as translated reporting from CityLab.com.  == The Aspen Ideas Festival == In 2005, ''The Atlantic'' and the [[Aspen Institute  launched the Aspen Ideas Festival, a ten-day event in and around the city of Aspen, Colorado. The annual conference features 350 presenters, 200 sessions and 3,000 attendees. The event has been called a ""political who's who"" as it often features policymakers, journalists, lobbyists and think tank leaders.  ==Reputation== In June 2006, the ''[[Chicago Tribune '' named ''The Atlantic'' one of the top ten English-language magazines, describing it as ""a gracefully aging ... 150-year-old granddaddy of periodicals"" because ""it keeps us smart and in the know"" with cover stories on the then-forthcoming fight over ''[[Roe v. Wade ''. It also lauded regular features such as ""Word Fugitives"" and ""Primary Sources"" as ""cultural barometers.""  On January 14, 2013, ''The Atlantic''s website published ""[[Native advertising|sponsor content "" promoting [[David Miscavige , the leader of the [[Church of Scientology . While the magazine had previously published advertising looking like articles, this one was widely criticized. The page comments were moderated by the marketing team, not by editorial staff, and comments critical of the church were being removed. Later that day, ''The Atlantic'' removed the piece from its website and issued an apology.<ref name=""Apology"">[https://www.magnetmail.net/actions/email_web_version.cfm?recipient_id=699462885&message_id=2459857&user_id=NJG_Atlan&group_id=0&jobid=12656579 Statement from The Atlantic], Natalie Raabe.</ref><ref name=""WaPo"">[[Erik Wemple|Wemple, Erik , [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/01/15/the-atlantics-scientology-problem-start-to-finish/ ""The Atlantic's Scientology problem, start to finish""], ''[[The Washington Post '' blog, January 15, 2013.</ref><ref name=""NYTimes"">[[Brian Stelter|Stelter, Brian , and Christine Haughney, [http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/the-atlantic-apologizes-for-scientology-ad/?_r=0 ""The Atlantic Apologizes for Scientology Ad""], January 15, 2013, ''The New York Times''.</ref>  ==List of editors== * [[James Russell Lowell , 1857–61 * [[James Thomas Fields , 1861–71 * [[William Dean Howells , 1871–81 * [[Thomas Bailey Aldrich , 1881–90 * [[Horace Elisha Scudder , 1890–98 * [[Walter Hines Page , 1898–99 * [[Bliss Perry , 1899–1909 * [[Ellery Sedgwick , 1909–38 * [[Edward A.

It has won twelve [[Pulitzer Prize s since 1964, and in 2009, won two in a single year for the first time in its history, one of which was for its [[PolitiFact  project. It is published by the [[Times Publishing Company , which is owned by [[Poynter Institute|The Poynter Institute for Media Studies , a nonprofit [[journalism school  directly adjacent to the [[University of South Florida St. Petersburg  campus. Many issues are available through [[Google News Archive . A daily electronic version is also available for the [[Amazon Kindle  and [[iPad .  ==History== [[File:St. Petersburg Times  2009-08-27 .svg|left|thumb|Logo of the ''St. Petersburg Times'' in 2009   The newspaper traces its origins to the ''West Hillsborough Times'', a weekly newspaper established in [[Dunedin, Florida  on the [[Pinellas  peninsula in 1884. At the time, neither St. Petersburg nor [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas County  existed; the peninsula was part of [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County . The paper was published weekly in the back of a pharmacy and had a circulation of 480. It subsequently changed ownership six times in seventeen years.<ref name=""History""></ref> In December 1884 it was bought by A. C. Turner,<ref name=""history2"" /> who moved it to [[Clear Water Harbor   modern [[Clearwater, Florida  .<ref name=""History"" /> In 1892 it moved to St. Petersburg,<ref name=""History"" /> and by 1898 it was officially renamed the St. Petersburg Times.<ref name=Deggans></ref>  The ''Times'' became [[Bi-weekly newspaper|bi-weekly  in 1907, and began publication six days a week in 1912. Paul Poynter, a publisher originally from Indiana, bought the paper in September 1912 and converted to a seven-day paper, though it was rarely financially stable. Paul's son, [[Nelson Poynter , became editor in 1939 and took majority control of the paper in 1947, and set about improving the paper's finances and prestige. Nelson Poynter controlled the paper until his death in 1978, when he willed the majority of the stock to the non-profit [[Poynter Institute .<ref name=""History"" /> In November 1986, the ''[[Evening Independent '' was merged into the ''Times''. Poynter was succeeded by [[Eugene Patterson   1978–1988 ,<ref name=""History"" /> Andrew Barnes  1988–2004 ,<ref name=""History"" /> [[Paul Tash   2004–2010; chair and chief executive officer of the Poynter Institute and the Times Publishing Company since 2010 <ref name=""History"" /> and Neil Brown  2010–2017 .  On January 1, 2012, the '''''St. Petersburg Times''''' was renamed the '''''Tampa Bay Times'''''; this stemmed from a 2006 decision of a lawsuit with [[Media General , at the time the publishers of the ''Times'' competing newspaper, ''[[The Tampa Tribune '', which allowed that paper to keep its exclusive right to use the name of its defunct sister paper, ''The Tampa Times'', for five years after the decision.<ref name=""Deggans"" />  As the newly rechristened ''Tampa Bay Times'', the paper's weekday tabloid ''tbt*'', a free daily publication and which used "" * Tampa Bay Times "" as its subtitle, became just ''tbt'' when the name change took place.<ref name=Deggans/> The ''St. Pete Times'' name lives on as the name for the ''Times'' neighborhood news sections in southern [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas County   formerly ''Neighborhood Times'' , serving communities from [[Largo, Florida|Largo  southward.  [[File:Tbt  2018-01-24 .svg|thumb|Logo of the free tabloid ''tbt*'' in 2018  [[File:Tampa Bay Times tbt  2009-08-27 .svg|thumb|Logo of the free tabloid ''tbt*'' in 2009  The ''Times'' has also done significant investigative reporting on the [[Church of Scientology , since the church's acquisition of the [[Fort Harrison Hotel  in 1975 and other holdings in [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater . The ''Times'' has published special reports and series critical of the church and its current leader, [[David Miscavige .<ref name=""TruthRunDown""></ref>  In 2010, the ''Times'' published an investigative report questioning the validity of the [[United States Navy Veterans Association , leading to significant reaction and official investigations into the group nationwide.<ref name=""rt1""></ref>  On May 3, 2016, the ''Times'' acquired its longtime competitor ''The Tampa Tribune'', with the latter publication immediately ceasing publishing<ref name=WFLA></ref> and ''Tribune'' features and some writers expected to be merged into the ''Times''. As reported by other local media outlets in the Tampa Bay area at the time of this acquisition, for many years the ''Tampa Tribune'' was considered to be the more [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative  newspaper in the region, while the ''Tampa Bay Times'' was thought of as more [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal .<ref name=""WFLA"" />   The ''Times'' purchase of ''The Tribune'' also allowed its circulation area to be expanded into [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County , placing it in competition with other newspapers such as ''[[The Ledger|The Lakeland Ledger '' and ''[[The Polk County Democrat '', as well as into the south central region of the state known as the [[Florida Heartland .  In the case of the latter, the ''Times'' published ''[[Highlands Today '', which was a daily news supplement of ''The Tribune'' for readers in [[Highlands County, Florida|Highlands County . The ''Times'' sold the paper in 2016 to Sun Coast Media Group.  ==PolitiFact.com==  The newspaper created [[PolitiFact.com , a project in which its reporters and editors ""fact-check statements by members of Congress, the White House, lobbyists and interest groups…"" They publish original statements and their evaluations on the PolitiFact.com website, and assign each a ""Truth-O-Meter"" rating, with ratings ranging from ""True"" for completely true statements to ""Pants on Fire""  from the taunt ""Liar, liar, pants on fire""  for false and ridiculous statements. The site also includes an ""Obameter"", tracking [[President of the United States|U.S. President  [[Barack Obama 's performance with regard to his campaign promises. PolitiFact.com was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting  in 2009 for ""its fact-checking initiative during the 2008 presidential campaign that used probing reporters and the power of the World Wide Web to examine more than 750 political claims, separating rhetoric from truth to enlighten voters.""<ref name=Pulitzer2009></ref> The ''Times'' sold PolitiFact.com to its parent company, the Poynter Institute, in 2018.  ==Awards and nominations== {| class=""wikitable"" |- style=""text-align:center;"" ! style=""background:#B0C4DE;"" | Year ! style=""background:#B0C4DE;"" | Award ! style=""background:#B0C4DE;"" | Work ! style=""background:#B0C4DE;"" | Recipients ! style=""background:#B0C4DE;"" | Category ! style=""background:#B0C4DE;"" | Result |- |2016 |[[Pulitzer Prize  |""For exposing a local school board's culpability in turning some county schools into failure factories, with tragic consequences for the community.

Based on 2015 statistics, it is Canada's [[list of newspapers in Canada by circulation|highest-circulation newspaper  on overall weekly circulation; although it is a close second to ''[[The Globe and Mail '' in daily circulation on weekdays, it overtakes the ''Globe'' in weekly circulation because the ''Globe'' does not publish a Sunday edition. The ''Toronto Star'' is owned by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, a subsidiary of [[Torstar|Torstar Corporation  and part of Torstar's [[Daily News Brands  Torstar |Daily News Brands  division.  ==History== [[Image:Horatio Clarence Hocken.png|thumb|left|[[Horatio Clarence Hocken , founder of the ''Star''   ===Formation=== The ''Star''  originally known as the ''Evening Star'' and then the ''Toronto Daily Star''  was created in [[1892  by striking ''[[Toronto News '' printers and writers, led by future [[Mayor of Toronto  and social reformer [[Horatio Clarence Hocken , who became the newspaper's founder, along with another future mayor, [[James Simpson  politician |Jimmy Simpson .  ''The Star'' was first printed on ''[[The Toronto World|Toronto World '' presses, and at its formation, ''The World'' owned a 51% interest in it as a [[wikt:silent partner|silent partner . That arrangement only lasted for two months, during which time it was rumoured that [[William Findlay Maclean|William Findlay ""Billy"" Maclean , the ''World'''s proprietor, was considering selling the ''Star'' to the Riordon family.  After an extensive fundraising campaign among the ''Star'' staff, Maclean agreed to sell his interest to Hocken.5   The paper did poorly in its first few years. Hocken sold out within the year, and several owners followed in succession until railway entrepreneur [[William Mackenzie  railway entrepreneur |Sir William Mackenzie  bought it in 1896.6  Its new editors, [[Edmund E. Sheppard  and [[Frederic Thomas Nicholls , moved the entire ''Star'' operation into the same building used by the magazine ''[[Saturday Night  magazine |Saturday Night ''. This would continue until [[Joseph E. Atkinson|Joseph E. ""Holy Joe"" Atkinson , backed by funds raised by supporters of Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier , bought the paper. The supporters included [[George Albertus Cox|Senator George Cox , [[William Mulock , [[Peter Charles Larkin  and [[Timothy Eaton .  ===Atkinson's influence=== [[Image:Joseph Edward Atkinson.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joseph E. Atkinson , c. 1910s  Atkinson was the ''Star''s editor from 1899 until his death in 1948. Its early opposition and criticism of the [[Nazi Party|Nazi regime  saw the paper become one of the first North American papers to be banned in Germany.  Atkinson had a social conscience. He championed many causes that would come to be associated with the modern [[welfare state : [[old age pension s, [[Unemployment benefits|unemployment insurance , and [[health care . The [[Government of Canada  Digital Collections website describes Atkinson as<blockquote>a ""radical"" in the best sense of that term.... The ''Star'' was unique among North American newspapers in its consistent, ongoing advocacy of the interests of ordinary people. The friendship of Atkinson, the publisher, with [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King , the [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister , was a major influence on the development of Canadian social policy.</blockquote>  Atkinson became the controlling [[shareholder  of the ''Star''. The ''Star'' was frequently criticized for practising the [[yellow journalism  of its era. For decades, the paper included heavy doses of crime and sensationalism, along with advocating social change. From 1910 to 1973, the ''Star'' published a weekend supplement, the ''[[Star Weekly ''.  Shortly before his death in 1948, Joseph E. Atkinson transferred ownership of the paper to a charitable organization given the mandate of continuing the paper's liberal tradition. In 1949, the Province of Ontario passed the ''Charitable Gifts Act'',, repealed in 2009 by the   barring charitable organizations from owning large parts of profit-making businesses, that effectively required the ''Star'' to be sold.  Atkinson's will had directed that profits from the paper's operations were ""for the promotion and maintenance of social, scientific and economic reforms which are charitable in nature, for the benefit of the people of the province of Ontario"" and it stipulated that the paper could be sold only to people who shared his social views. The five trustees of the charitable organization circumvented the Act by buying the paper themselves and swearing before the [[Supreme Court of Ontario  to continue what became known as the ""Atkinson Principles"": * A strong, united and independent Canada * Social justice * Individual and civil liberties * Community and civic engagement * The rights of working people * The necessary role of government  Descendants of the original owners, known as ""the five families"", still control the voting shares of [[Torstar , and the Atkinson Principles continue to guide the paper to this day. In February 2006, ''Star'' media columnist [[Antonia Zerbisias  wrote on her blog:  <blockquote>Besides, we are the ''Star'' which means we all have the Atkinson Principles—and its multi-culti values—tattooed on our butts. Fine with me. At least we are upfront about our values, and they almost always work in favour of building a better Canada.</blockquote>  ===Involvement with broadcasting=== [[Image:TorontoStar3.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Old Toronto Star Building , 80 King St West, in 1961  From 1922 to 1933, the ''Star'' was also a radio broadcaster on its station [[CFCA  AM |CFCA , broadcasting on a [[wavelength  of 400 [[metre s  749.48 kHz , whose coverage was complementary to the paper's reporting.<ref name=""Plummer2014""></ref> The station was closed following the establishment of the [[Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission  and the introduction of a government policy that, in essence, restricted private stations to an [[effective radiated power  of 100 [[watt s.<ref name=""Plummer2014"" /> The ''Star'' would continue to supply sponsored content to the CRBC's CRCT station  which later became CBC station [[CBLA-FM|CBL  , an arrangement that lasted until 1946.<ref name=""Plummer2014"" />  ===1970s to present=== In 1971, the newspaper was renamed ''The Toronto Star'' and moved to a modern office tower at [[One Yonge Street  by [[Queens Quay  Toronto |Queens Quay . The original ''Star'' Building at [[Old Toronto Star Building|80 King Street West  was demolished to make room for [[First Canadian Place . The new building originally housed the paper's presses. In 1992, the printing plant was moved to the [[Toronto Star Press Centre  at the [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407  & [[Ontario Highway 400|400  interchange in [[Vaughan . In September 2002, the logo was changed, and ""The"" was dropped from the papers. During the [[Northeast blackout of 2003|2003 Northeast blackout , the ''Star'' printed the paper at a press in [[Welland , [[Ontario .  Until the mid-2000s, the front page of the ''Toronto Star'' had no advertising aside from lottery jackpot estimates from the [[Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation   OLG .  On May 28, 2007, the ''Star'' unveiled a redesigned paper that features larger type, narrower pages, fewer and shorter articles, renamed sections, more prominence to local news, and less so to international news, columnists, and opinion pieces. However, on January 1, 2009, the ''Star'' reverted to its previous format. ''Star P.M.'', a free newspaper in [[PDF  format that could be downloaded from the newspaper's website each weekday afternoon, was discontinued in October 2007, thirteen months after its launch.  On January 15, 2016, Torstar confirmed the closure of its Vaughan printing presses and that it will outsource printing to [[Transcontinental  company |Transcontinental Printing , leading to the layoff of all 285 staff at the plant as Transcontinental has its own existing facility, also in Vaughan.  In 2018, The Toronto Star expanded its local coverge of Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Halifax with rebranded daily newspapers, previously known as Metro, as [[StarMetro  newspaper |StarMetro .   In 2018, The ''Toronto Star'' aquired [[iPolitics , a political news outlet.  ==The ''Star'' brand== [[Image:Toronto Star Building.JPG|right|thumb|[[One Yonge Street  – Current head office, built in 1970   ===Editorial position=== Like its competitor ''[[The Globe and Mail '', the ''Star'' covers ""a spectrum of opinion that is best described as urban and [[Central Canada|Central Canadian "" in character.

Conversely, Canadian sociologist Elke Winter wrote in 2011 that the ''Toronto Star'' was less ""Toronto-centric"" than its rival, ''The Globe and Mail'', writing that the ''Star'' ""consciously reports for and from Canada's most multicultural city"" and catered to a diverse readership.<ref name=""Winter"" />  ====Election endorsements==== In the 50 years to 1972, the ''Star'' endorsed the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party  in each [[List of Canadian federal general elections|federal general election .<ref name=""English"">Kathy English, [https://www.thestar.com/news/politics/federalelection/2008/10/11/why_do_newspapers_endorse.html Why do newspapers endorse?], ''Toronto Star''  October 11, 2008 .</ref> In the 14 federal elections between 1968 and 2015, the ''Star'' endorsed the Liberal Party ten times, the [[New Democratic Party  two times, and the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party  two times.<ref name=""Wallace"" />  Elections in which the ''Star'' did not endorse the Liberals took place in [[Canadian federal election, 1972|1972  and [[Canadian federal election, 1974|1974 ,  when it endorsed the Progressive Conservatives , and [[Canadian federal election, 1979|1979  and [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011   when it endorsed the NDP .<ref name=""English"" /><ref name=""Wallace"" /> In the 2011 election in which the ''Star'' [[Newspaper endorsements in the Canadian federal election, 2011|endorsed the NDP  under [[Jack Layton ,<ref name=""2011endorsement""></ref> but to avoid [[vote-splitting  that could inadvertently help the Conservatives under [[Stephen Harper , which it saw as the worst outcome for the country, the paper also recommended Canadians [[Tactical voting|vote strategically  by voting for ""the progressive candidate best placed to win"" in certain ridings.<ref name=""strategicvoting""></ref> For the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 election , the ''Star'' endorsed the Liberal Party under [[Justin Trudeau .<ref name=""2015endorsement""></ref>  In Toronto's [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan  mayoral elections, the ''Star'' endorsed [[George Smitherman  in [[Toronto mayoral election, 2010|2010 , and [[John Tory  in 2014.  ===Features=== [[Image:Toronto Star paperboy Whitby.jpg|thumb|right|''Toronto Star'' paperboy in [[Whitby, Ontario|Whitby  in 1940  The ''Star'' is one of the few Canadian newspapers that employs a ""[[public editor ""  [[ombudsman   and was the first to do so.

Located at the [[Guild Park and Gardens  in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough .  The advent of the ''[[National Post '' in 1998 shook up the Toronto newspaper market. In the upheaval that followed, editorial spending increased and there was much hiring and firing of editors and publishers.  ==Current developments== ===''Sing Tao Daily''=== [[Image:SingTaoDailyToronto.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sing Tao Daily  Canada |''Sing Tao Daily''  editorial office in [[Markham, Ontario   In 1998,<ref name=""Lost in Translation""></ref> the ''Toronto Star'' purchased a majority stake in Sing Tao's Canadian newspaper [[Sing Tao Daily  Canada |''Sing Tao Daily'' , which it jointly owns with [[Sing Tao News Corporation .<ref name=""Star Media Group""></ref> ''Sing Tao Daily'' encountered controversy in April 2008, after media watchers discovered the paper had altered a translated ''Toronto Star'' article about the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games  protests to adhere to Chinese government's official line.<ref name=""Lost in Translation"" /> ''Sing Tao''s then-editor Wilson Chan was fired over this.<ref name=""Editor Dismissed""></ref>  ===Paywall=== In October 2012, the ''Star'' announced its intention to implement a [[paywall  on its website, thestar.com, which was made effective on August 13, 2013. Readers with daily home delivery had free access to all its digital content. Those without a digital subscription can view up to ten articles a month. The paywall does not apply to its sister sites, such as wheels.ca  automotive news and classifieds  or [[Workopolis   career search . However, during late 2013, the ''Star'' announced that it would end its paywall, which it did on April 1, 2015.   In June 2018, the ''Star'' announced it was implementing a paywall again and has the same restrictions as its previous paywall implementation.  ===Star Touch tablet app=== On September 15, 2015, the ''Toronto Star'' released the Toronto Star Touch tablet app, which was a free interactive news app with interactive advertisements. It was discontinued in 2017. At launch, it was only available for the [[iPad , which uses [[iOS . Based on a similar app for Montreal-based ''[[La Presse  Canadian newspaper |La Presse '' released in 2013, Star Touch is the first such app for any English-language news organization, quality-wise. In slightly over 50 days since launch, the app had reached the 100,000-download milestone. The [[Android  operating system |Android  version was launched on December 1, 2015.

Another Orlando paper, the ''South Florida Sentinel'', started publishing as a morning daily in 1913. Then known as the ''Morning Sentinel'', it bought the ''Reporter-Star'' in 1931, when Martin Andersen came to Orlando to manage both papers. Andersen eventually bought both papers outright in 1945, selling them to the [[Tribune Company  of Chicago in 1965.<ref name=""timeline""></ref>  In 1973, the two publications merged into the daily '''''Sentinel Star'''''.

The newspaper was renamed the ''Orlando Sentinel'' in 1982. John Puerner succeeded Lifvendahl in 1993, who was replaced by Kathleen M. Waltz in 2000. She announced her resignation in February 2008. Howard Greenberg, already publisher of fellow Tribune newspaper the ''[[Sun-Sentinel '' of Fort Lauderdale, was named publisher of both papers after Waltz left.  In 2008, the Tribune Company called for a redesign of the ''Sentinel''.

''On the Short Waves, 1923–1945: Broadcast Listening in the Pioneer Days of Radio.'' 1999, McFarland. , 105</ref> Privately controlled shortwave networks included the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company 's International Network  or White Network , which broadcast in six languages, the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System 's Latin American international network, which consisted of 64 stations located in 18 different countries, and the [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation  in Cincinnati, Ohio, all of which had shortwave transmitters. Experimental programming began in the 1930s, but there were fewer than 12 transmitters in operation.<ref name=""Dizard_24""></ref> In 1939, the Federal Communications Commission set the following policy:  <blockquote>A licensee of an international broadcast station shall render only an international broadcast service which will reflect the culture of this country and which will promote international goodwill, understanding and cooperation. Any program solely intended for, and directed to an audience in the continental United States does not meet the requirements for this service.</blockquote>  This policy was intended to enforce the State Department's [[Good Neighbor Policy , but some broadcasters felt that it was an attempt to direct censorship.  Shortwave signals to Latin America were regarded as vital to counter Nazi propaganda around 1940.<ref name=""Dizard_24""/> Initially, the Office of Coordination of Information sent releases to each station, but this was seen as an inefficient means of transmitting news.<ref name=""Berg, Jerome S. 1999, page 105"" /> The director of Latin American relations at the Columbia Broadcasting System was [[Edmund A. Chester , and he supervised the development of CBS's extensive ""La Cadena de las Americas"" radio network to improve broadcasting to South America during the 1940s.     Also included among the [[cultural diplomacy  programming on the Columbia Broadcasting System was the musical show ''[[Viva America ''  1942-1949  which featured the Pan American Orchestra and the artistry of several noted musicians from both North and South America, including [[Alfredo Antonini , [[Juan Arvizu , [[Eva Garza , [[Elsa Miranda , [[Nestor Mesta Chayres|Nestor Mesta Chaires , [[Miguel Sandoval  composer |Miguel Sandoval , [[John Serry Sr. , and [[Terig Tucci . By 1945, broadcasts of the show were carried by 114 stations on CBS's ""La Cadena de las Americas"" network in 20 Latin American nations. These broadcasts proved to be highly successful in supporting President [[Franklin Roosevelt 's policy of [[Pan-Americanism  throughout South America during World War II.   ===World War II=== Even before the [[Japan ese [[attack on Pearl Harbor , the U.S. government’s [[Office of the Coordinator of Information   COI, in Washington  had already begun providing war news and commentary to the commercial American shortwave radio stations for use on a voluntary basis through its Foreign Information Service  FIS, in New York  headed by playwright [[Robert E. Sherwood , the playwright who served as president [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Roosevelt ’s speech writer and information advisor. Direct programming began a week after the United States’ entry into World War II in December 1941, with the first broadcast from the San Francisco office of the FIS via a leased [[General Electric ’s transmitter to the Philippines in English  other languages followed . The next step was to broadcast to [[Germany , which was called ''Stimmen aus Amerika''  ""Voices from America""  and was transmitted on February 1, 1942. It was introduced by ""[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic "" and included the pledge: ""Today, and every day from now on, we will be with you from America to talk about the war... The news may be good or bad for us – We will always tell you the truth."" Roosevelt approved this broadcast, which then-Colonel [[William J. Donovan   COI  and Sherwood  FIS  had recommended to him. It was Sherwood who actually coined the term ""The Voice of America"" to describe the shortwave network that began its transmissions on February 1, from 270 Madison Avenue in New York City.  The [[Office of War Information , when organized in the middle of 1942, officially took over VOA's operations. VOA reached an agreement with the [[British Broadcasting Corporation  to share medium-wave transmitters in [[Great Britain|Britain , and expanded into [[Tunis  in North Africa and [[Palermo  and [[Bari, Italy  as the Allies captured these territories. The OWI also set up the [[American Broadcasting Station in Europe . [[Asia n transmissions started with one transmitter in [[California  in 1941; services were expanded by adding transmitters in [[Hawaii  and, after recapture, the [[Philippines .<ref name=""Dizard_25""></ref>  By the end of the war, VOA had 39 transmitters and provided service in 40 languages.<ref name=""Dizard_25""/> Programming was broadcast from production centers in New York and [[San Francisco , with more than 1,000 programs originating from New York. Programming consisted of music, news, commentary, and relays of U.S. domestic programming, in addition to specialized VOA programming.  About half of VOA's services, including the [[Arabic language|Arabic  service, were discontinued in 1945.<ref name=""Rugh 2006, 13""></ref> In late 1945, VOA was transferred to the Department of State.  ===Cold War=== <!--many paragraphs without citations, especially at end of section--> In 1947, VOA started broadcasting to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet  citizens in Russia under the pretext of countering ""more harmful instances of [[Soviet propaganda  directed against American leaders and policies"" on the part of the internal Soviet Russian-language media, according to John B. Whitton's treatise, ''Cold War Propaganda''.<ref name=""whitton""></ref> The Soviet Union responded by initiating electronic [[radio jamming|jamming  of VOA broadcasts on April 24, 1949.<ref name=""whitton""/>  [[Charles W. Thayer  headed VOA in 1948–49.  Over the next few years, the U.S. government debated the best role of Voice of America. The decision was made to use VOA broadcasts as a part of its [[foreign policy  to fight the propaganda of the [[Soviet Union  and other countries.  The Arabic service resumed on January 1, 1950, with a half-hour program. This program grew to 14.5 hours daily during the [[Suez Crisis  of 1956, and was six hours a day by 1958.<ref name=""Rugh 2006, 13""/>  In 1952, Voice of America installed a studio and relay facility aboard a converted [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard  [[Cutter  ship |cutter  renamed ''[[USCGC Courier  WAGR-410 |Courier '' whose [[target audience  was Soviet Union and other members of [[Warsaw Pact . The ''Courier'' was originally intended to become the first in a fleet of mobile, radio broadcasting ships  see [[offshore radio   that built upon [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy  experience during WWII in using warships as floating broadcasting stations. However, the ''Courier'' eventually dropped anchor off the island of [[Rhodes, Greece  with permission of the [[Politics of Greece|Greek government  to avoid being branded as a [[pirate radio  broadcasting ship. This VOA offshore station stayed on the air until the 1960s when facilities were eventually provided on land. The ''Courier'' supplied training to engineers who later worked on several of the European commercial offshore broadcasting stations of the 1950s and 1960s.  Control of VOA passed from the State Department to the [[U.S. Information Agency  when the latter was established in 1953.<ref name=""Rugh 2006, 13""/> to transmit worldwide, including to the countries behind the Iron Curtain and to the People's Republic of China  PRC .  Starting in the 1950s, VOA [[Voice of America Jazz Hour|broadcast American jazz ,  with [[Willis Conover  hosting a daily program from 1955 until 1996, which was highly popular worldwide drawing 30 million listeners at its peak. A program aimed at [[South Africa  in 1956 broadcast two hours nightly, and special programs such as ''The [[Newport Jazz Festival '' were also transmitted. This was done in association with tours by U.S. musicians, such as [[Dizzy Gillespie , [[Louis Armstrong , and [[Duke Ellington , sponsored by the State Department. From August 1952 through May 1953, Billy Brown, a high school senior in [[Westchester County, New York , had a Monday night program in which he shared everyday happenings in [[Yorktown Heights, New York . Brown's program ended due to its popularity: his ""chatty narratives"" attracted so much fan mail, VOA couldn't afford the $500 a month in clerical and postage costs required to respond to listeners' letters.  Throughout the [[Cold War , many of the targeted countries' governments sponsored [[radio jamming|jamming  of VOA broadcasts, which sometimes led critics to question the broadcasts' actual impact. For example, in 1956, [[Polish People's Republic  stopped jamming VOA transmissions , but [[People's Republic of Bulgaria  continued to jam the signal through the 1970s. [[Chinese language  VOA broadcasts were jammed beginning in 1956 and extending through 1976. However, after the collapse of the [[Warsaw Pact  and the Soviet Union, interviews with participants in anti-Soviet movements verified the effectiveness of VOA broadcasts in transmitting information to socialist societies. The People's Republic of China diligently jams VOA broadcasts. [[Cuba  has also been reported to interfere with VOA satellite transmissions to [[Iran  from its Russian-built transmission site at [[Bejucal . David Jackson, former director of Voice of America, noted: ""The [[North Korea n government doesn't jam us, but they try to keep people from listening through intimidation or worse. But people figure out ways to listen despite the odds. They're very resourceful.""  Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, VOA covered some of the era's most important news, including [[Martin Luther King, Jr. 's ""[[I Have a Dream "" speech and [[Neil Armstrong 's first walk on the moon. During the [[Cuban missile crisis , VOA broadcast around-the-clock in [[Spanish language|Spanish .  In the early 1980s, VOA began a $1.3 billion rebuilding program to improve broadcast with better technical capabilities. Also in the 1980s, VOA also added a television service, as well as special regional programs to Cuba, [[Radio Martí  and [[TV Martí . Cuba has consistently attempted to jam such broadcasts and has vociferously protested U.S. broadcasts directed at Cuba.  In September 1980, VOA started broadcasting to [[Afghanistan  in [[Dari language|Dari  and in [[Pashto language|Pashto  in 1982. At the same time, VOA started to broadcast U.S. government editorials, clearly separated from the programming by audio cues.  In 1985, VOA Europe was created as a special service in English that was relayed via satellite to AM, FM, and cable affiliates throughout Europe. With a contemporary format including live [[disc jockey s, the network presented top musical hits as well as VOA news and features of local interest  such as ""EuroFax""  24 hours a day. VOA Europe was closed down without advance public notice in January 1997 as a cost-cutting measure. It was followed by VOA Express, which from July 4, 1999 revamped into VOA Music Mix. Since November 1, 2014 stations are offered VOA1  which is a rebranding of VOA Music Mix .  In 1989, Voice of America expanded its [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin  and [[Cantonese Chinese|Cantonese  programming to reach the millions of Chinese and inform the country, accurately about the pro-democracy movement within the country, including the demonstration in Tiananmen Square.  Starting in 1990, the U.S. consolidated its international broadcasting efforts, with the establishment of the Bureau of Broadcasting.  ===Post–Cold War=== With the breakup of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe, VOA added many additional language services to reach those areas. This decade was marked by the additions of Tibetan, Kurdish  to Iran and Iraq , Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, Macedonian, and [[Rwanda-Rundi  language services.  In 1993, the [[Clinton administration  advised cutting funding for [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty  as it was felt post-Cold War information and influence was not needed in Europe. This plan was not well received, and he then proposed the compromise of the International Broadcasting Act. The [[Broadcasting Board of Governors  was established and took control from the Board for International Broadcasters which previously oversaw funding for RFE/RL.<ref name=""Raghavan"" />  In 1994, President Clinton signed the International Broadcasting Act into law. This law established the International Broadcasting Bureau as a part of the U.S. Information Agency and created the Broadcasting Board of Governors with oversight authority. In 1998, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act was signed into law and mandated that BBG become an independent federal agency as of October 1, 1999. This act also abolished the U.S.I.A. and merged most of its functions with those of the State Department.  In 1994, Voice of America became the first broadcast-news organization to offer continuously updated programs on the Internet.  === Cuts in services === The Arabic Service was abolished in 2002 and replaced by a new radio service, called the Middle East Radio Network or [[Radio Sawa , with an initial budget of $22 million. Radio Sawa offered mostly Western and Middle Eastern popular songs with periodic brief news bulletins.  In May 16, 2004; [[Worldnet Television and Film Service|Worldnet , a satellite television service, was merged into the VOA network.  Radio programs in Russian ended in July 2008.<ref name=""post""/> In September 2008, VOA eliminated the Hindi language service after 53 years.<ref name=""post""></ref>  Broadcasts in Ukrainian, Serbian, Macedonian and Bosnian also ended.<ref name=""publica""></ref> These reductions were part of American efforts to concentrate more resources to broadcast to the Muslim world.<ref name=""post""/><ref name=""publica""/>  In September 2010, VOA started radio broadcasts in Sudan. As U.S. interests in [[South Sudan  have grown, there is a desire to provide people with free information.  In 2013, VOA finished foreign language transmissions on shortwave and medium wave to Albania, Georgia, Iran and Latin America; as well as English language broadcasts to the Middle East and Afghanistan.<ref name=""inside""></ref> The movement was done due to budget cuts.<ref name=""inside""/>  On July 1, 2014, VOA cut most of its shortwave transmissions in English to Asia.<ref name=""arrl""></ref> Shortwave broadcasts in Azerbaijani, Bengali, Khmer, Kurdish, Lao, and Uzbek were dropped too.<ref name=""arrl""/> On August 11, 2014, the Greek service ended after 72 years on air.  === List of languages === {| class=""wikitable sortable"" style=""font-size: 87%;"" !

From its founding in 1942 to 1945, it was part of the [[Office of War Information , and then from 1945 to 1953 as a function of the State Department. VOA was placed under the [[U.S. Information Agency  in 1953. When the USIA was abolished in 1999, VOA was placed under the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors , or BBG, which is an autonomous U.S. government agency, with bipartisan membership. The Secretary of State has a seat on the BBG. The BBG was established as a buffer to protect VOA and other U.S.-sponsored, non-military, international broadcasters from political interference. It replaced the Board for International Broadcasting  BIB  that oversaw the funding and operation of [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty , a branch of VOA.<ref name=""Raghavan"">Raghavan, Sudarsan V., Stephen S.

Allen  as a directive in 1960 and was endorsed in 1962 by USIA director [[Edward R. Murrow . The principles were signed into law on July 12, 1976, by President [[Gerald Ford . It reads: <blockquote>The long-range interests of the United States are served by communicating directly with the peoples of the world by radio. To be effective, the Voice of America must win the attention and respect of listeners. These principles will therefore govern Voice of America  VOA  broadcasts. 1. VOA will serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news. VOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive. 2. VOA will represent America, not any single segment of American society, and will therefore present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions. 3. VOA will present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussions and opinion on these policies.<ref name=""VOA Charter"" /></blockquote>  ====""Two-source rule""==== According to former VOA correspondent Alan Heil, the internal policy of VOA News is that any story broadcast must have two independently corroborating sources or have a staff correspondent actually witness an event.  ==Newsroom== Voice of America's central newsroom has hundreds of journalists and dozens of full-time domestic and overseas correspondents, who are employees of the U.S. government or paid contractors. They are augmented by hundreds of contract correspondents and [[stringer  journalism |stringers  throughout the world, who file in English or in one of VOA's other radio and television broadcast languages.  In late 2005, VOA shifted some of its central-news operation to Hong Kong where contracted writers worked from a ""virtual"" office with counterparts on the overnight shift in Washington, D.C., but this operation was shut down in early 2008.  ==Shortwave frequencies== By December 2014, the number of transmitters and frequencies used by VOA had been greatly reduced. VOA still uses shortwave transmissions to cover some areas of Africa and Asia. Shortwave broadcasts still take place in these languages: Afaan Oromoo, Amharic, Bambara, Cantonese, Chinese, English, Indonesian, Korean and Swahili.  ==''VOA Radiogram''== [http://voaradiogram.net/ ''VOA Radiogram''] was an experimental Voice of America program starting in March 2013 which transmitted digital text and images via [[Shortwave radio|shortwave  [[Radiogram  message |radiograms . There were 220 editions of the program, transmitted each weekend from the Edward R. Murrow transmitting station. The audio tones that comprised the bulk of each 30 minute program were transmitted via an analog transmitter, and could be decoded using a basic [[Amplitude modulation|AM  [[shortwave receiver  with freely downloadable software of the [[Fldigi  family. This software is available for [[Windows , [[Apple Computers|Apple   [[OSX  , [[Linux , and [[FreeBSD  systems.  Broadcasts can also be decoded using the free [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Tivar&hl=en TIVAR app from the Google Play store] using any [[Android  operating system |Android  device.  The mode used most often on ''VOA Radiogram'', for both text and images, was MFSK32, but other modes were also occasionally transmitted.  The final edition of ''VOA Radiogram'' was transmitted during the weekend of June 17–18, 2017, a week before the retirement of the program producer from VOA. An offer to continue the broadcasts on a contract basis was declined, so a follow-on show called ''Shortwave Radiogram'' began transmission on June 25, 2017 from the [[WRMI  transmitting site in Okeechobee, Florida.  ;''Shortwave Radiogram'' program schedule {| class=""wikitable"" |- !

The site is now a recreational park with a lake, lodge, dog park, and Voice of America museum. The [[Voice of America Bethany Relay Station|Bethany Relay Station  operated from 1944 to 1994. Other former sites include California  [[Dixon, California|Dixon , [[Delano, California|Delano  , Hawaii, [[Okinawa ,  Monrovia  Liberia, Costa Rica, Belize, and at least two in Greece.  Between 1983 and 1990, VOA made significant upgrades to transmission facilities in Botswana, Morocco, Thailand, Kuwait, and Sao Tome.  Currently, VOA and the IBB continue to operate shortwave radio transmitters and antenna farms at [[International Broadcasting Bureau Greenville Transmitting Station  in the United States, close to [[Greenville, North Carolina , ""Site B.""  They do not use FCC-issued callsigns, since they are overseen by the [[NTIA , which is the Federal Government equivalent of the FCC  which regulates state government and public & private communications  and they operate under different rules. The IBB also operates a transmission facility on [[São Tomé  and  Tinang  [[Concepcion, Tarlac , Philippines for VOA.  <gallery widths=""250px"" perrow=""6""> File:VOA SiteB building.JPG|[[International Broadcasting Bureau Greenville Transmitting Station|Edward R.

State Department officials including [[Richard Armitage  politician |Richard Armitage  and others argued that the report amounted to giving terrorists a platform to express their views. In response, reporters and editors argued for the VOA's [[editorial independence  from its governors. VOA received praise from press organizations for its protests, and the following year in 2002, it won the University of Oregon's [[Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism .  ===Abdul Malik Rigi interview=== On April 2, 2007, [[Abdul Malik Rigi , the leader of [[Jundallah  Iran |Jundullah , a terrorist militant group with possible links to [[al-Qaeda , appeared on Voice of America's Persian service. VOA introduced Rigi as ""the leader of popular Iranian resistance movement."" The interview resulted in public condemnation by the [[Iranian-American  community, as well as the [[Iranian government .<ref name=""swissinfo.org""></ref> Jundullah is a [[Sunni  Islamist militant organization that has been linked to numerous attacks on civilians, such as the [[2009 Zahedan explosion .<ref name=""washt400killed""></ref>  ===Tibetan protester interview=== In February 2013, a documentary released by [[China Central Television  interviewed a [[self-immolation protests by Tibetans in China|Tibetan self-immolator  who failed to kill himself. The interviewee said he was motivated by Voice of America's broadcasts of commemorations of people who committed suicide in political self-immolation. VOA denied any allegations of instigating self-immolations and demanded that the Chinese station retract its report.  ===Trump presidency concerns=== After the [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration  of [[President of the United States|US President  [[Donald Trump , several tweets by Voice of America  one of which was later removed  seemed to support the widely criticized statements by White House press secretary [[Sean Spicer  about the crowd size and biased media coverage.

Trump sent two of his political aides, Matthew Ciepielowski and Matthew Schuck, to the agency to aid its current CEO during the [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition to the Trump administration . Criticism was raised over Trump's choice of aides; Schuck was a staff writer for [[Right-wing politics|right-wing  website ''The Daily Surge'' until April 2015, while Ciepielowski was a field director at the conservative advocacy group [[Americans for Prosperity .<ref name=TrumpTV/> VOA officials responded with assurances that they would not become ""Trump TV"".<ref name=TrumpTV/> BBG head John F. Lansing told [[NPR  that it would be illegal for the administration to tell VOA what to broadcast, while VOA director [[Amanda Bennett  stressed that while ""government-funded"", the agency is not ""government-run"".<ref name=megaphone/>  ===Guo Wengui interview=== On April 19, 2017, VOA interviewed the Chinese real estate tycoon [[Guo Wengui  in a live broadcast. The whole interview was scheduled for 3 hours. After Guo Weigui alleged to own evidence of corruption among the members of [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|the Politburo Standing Committee of China , the highest political authority of China, the interview was abruptly cut off, after only one hour and seventeen minutes of broadcasting. Guo's allegations involved Fu Zhenhua and Wang Qishan, the latter being a member of the Politburo Standing Committee and the leader of the massive anti-graft movement. It was reported that Beijing warned VOA's representatives not to interview Guo for his ""unsubstantiated allegations"". Four members of the U.S. Congress requested the [[Office of Inspector General  to conduct an investigation into this interruption on August 27, 2017.  ==See also== * [[International broadcasting  ** [[Alhurra  ** [[BBC World Service  ** [[France 24  ** [[Propaganda in the United States  ** [[State media  ** [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty  ** [[Radio Free Asia  ** [[Russia Today TV  ** [[Voice of America Indonesia  * VOA people ** [[Frank Shozo Baba  ** [[Willis Conover  ** [[George Kao   == References ==   ===Bibliography===  *  *    ==External links==  *  * [https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Voice+of+America%2C+a+U.S.+government+agency%22  Voice of America newscasts, science programs, editorials  Internet Archive ]      [[Category:Shortwave radio stations in the United States  [[Category:Peabody Award winners  [[Category:External services  broadcasting   [[Category:Radio organizations in the United States  [[Category:Organizations established in 1942  [[Category:Articles containing video clips  [[Category:United States government propaganda organizations  [[Category:Voice of America|   [[Category:Media companies based in Washington, D.C.

VOA produces digital, TV, and radio content in more than 40 languages which it distributes to affiliate stations around the globe. It is primarily viewed by foreign audiences, so VOA programming has an influence on public opinion abroad regarding the United States and its leaders.VOA was established in 1942, and the VOA charter  Public Laws 94-350 and 103-415  was signed into law in 1976 by President Gerald Ford. The charter contains its mission ""to broadcast accurate, balanced, and comprehensive news and information to an international audience"", and it defines the legally mandated standards in the VOA journalistic code.VOA is headquartered in Washington, DC and overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media, an independent agency of the U.S. government. Funds are appropriated annually by Congress under the budget for embassies and consulates. In 2016, VOA broadcast an estimated 1,800 hours of radio and TV programming each week to approximately 236.6 million people worldwide with about 1,050 employees and a taxpayer-funded annual budget of US$218.5 million.Some commentators consider Voice of America to be a form of propaganda. In response to the request of the United States Department of Justice that RT register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, Russia's Justice Ministry labeled Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty as foreign agents in December 2017."

''New Scientist'', based in London, publishes editions in the UK, the United States, and Australia. Since 1996 it has been available online.   Sold in retail outlets  paper edition  and on subscription  paper and/or online , the magazine covers news, features, reviews and commentary on science, technology and their implications. ''New Scientist'' also publishes speculative articles, ranging from the technical to the philosophical.  ==History== The magazine was founded in 1956 by [[Tom Margerison , [[Max Raison  and Nicholas Harrison<ref name=""Calder""></ref> as ''The New Scientist'', with Issue 1 on 22 November, priced one shilling  £0.05 as 20 shillings in the £; £ today . The British monthly science magazine ''Science Journal'', published 1965–71, was merged with ''New Scientist'' to form ''New Scientist and Science Journal''.   Originally, the cover of ''New Scientist'' listed articles in plain text. Initially, page numbering followed academic practice with sequential numbering for each quarterly volume. So, for example, the first page of an issue in March could be 649 instead of 1. Later issues numbered issues separately. From the beginning of 1961 ""''The''"" was dropped from the title.   From 1965, the front cover was illustrated. Until the 1970s, colour was not used except for on the cover. Since its first issue, ''New Scientist'' has written about the applications of science, through its coverage of technology. For example, the first issue included an article ""Where next from Calder Hall?"" on the future of nuclear power in the UK, a topic that it has covered throughout its history. In 1964 there was a regular ""Science in British Industry"" section with several items.<ref name=ns19640312>[https://books.google.com/books?id=c2iCzjpnd4EC&printsec=frontcover&rview=1#v=onepage&q&f=false ''New Scientist''], vol. 21, No. 382, 12 March 1964.</ref> An article in the magazine's 10th anniversary issues provides anecdotes on the founding of the magazine.<ref name=""Calder""/>  In 1970, the Reed Group, which went on to become [[Reed Elsevier , acquired ''New Scientist'' when it merged with [[International Publishing Corporation|IPC Magazines . Reed retained the magazine when it sold most of its consumer titles in a [[management buyout  to what is now [[TI Media .  Throughout most of its history, ''New Scientist'' has published cartoons as light relief and comment on the news, with contributions from regulars such as Mike Peyton and David Austin. The [[Grimbledon Down  comic strip, by cartoonist [[Bill Tidy , appeared from 1970 to 1994. The Ariadne pages in New Scientist commented on the lighter side of science and technology and included contributions from [[David E. H. Jones|Daedalus . The fictitious inventor devised plausible but impractical and humorous inventions, often developed by the  fictitious  DREADCO corporation. Daedalus later moved to ''[[Nature  journal |Nature ''. Issues of '' The  New Scientist'' from Issue 1 to the end of 1989 have been made free to read online. Subsequent issues require a subscription.  In the first half of 2013, the international circulation of New Scientist averaged 125,172. While this was a 4.3% reduction on the previous year's figure, it was a much smaller reduction in circulation than many mainstream magazines of similar or greater circulation. For the 2014 UK circulation fell by 3.2% but stronger international sales, increased the circulation to 129,585.<ref name=circulation></ref> See also [[#Website  below.  In April 2017, ''New Scientist'' changed hands when [[RELX Group , formerly known as Reed Elsevier, sold the magazine to Kingston Acquisitions, a group set up by Sir [[Bernard Gray , Louise Rogers and Matthew O’Sullivan to acquire ''New Scientist''.  Kingston Acquisitions then renamed itself New Scientist Ltd.  ===Modern format=== ''New Scientist'' currently contains the following sections: Leader, News  Upfront , Technology, Opinion  interviews, point-of-view articles and letters , Features  including cover article , CultureLab  book and event reviews , Feedback  humour , The Last Word  questions and answers  and Jobs & Careers. A [[Tom Gauld  cartoon appears on the Letters page. A readers' letters section discusses recent articles and discussions also take place on the website. Readers contribute observations on examples of [[pseudoscience  to Feedback, and offer questions and answers on scientific and technical topics to Last Word. New Scientist has produced a series of books compiled from contributions to Last Word.  There are 51 issues a year, with a Christmas and New Year double issue. The double issue in 2014 was the 3,000th edition of the magazine.  ==Staff and contributors== The Editor-in-chief is Emily Wilson, Executive Editor is Graham Lawton, Managing Editor is Rowan Hooper and Editor-at-Large is Jeremy Webb. <ref name=""NS310118""></ref> Consultants include [[Fred Pearce   environment , [[Marcus Chown   cosmology , and Linda Geddes  biomedicine .

The monthly magazine, published by Veen Media, is sold in the Netherlands and Belgium.  Since 2016 New Scientist has held an annual science festival in London. Styled ''New Scientist Live'', the event has attracted high-profile scientists and science presenters.  ==Criticism==  === Greg Egan's criticism of the EmDrive article === In September 2006, ''New Scientist'' was criticised by [[science fiction  writer [[Greg Egan , who wrote that ""a sensationalist bent and a lack of basic knowledge by its writers"" was making the magazine's coverage sufficiently unreliable ""to constitute a real threat to the public understanding of science"". In particular, Egan found himself ""gobsmacked by the level of scientific illiteracy"" in the magazine's coverage of Roger Shawyer's ""[[EmDrive|electromagnetic drive "", where ''New Scientist'' allowed the publication of ""meaningless double-talk"" designed to bypass a fatal objection to Shawyer's proposed space drive, namely that it violates the [[conservation of momentum|law of conservation of momentum . Egan urged others to write to ''New Scientist'' and pressure the magazine to raise its standards, instead of ""squandering the opportunity that the magazine's circulation and prestige provides"". The editor of ''New Scientist'', then Jeremy Webb, replied defending the article, saying that it is ""an ideas magazine—that means writing about hypotheses as well as theories"".  === ""Darwin was wrong"" cover === In January 2009, ''New Scientist'' ran a cover with the title ""[[Charles Darwin|Darwin  was wrong"".<ref name=scienceblogs>[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/21/new-scientist-flips-the-bird-a/ Pharyngula: New Scientist flips the bird at scientists, again]</ref> The actual story stated that specific details of Darwin's evolution theory had been shown incorrectly, mainly the shape of [[phylogenetic trees  of interrelated species, which should be represented as a web instead of a tree.

In some cases, reporters from both ProPublica and its partners work together on a story. ProPublica has partnered with more than 90 different news organizations, and it has won four Pulitzer Prizes.  == History == ProPublica was the brainchild of [[Herb Sandler|Herbert  and [[Marion Sandler , the former chief executives of the [[Golden West Financial Corporation , who have committed $10 million a year to the project.<ref name=""New York Times 15OCT07""></ref> The Sandlers hired [[Paul Steiger , former managing editor of the ''[[Wall Street Journal '', to create and run the organization as editor in chief. At the time ProPublica was set up, Steiger responded to concerns about the role of the political views of the Sandlers, saying on ''[[The Newshour with Jim Lehrer '':    ProPublica had an initial news staff of 28 reporters and editors, including [[Pulitzer Prize  winners [[Charles Ornstein , [[Tracy Weber , [[Jeff Gerth , and [[Marcus Stern  reporter |Marcus Stern , but has since grown to 34 full-time working journalists. Steiger claimed that he received as many as 850 applications upon ProPublica's start. The organization also appointed a 12-member journalism advisory board consisting of professional journalists.  The newsgroup shares its work under the [[Creative Commons  no-derivative, non-commercial license.  On August 5, 2015, [[Yelp  announced a partnership with the company to help improve their healthcare statistics.  == Funding == While the [[Sandler Foundation  provided ProPublica with significant financial support, it also has received funding from the [[Knight Foundation , [[MacArthur Foundation , [[Pew Charitable Trusts , [[Ford Foundation , [[the Carnegie Corporation , and the [[Atlantic Philanthropies . ProPublica and the Knight Foundation have various connections. For example, Paul Steiger, president of ProPublica, is a trustee of the Knight Foundation. In like manner, Alberto Ibarguen, the president and CEO of the Knight Foundation is on the board of ProPublica.  ProPublica has attracted attention for the salaries it pays its employees. In 2008, Paul Steiger, the editor of ProPublica, received a salary of $570,000.<ref name=""reuters1""></ref> Steiger was formerly the managing editor at ''[[The Wall Street Journal '', where his total compensation  including [[Employee stock option|options <ref name=""reuters1""/>  was double that at ProPublica. Steiger's stated strategy is to use a ''Wall Street Journal'' pay model to attract journalistic talent. In 2010, eight ProPublica employees made more than $160,000, including managing editor Stephen Engelberg  $343,463  and the highest-paid reporter, [[Dafna Linzer , formerly of the ''Washington Post''  $205,445 .

In May 2013, after widespread coverage of allegations that [[2013 IRS scandal|the IRS had inappropriately targeted conservative groups , ProPublica clarified that it obtained the documents through a [[Freedom of Information Act  United States |Freedom of Information Act  request, writing, ""In response to a request for the applications for 67 different nonprofits last November, the Cincinnati office of the IRS sent ProPublica applications or documentation for 31 groups. Nine of those applications had not yet been approved—meaning they were not supposed to be made public."" ProPublica reported on six of them, after deeming information within those applications to be newsworthy.<ref name=""IRSPP"">[https://www.propublica.org/article/irs-office-that-targeted-tea-party-also-disclosed-confidential-docs IRS Office That Targeted Tea Party Also Disclosed Confidential Docs From Conservative Groups], Kim Barker and Justin Elliott, ProPublica, May 13, 2013</ref>  ProPublica conducted a large-scale, circumscribed investigation on [[Psychiatric Solutions , a company based in Tennessee that buys failing hospitals, cuts staff, and accumulates profit.

Their report was published in conjunction with the ''[[Los Angeles Times ''.  === Documenting Hate ===  In 2017, ProPublica launched the [[Documenting Hate  project for systematic tracking of [[hate crime s and [[bias incident s.<ref name=Wang-2017-01-23> </ref> The project is part of their Civil Rights beat, and allows victims or witnesses of hate crime incidents to submit stories. The project also allows journalists and newsrooms to partner with ProPublica to write stories based on the dataset they are collecting. For example, the Minneapolis [[StarTribune  partnered with ProPublica to write about reporting of hate crimes in Minnesota.  === Surgeon Scorecard ===  In 2015, ProPublica launched Surgeon Scorecard, an interactive database that allows users to view complication rates for eight common elective procedures. The tool allows users to find surgeons and hospitals, and see their complication rates. The database was controversial, drawing criticism from doctors and prompting a critique from [[RAND . However, statisticians, including [[Andrew Gelman , stood behind their decision to attempt to shine light on an opaque aspect of the medical field, and ProPublica offered specific rebuttals to RAND's claims.  === Tracking Evictions and Rent Stabilization in NYC ===  This interactive map allows people to search for addresses in New York City, to see the effects of eviction cases.

Founded in 1992 as Citizens for Proportional Representation to support the implementation of proportional representation in American elections, the organization in 1993 became the Center for Voting and Democracy and in 2004 changed its name to FairVote to reflect its support of such platforms as [[instant-runoff voting|ranked choice voting   RCV , for single-winner elections, a national popular vote for president, a right to vote amendment to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution , and universal [[voter registration .  FairVote releases regular publications on the state of the U.S. electoral system, including ''Dubious Democracy'' and ''Monopoly Politics''.  Other projects, such as ''Representation 2020'' and ""Promote Our Vote"", aim for increased voter participation and equitable representation of women. The organization supports other groups that advocate alternative electoral practices, including FairVote Minnesota.  Notable members of FairVote's board of directors include [[Nirvana  band |Nirvana  bassist [[Krist Novoselic  and [[Hendrik Hertzberg , a White House speechwriter for Jimmy Carter and longtime senior editor at ''The New Yorker''. For many years the board's chair was former congressman and 1980 [[Independent politician|independent  presidential candidate [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson .  ==About==  ===Founding=== FairVote was founded as Citizens for Proportional Representation in 1992 in [[Cincinnati, Ohio , by a diverse group of scholars, grassroots activists, civic leaders, and politicians.  The result of a merger of several smaller groups promoting proportional representation reform into a single, nationalized advocacy group, it originally had co-founder [[Rob Richie|Robert Richie  as executive director, co-founder Matthew Cossolotto as president and third co-founder [[Steven Hill  author |Steven Hill  as western regional director based in Seattle and later San Francisco. John Anderson was head of its national advisory board and in 1992 published a ''New York Times'' commentary advocating RCV in presidential elections. The CPR ended its founding year operating in [[Alexandria, Virginia , with around 200 members.    ===History and timeline=== Since its founding, FairVote has expanded its reach and expressed its platforms to both the public and all levels of government through campaigns, blogs, newsletters, lobbying, interviews, amicus curiae briefs, and numerous media outlets. Notable events include:  *1992: [[Ted Berry , the first African-American mayor of Cincinnati, conducts a welcoming speech at the CPR opening convention. Berry was a firm supporter of proportional representation and fought in the 1980s and 1990s to reinstate the practice in Cincinnati after its repeal in 1957. *1993: Citizens for Proportional Representation changes its name to the Center for Voting and Democracy to reflect support of other reforms, such as RCV and universal voter registration. The Center for Voting and Democracy relocates to Washington, D.C. *1994: Robert Richie appears on national radio to explain a federal judge's ruling that cumulative voting be used to settle a voting rights case in ''Cane vs. Worcester County, M.D.'' The Center for Voting and Democracy releases the first ''Dubious Democracy'', its biannual report on the state of democracy in congressional elections. *1996: Steven Hill runs the first campaign for electoral system reform in the US for several decades, a voter initiative to pass preference voting  proportional representation  in San Francisco. The campaign loses, 54-46%, but sets the stage for future victories. *1997: The Center releases ''Monopoly Politics'', a report on the undemocratic elements of the single winner plurality system. The Center's news conference is filmed on C-SPAN, and Rob Richie's opinion appears in ''[[The New York Times ''. *1999: RCV for statewide elections passes in the New Mexico State Senate. *2002: Led by western regional director Steven Hill, San Francisco becomes the first major city to pass a voter initiative, 54-46%, to adopt RCV for certain citywide elections *2002: Steven Hill's book ''Fixing Elections: the Failure of American's Winner Take All Elections'' is published, making the case for electoral system reform in the United States. *2004: San Francisco becomes the first city since Ann Arbor, MI in 1975 to use RCV in public elections, after suing recalcitrant city officials to compel compliance with the law.  *2005: Arkansas institutes RCV for overseas military voters *2006: South Carolina institutes RCV for military and overseas voters and Oakland and Minneapolis pass it for city elections *2007: Maryland becomes the first state to pass the National Popular Vote plan for president *2010: Oakland, Berkeley and San Leandro, CA all use RCV for the first time to elect local offices.  *2012: Robert Richie writes for ''[[The Huffington Post '' supporting a national popular vote for president *2013: Robert Richie coauthors the fourth edition of ''[[Every Vote Equal '', a book explaining and supporting the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact  *2014: New York lawmakers pass a national popular vote bill that will award the state's electoral votes to the candidate who receives the majority of the popular vote *2015: FairVote co-hosts with the [[Washington College of Law  a ""Democracy Slam"" with NBC's [[Chuck Todd  and other leading journalists and professors, with its key reforms receiving high ratings. *2016: Maine becomes the first state to adopt RCV statewide.  FairVote is headquartered in [[Takoma Park, Maryland .  ===Mission=== The stated mission of FairVote is ""to make representative democracy fair, functional, and representative by developing the analysis and educational tools necessary for our reform partners to secure and sustain improvements to American elections.""  FairVote concentrates its efforts on electoral reform in the United States through research, education, outreach, and support of policies that foster equal representation and greater transparency within the electoral administration.  The organization's projects fall into three broad categories: fair access to participation, fair elections, and fair representation. To that end, it sponsors programs like the Democracy Secretary of State  SoS  Project, which scrutinizes practices obstructing the voting process while proposing solutions to hold electoral officials accountable for their actions. The Promote Our Vote project focuses on local ideas to spur participation.  Members of FairVote regularly write blogs, provide commentary in interviews, and offer internships for interested youth.  ==Public perception== '''General coverage'''  FairVote has been covered by many major news outlets, including ''[[The Washington Post '', ''[[The New York Times '', and [[NPR , which tend to call it a [[non-partisan|nonpartisan  [[voting rights  [[advocacy group . Other commonly used terms include: ""voting rights organization,"" ""election reform advocacy group,"" ""national reform organization,"" and ""election participation and reform group."" ''[[The Denver Post '' referred to the group as ""election-protection campaigners.""  '''Alleged liberal bias'''  FairVote has been accused of having a [[liberal bias . In a profile of FairVote co-founder Steven Hill written by Scott James of ''The New York Times,'' FairVote is referred to as a ""left-wing group"" whose members ""have relentlessly berated people who have raised concerns."" Other writers claim that many FairVote policies, such as RCV, are popular in ""liberal enclaves"" and supported by ""populist groups"" such as [[Common Cause , a liberal advocacy organization, and thus give the group a liberal tilt. Louis Jacobson, a writer for ''[[Roll Call '', argues that any group supporting the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact  will be perceived as liberal-leaning because of Democratic frustration with the Electoral College after the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential Election . But Rob Richie, FairVote's executive director, has said, ""[FairVote] is definitely not a Democratic [[stalking horse ."" In addition, FairVote points to John Anderson, who was president of the organization's first advisory board and a current member of the Board of Directors, who ran for President as an Independent in 1980. In fact, before Anderson ran for President, he was a Republican Congressman from Illinois.  ==Proposed reforms== Released in 2013, '''Reform 2020''' is a set of four goals that the group hopes to reach by 2020:  *[[Single Transferable Vote|Fair  [[Proportional Representation|Representation Voting  *[[Instant-runoff voting|Ranked Choice Voting  *[[Right to vote in the United States|Constitutional Right to Vote  *[[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact|National Popular Vote   ===Electoral procedure===  FairVote advocates the use of [[Instant-runoff voting|instant-runoff voting   IRV  in single-winner elections. Under this system, voters rank candidates in order of preference, in contrast to the more widely used [[plurality voting  system. This is also called ""ranked-choice voting""  RCV , though many other [[Ranked voting|voting methods use ranked-choice ballots .  In 2002, FairVote backed a [[San Francisco  ballot initiative amending Section 13.102 of the city charter to allow RCV in local elections.<ref name=""sfrcv.com|accessdate=20""></ref> The city began using RCV to elect local officials on November 2, 2004.<ref name=""sfrcv.com|accessdate=20""/> Subsequent ballot initiatives supported by FairVote have allowed the use of RCV in the following cities  listed with first year of use :  *[[Takoma Park, Maryland   2007  *[[Minneapolis, Minnesota   2009  *[[Oakland, California , Berkeley and San Leandro  2010  *[[Portland, Maine   2010  *[[San Leandro, California   2010  *[[St. Paul, Minnesota   2011  *[[Springfield, Illinois   2011  *[[Telluride, Colorado   2011  *[[Memphis, Tennessee   not yet implemented  *[[Santa Fe, New Mexico   2018   FairVote supports modification of state laws governing the [[Electoral College  United States |Electoral College  so that the president is elected by national popular vote. FairVote advocates the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact , an agreement among states and the [[District of Columbia  to award their [[electoral vote s to the candidate with the highest [[Direct election|popular vote  total in all 50 states and DC. FairVote has played an active role in lobbying state officials to join the compact. New York Assemblyman [[Fred Thiele  said he first proposed New York's entrance into the compact after being approached by FairVote.  FairVote advocates the use of [[proportional representation   which they call ""fair representation voting""  in multi-seat assembly and council elections throughout the United States. In this system, each candidate or party controls a share of seats equal to its share of the vote. The organization has proposed combining several congressional districts into one to allow for proportional representation in the [[United States Congress , as well as in the California and Michigan state assemblies. They advocate for several PR systems, including [[Single transferable vote|STV   which they ''also'' call ""Ranked Choice Voting"" , [[Cumulative voting|cumulative voting ,<ref name="":0""></ref> unordered [[Open list|open list   ""Open Ticket Voting"" , [[Single non-transferable vote|SNTV   ""Single-Vote Method"" ,<ref name="":0"" /> and [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP   ""Districts Plus"" .  ===Voting rights===  FairVote has backed the proposed Right to Vote Amendment  [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hjres44 House Joint Resolution 44] , sponsored by Representatives [[Mark Pocan   D-WI  and [[Keith Ellison   D-MN , under which citizens would be guaranteed a [[constitutional right  to vote. FairVote filed a policy brief in support of the legislation, stating, ""We believe that the right to vote is a cornerstone of representative democracy that depends upon broadly defined voter eligibility, universal voter access to the polls, and election integrity."" FairVote has also advocated universal voter registration, a system in which all citizens of legal [[voting age  would be registered to vote automatically.  ==Research and reports==  ===Election research=== FairVote has conducted research on both presidential and Congressional elections. Most of its presidential election research focuses on the [[electoral college 's effects on campaigning. In its [[2012 Presidential election  United States |2012 Presidential Election  analysis, FairVote documented the large disparity in both time and money spent in [[swing states   e.g., [[Florida   versus [[safe state s  e.g., [[Maryland  .<ref name=""Carroll 114""></ref> In addition, FairVote has begun publishing data on how much time sitting presidents spend in swing states.  FairVote releases two main documents of Congressional research every election cycle. The first is ""Monopoly Politics"", which contains predictions and analysis for each race. FairVote first categorizes each seat according to its competitiveness; seats are labeled Safe Democratic, Likely Democratic, Lean Democratic, Toss Up, Lean Republican, Likely Republican, or Safe Republican.<ref name=""Carroll 114""/> Relatedly, FairVote gives each district a [[partisanship  ranking derived from previous elections. FairVote then predicts what percentage of the vote candidates will receive. Lastly, the research tries to predict [[incumbent  winning percentages for the election cycle. For example, FairVote expects incumbents to do 4.5% better in 2014 than they did in 2012.  The second major document is ""Dubious Democracy"", an assessment of Congressional elections' fairness. By aggregating Congressional race data since 1982, the research attempts to highlight several elements of Congressional elections&nbsp;— the ratio of competitive to noncompetitive districts, the effects of [[gerrymandering , and [[voter turnout &nbsp;— that FairVote believes hurt the democratic process. In the report, every Congressional race is placed on a scale of competitiveness, from Tight  <5% margin of victory  to No Contest  >40% margin of victory , and the percentage of races within each category is tracked over time. In addition, the research tracks voter turnout and [[wasted vote s over time. Lastly, the report follows the success of incumbents in winning reelection over time.  In addition to Monopoly Politics and Dubious Democracy, after the [[2010 midterm elections  FairVote released data on the effect of [[Third party  politics |third-party  and [[spoiler candidate s. The report found that there were many districts in which the winning candidate did not receive a majority of the vote, a fact the group finds problematic. In addition, the research highlighted races in which [[Independent  politician |Independents  garnered a sizable percentage of the vote.  Finally, FairVote created Representation 2020, a project that hopes to achieve parity in the numbers of men and women serving in elected office. The project has three main goals: institutionalizing changes in party rules to recruit and train more women to run for office, creating family-friendly legislative schedules, and replacing single-member districts with multi-member districts with proportional representation.  ===Voting rights===  FairVote has created two projects that aim to expand and protect voting rights in the United States. The first, Promote Our Vote, tries to provide support and resources for groups focused on expanding [[voting rights . The group provides electoral research, legal analysis, and communications assistance. In addition, Promote Our Vote creates support for a constitutional right to vote amendment by building up support at the local level, focusing mainly on college campuses.  The second project is Democracy SoS, which aims to familiarize voters with the important role of state-level [[Secretary of State  U.S. state government |Secretary of State  officials. To that end, the project has issued reports on state election preparedness, interviewed state election officials, and published voter guides that focus on [[election reform  policies. The project also hopes to popularize its candidate surveys, which include questions about election planning and election integrity.  ==Involvement in court cases== FairVote has participated in a number of recent court cases as [[amici curiae  to advance fair representation voting, particularly under the California and federal Voting Rights Act.<ref name=""FairVote""></ref> Notable recent cases in which they have been involved include:  ===''Sanchez v. City of Modesto''  2007 === [[California voting rights act#Sanchez v. The City of Modesto|''Sanchez v. City of Modesto''   2007  dealt with the constitutionality of the [[California Voting Rights Act  of 2001  CVRA .<ref name=""Sanchez v. City of Modesto""></ref>  After the California Superior Court of Stanislaus County declared the CVRA unconstitutional in favor of the City of [[Modesto, California|Modesto , plaintiffs Enrique Sanchez, Emma Pinedo and Salvador Vera appealed to the Fifth Appellate District of the Court of Appeal of California.<ref name=""Sanchez v. City of Modesto""/>  Along with Kathay Feng from the organization California [[Common Cause , FairVote submitted an amicus curiae brief in favor of the plaintiffs.  FairVote argued that winner-take-all at-large voting systems caused ""vote dilutions in jurisdictions affected by racially polarized voting, even where minority voters cannot form a majority in a single member district.""  Supporting the CVRA, FairVote viewed the law requiring courts to ""fashion effective remedies to cure vote dilution affecting smaller and dispersed minority populations.""  Asserting that the CVRA allows California to become more representative of the people, FairVote concluded that the CVRA was an important and constitutional piece of government reform.  The Court of Appeal applied [[rational basis review  to CVRA and declared the law constitutional, reversing the lower court's decision.<ref name=""Sanchez v. City of Modesto""/>  ===''United States v. Village of Port Chester''  2008 ===  In December 2006, the [[United States Department of Justice  alleged that [[Port Chester 's at-large system of electing its board of trustees violated Section 2 of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965 . The US government claimed that the at-large electoral system denied the Hispanic population ""an equal opportunity to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.""<ref name=""LexisNexis Academic""></ref>  In ''United States v. Village of Port Chester''  2008 , US District Judge Stephen Robinson of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a decision that the Village's election system violated the Voting Rights Act and ordered remedial plans from all parties.<ref name=""LexisNexis Academic""/>  The Defendants of the case, the Village of Port Chester, proposed cumulative voting as a remedy, which ""allows citizens to cast multiple votes for a given candidate for a given seat.""<ref name=""Brennan Center for Justice""></ref>  In 2007, the Brennan Center, representing FairVote as amicus curiae, submitted a brief supporting cumulative voting as a remedy, but also proposing another system known as ""choice voting"", a process of ranking candidates.<ref name=""Brennan Center for Justice""/> FairVote argued that ""cumulative and choice voting avoid the necessity for deliberately drawing districts along racial lines"" and that a winner-take-all system would not allow the Hispanic minority population to gain representation.  FairVote also argued that cumulative voting is appropriate under the Voting Rights Act, as it ""ensures the equal principle of ""one-person, one vote"""", is race-neutral, and that it is supported by case law and history. On November 6, 2009, the Court did not accept choice voting but accepted Port Chester's remedy of cumulative voting. On June 16, 2010, Port Chester elected its first Latino to the Board of Trustees.<ref name=""Brennan Center for Justice""/>  ===''Minnesota Voters Alliance v. City of Minneapolis''  2009 ===  FairVote Minnesota is an independent ally of FairVote.  FairVote Minnesota, siding with the [[City of Minneapolis , served as intervenor-respondent in ''Minnesota Voters Alliance v. City of Minneapolis'', a case that was attested at the [[Minnesota Supreme Court .  ''Minnesota Voters Alliance v. City of Minneapolis'' dealt with the constitutionality of RCV, which was adopted by the City of Minneapolis for its municipal elections.<ref name=""Minnesota Supreme Court""></ref>  Minnesota Voters Alliance, a non-profit organization who served as the appellants, argued that the ""method violates their right to vote, to associate for political purposes, and to equal protection under both the United States and the Minnesota Constitutions"".  Siding with the city, FairVote Minnesota stated that instant-runoff voting  IRV  is a form of RCV that allowed voters to rank multiple candidates on a single ballot. They argued that this form of voting had legitimate policy reasons such as simplifying the election process, saving money, increasing voter turn-out, ensuring more diverse representation, and promoting civil election campaigns.  In their defense of the City of Minneapolis, FairVote argued that the appellants bore a """"heavy burden of persuasion"" because they brought a facial challenge to the constitutionality of IRV"" and that ""Minneapolis IRV is constitutional because it is supported by legitimate interests, imposes no burden on the right to vote, and applies to all voters"".  The Court affirmed the lower district court's ruling that RCV did not infringe on the appellants' constitutional rights, thus rejecting the Minnesota Voters Alliance's challenge to RCV.<ref name=""Minnesota Supreme Court""/> After the result, Jeanne Massey, executive director of FairVote Minnesota, applauded the Minnesota Supreme Court decision and stated that the Court ""blazed a path that every community in our state can follow toward better elections and a stronger democracy"" and that the decision was ""a resounding endorsement of ranked choice voting"".  ===''Jauregi v. City of Palmdale''  2014 ===  Juan Jauregui, the plaintiff, filed a complaint in April 2012 alleging that [[Palmdale 's at-large method of electing members to its City Council resulted in vote dilution for Latino and African American residents.<ref name=""GlobeNewswire""></ref>  The lawsuit claimed that Palmdale's at-large method denied minority residents effective political participation and thus violated the California Voting Rights Act  CVRA .<ref name=""GlobeNewswire""/> The case was brought up to Judge Mooney of the Superior Court of the State of California in the County of Los Angeles.  In July 2013, Judge Mooney declared that the CVRA vested the court in implementing appropriate remedies in favor of the plaintiffs.  The City of Palmdale immediately appealed the decision, reasoning that in 2001 Palmdale residents voted for an at-large election system. The case reached the California Court of Appeal in the Second Appellate District.  On January 2014, FairVote submitted an amicus curiae brief in support of the plaintiffs.  FairVote argued that fair representation voting, unlike at-large systems, enhanced minority groups to elect at least one candidate of their choice. FairVote advocated for a number of alternative methods, such as ranked choice voting, single voting, and cumulative voting.  However, the City of Palmdale opposed FairVote's participation, arguing that the amicus brief ""threatens significant prejudice to the City"" as it would continue to delay the certification of the City's November 2013 election. The California Court of Appeal has denied FairVote's application to file as amicus curiae.<ref name=""FairVote""/>  ==References==   [[Category:Electoral reform in the United States  [[Category:Non-profit organizations based in Maryland  [[Category:Organizations established in 1992  [[Category:Electoral reform groups ","FairVote  formerly the Center for Voting and Democracy  is a 501 c  3  organization that advocates electoral reform in the United States.Founded in 1992 as Citizens for Proportional Representation to support the implementation of proportional representation in American elections, the organization in 1993 became the Center for Voting and Democracy and in 2004 changed its name to FairVote to reflect its support of such platforms as ranked choice voting  RCV , for single-winner elections, a national popular vote for president, a right to vote amendment to the Constitution, and universal voter registration.FairVote releases regular publications on the state of the U.S. electoral system, including Dubious Democracy and Monopoly Politics.Other projects, such as Representation 2020 and ""Promote Our Vote"", aim for increased voter participation and equitable representation of women.

[[File:The Arizona Republic  2012-08-13 .svg|Former logo|thumb   ==History==  ===Early years=== The newspaper was founded May 19, 1890, under the name '''''The Arizona Republican'''''.<ref name=""Gannett profile""></ref>  [[Dwight B. Heard , a Phoenix land and cattle baron, ran the newspaper from 1912 until his death in 1929. The paper was then run by two of its top executives, Charles Stauffer and W. Wesley Knorpp, until it was bought by Midwestern newspaper magnate [[Eugene C. Pulliam  in 1946. Stauffer and Knorpp had changed the newspaper's name to ''The Arizona Republic'' in 1930, and also had bought the rival ''[[Phoenix Gazette|Phoenix Evening Gazette '' and ''Phoenix Weekly Gazette'', later known, respectively, as ''The Phoenix Gazette'' and the ''Arizona Business Gazette''.  ===Pulliam era=== Pulliam, who bought the two ''Gazettes'' as well as the ''Republic'', ran all three newspapers until his death in 1975 at the age of 86. A strong period of growth came under Pulliam, who imprinted the newspaper with his conservative brand of politics and his drive for civic leadership. Pulliam was considered one of the influential business leaders who created the modern Phoenix area as it is known today.  Pulliam's holding company, Central Newspapers, Inc., as led by Pulliam's widow and son, assumed operation of the Republic/Gazette family of papers upon the elder Pulliam's death. ''The Phoenix Gazette'' was closed in 1997 and its staff merged with that of the ''Republic''. The ''Arizona Business Gazette'' is still published to this day.  In 1998, a weekly section geared towards [[college  students, ""[[The Rep "", went into circulation. Specialized content is also available in the local sections produced for many of the different cities and suburbs that make up the Phoenix metropolitan area.  ===Gannett purchase=== Central Newspapers was purchased by Gannett in 2000, bringing it into common ownership with ''[[USA Today '' and the local Phoenix [[NBC  television affiliate, [[KPNX . The ''Republic'' and KPNX combine their forces to produce their common local news subscription website, [http://www.azcentral.com www.azcentral.com]. In 2013, it dropped from the sixteenth daily newspaper in the United States to the twenty-first, by circulation.<ref name=""top 100 daily""></ref>  On September 25, 2015, Mi-Ai Parrish was named Publisher and President of both the paper and its AZCentral.com website, effective October 12.<ref name=""Mi-Ai Parrish is named publisher of The Arizona Republic""></ref>  ==Staff==  Notable figures include [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer-prize  winning cartoonist [[Steve Benson  cartoonist |Steve Benson , columnist Laurie Roberts, and Luis Manuel Ortiz, the only Hispanic member of the Arizona Journalism Hall of Fame. One of Arizona's best-known sports writers, [[Norm Frauenheim , retired in 2008. Multiple staff members have been finalists for the Pulitzer Prize. Other staff include photojournalist [[Michael Schennum .  ===Don Bolles murder=== An investigative reporter for the newspaper, [[Don Bolles , was the victim of a car bombing on June 2, 1976, dying eleven days afterward. He had been lured to a meeting in Phoenix in the course of work on a story about corruption in local politics and business and the bomb detonated as he started his car to leave. Retaliation against his pursuit of organized crime in Arizona is thought to be a motive in the murder.  == Political endorsements ==  Historically, ''The Republic'' has tilted conservative editorially.  It endorsed President [[George W. Bush  in both the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000  and [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential elections . On October 25, 2008, the paper endorsed Arizona Senator [[John McCain  for president.<ref name=""McCain Endorement""></ref>  In local elections, it has recently endorsed Democratic candidates such as former Arizona Governor, former Secretary of Homeland Security, and now President of the [[University of California  [[Janet Napolitano  and former Arizona Congressman [[Harry Mitchell .    On September 27, 2016, the paper endorsed [[Hillary Clinton  for the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election , marking the first time in the paper's 126-year history that it had endorsed a Democratic candidate for president.  Previously, the paper had only withheld its endorsement from a Republican nominee/candidate twice in its history.  During the unusual sequence of events that led up to the [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912 presidential election  the paper had opted not to endorse the ""formal"" Republican party nominee for that election cycle.  This was shortly after [[Theodore Roosevelt  had lost the Republican convention nomination to [[William Howard Taft  in the controversial, and allegedly rigged, party convention of that year.  After Roosevelt's convention loss, and also after the hasty formation of the ""made to order"" [[Bull Moose Party , the paper continued to endorse Theodore Roosevelt via the newly formed party.  As a result of Roosevelt's insistence on an independent presidential bid that year, the Republican party of 1912 was in disarray, yielding that year's presidential election to the Democrats, with the GOP only able to carry a total of 8 electoral votes that year.  Two of the main planks of Roosevelt's progressive Bull Moose platform had been [[campaign finance reform  and improved [[Open government|governmental accountability .  In the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential election , the paper declined to endorse either [[Richard Nixon  or [[Hubert Humphrey , asserting that ""all candidates are good candidates.""  In the paper's 2016 editorial decision to take the further step of actually endorsing a Democratic candidate for the first time, the paper argued that despite Clinton's flaws, it could not support Republican nominee [[Donald Trump , denouncing him as ""not conservative"" and ""not qualified."" The board also argued that Trump had ""deep character flaws....  and  ... stunning lack of human decency, empathy and respect,"" suggesting that it was evidence he ""doesn't grasp our national ideals.""  The paper also noted its concern regarding whether or not Trump would possess the necessary restraint needed for someone with access to nuclear weapons, stating, ""The president commands our nuclear arsenal. Trump can’t command his own rhetoric.""<ref name=""wp-arizonarephillary""></ref><ref name=""arizona-republic-direct-link"">[http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2016/09/27/hillary-clinton-endorsement/91198668/ Endorsement: Hillary Clinton is the only choice....] Arizona Republic newspaper.

The publication, sometimes called '''''IBTimes''''' or '''''IBT''''', offers news, opinion and editorial commentary on business and commerce. IBT is one of the world's largest online news sources, receiving forty million unique visitors each month.<ref name=Dooley /> Its 2013 revenues were around $21 million.  ''IBTimes'' was launched in 2005; it is owned by IBT Media, which separated from [[Newsweek Media Group|Newsweek  in 2018, and was founded by Etienne Uzac and Johnathan Davis. Its headquarters are in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District  of [[Lower Manhattan , [[New York City .<ref name=juju></ref>  ==History== [[File:Ibtfxdrawing.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A hand-drawn blueprint, created in 2007 by Davis, outlining what would become the [[IBTimes  FX editor   Founder Etienne Uzac, a native of France, came up with the idea for the global business news site while a student at the [[London School of Economics . He found that the strongest business newspapers had a focus on the United States and Europe and planned to provide broader geographic coverage. Uzac recruited Johnathan Davis to join him in the enterprise. In late 2005, Uzac and Davis moved to [[New York City  to launch the site, with Uzac primarily focused on business strategy, while Davis coded the site and wrote the first articles.  In May 2012, the company announced the appointment of [[Jeffery Rothfeder  as [[editor-in-chief  and the promotion of Davis from [[executive editor  to [[chief content officer .  On August 4, 2013, [[Newsweek Media Group|IBT Media  announced its purchase of ''[[Newsweek '' and the domain newsweek.com from [[IAC  company |IAC/InterActiveCorp . The purchase did not include ''[[The Daily Beast ''. [[Peter S. Goodman , previously executive business editor and [[global news  editor of ''[[The Huffington Post '', became editor in 2014.<ref name=nytimes></ref> IBT Media later rebranded as '''Newsweek Media Group'''.  From March to July 2016, IBT laid off an estimated thirty percent of its editorial staff. This period marked a new era for the company as it expanded into branded content and events with its sister publication ''[[Newsweek ''. At the same time, [[Dev Pragad , who had started the [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa   EMEA  business in 2009, was promoted from [[managing director  of Europe to global CEO of ''Newsweek'' and IBT. This was followed in January 2017 by the appointment of [[Alan Press  in the ""newly-created, strategic role of President"".  In September 2018, Newsweek Media Group once again became IBT Media with ''Newsweek'' spun off as an independent company.  ==Content quality== In late 2011, Google allegedly moved the outlet's articles down in search results in response to excessive [[search engine optimization  activity. An internal ''IBT'' memo allegedly advised ''IBT'' journalists on how to ""re-work a story you've already done and re-post it in the hopes that it will chart better via Google... Some people have been just re-posting the exact same story, with a new headline. We're not doing that anymore.""<ref name=guardian_unconventional />  Reporting in 2014, ''[[Mother Jones  magazine |Mother Jones '' claimed that IBT journalists are subject to constant demand to produce [[clickbait ; one former employee reportedly complained that management issued ""impossible"" demands, including a minimum of 10,000 hits per article, and fired those who couldn't deliver. Of 432 articles published by ''IBT Japan'' in a certain time interval, 302 were reportedly created by copying sentences from Japanese media and combining them, ""collage-style"", to create stories that seemed new; ''IBT Japan'' apologized for the behavior and blamed it on a contract employee.<ref name=Dooley /> Similarly, employees told ''[[The Guardian '' in 2014 that at times they seemed to operate more as ""content farms"" demanding high-volume output than a source of quality journalism. At least two journalists were allegedly threatened with firing unless traffic to their articles increased sharply.<ref name=guardian_unconventional />  In 2016, ''IBT'' hired [[John Crowley  journalist |John Crowley , the [[The Wall Street Journal|''Wall Street Journal''<nowiki/>'s  EMEA digital editor, as its UK editor-in-chief. According to ''[[The Guardian '', ""Crowley said his focus would be on helping the site break exclusives, in-depth storytelling and new forms of digital journalism. He said ''IBT'' was putting together a UK business desk and hiring an audience team."" Crowley stated, ""We are not a [[wire service  or so-called [[paper of record ... but I have a vision of where I want to take a site... we've got to have a USP  unique selling proposition ... make ourselves distinctive in journalistic terms."" The standard of content on IBTimes.co.uk has notably improved in recent years with reputable papers such as ''[[The Times '' quoting exclusive content from the publication. Sports and entertainment coverage often gets pick up in the British press and on the [[BBC .  In early 2017, ''International Business Times'' UK joined a partnership along with the likes of [[Bloomberg News|''Bloomberg'' , [[Channel 4 News|''Channel 4''  and the [[BBC News|BBC  to work together to combat the spread of [[fake news . In June 2017, Jason Murdock — who covers [[cybersecurity  for the ''International Business Times UK'' — won Digital Writer of the year at the Drum Online Media Awards, which according to InPublishing magazine “identify the cleverest, boldest and most original purveyors of news and views from around the world.”  [[Media Matters for America , a [[progressivism|politically progressive  journalism watchdog, labeled an ''IBT'' article linking [[Hillary Clinton 's policies to the gun used in the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting  a ""false and sloppy smear"" that was based on a misreading of government documents.  In the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review '', contributing editor [[Trudy Lieberman  credited ''IBT''s [[David Sirota 's investigative reporting for helping to drive a call for reform in Connecticut health insurance regulation.  ==Labor relations== Early in its history, IBT Media allegedly employed immigrant students of [[Olivet University  who were not authorized to work in the United States to translate English content into [[Chinese language|Chinese  and other languages, paying them less than [[minimum wage  to do so.<ref name=Dooley></ref> In 2016, employees complained publicly about missed payroll, meager or nonexistent [[severance package s, and one-sided [[nondisclosure agreement s.  ==Relationship to ""The Community""== The nature of the connection between IBT and The Community, a Christian sect led by [[David Jang , is disputed; IBT states that many reports about its connections to The Community are false or exaggerated.<ref name=Dooley />  Davis and Uzac both have ties to [[Olivet University , an evangelical institution founded by  Jang. Graduates of Olivet are known to work at Newsweek Media Group, which has donated money to Olivet. Davis was formerly on faculty at Olivet, where his wife serves as university president. Uzac has served on the Olivet [[board of trustees ; his wife has worked as [[press secretary  for the [[World Evangelical Alliance , of which Olivet is a member. Davis has personally endorsed the view that [[homosexuality  can be caused by childhood [[sexual abuse  and cured by [[conversion therapy|therapy , although he declines to elaborate on his [[homosexuality and religion|religious views  regarding homosexuality, stating that he separates his work from his faith.<ref name=guardian_unconventional></ref>  ''[[Christianity Today '' claimed in 2012 that it had obtained an email in which Davis stated that he could not join a certain Jang-affiliated organization because his ""commission is inherently covert"". Davis denied the claim.<ref name=guardian_unconventional /> According to ''[[Business Insider '', Jang's concept of journalism may involve infusing the ""[[Gospel message "" into media.  ==References==   ==External links== *   [[Category:American business newspapers  [[Category:Digital newspapers published in the United States  [[Category:Economics websites  [[Category:Organizations based in New York City  [[Category:Internet properties established in 2005  [[Category:IBT Media  [[Category:2005 establishments in New York City ","The International Business Times is an American online news publication that publishes seven national editions in four languages.

In 1933, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs managed to appoint [[Hitoshi Ashida , former Ministry official, as chief editor.   During World War II, the newspaper served as an outlet for Imperial Japanese government propaganda and editorial opinion.  The paper's circulation at that time was about 825,000.<ref name=""Kamiya"" /> It was successively renamed '''''The Japan Times and Mail'''''  1918–1940  following its merger with ''The Japan Mail'', '''''The Japan Times and Advertiser'''''  1940–1943  following its merger with ''The Japan Advertiser'', and '''''Nippon Times'''''  1943–1956  before reverting to the ''Japan Times'' title in 1956. The temporary change to ''Nippon Times'' occurred during ban of English language sentiment during World War II era Japan.   Shintaro Fukushima  [[:ja:1907年|1907年 - [[:ja:1987年|1987   became the president in 1956. He exchanged each company's  stock with Toshiaki Ogasawara   小笠原 敏晶 ''Ogasawara Toshiaki'' . After Fukushima renounced managing rights, Ogasawara's company Nifco, a manufacturer of automotive fasteners, acquired control of ''The Japan Times'' in 1983 and changed all of former staffs and company's tradition established in 1897.<ref name="":0""></ref> Nifco chairman Toshiaki Ogasawara also served as the chairman and publisher of ''The Japan Times'' until 2016. His daughter Yukiko Ogasawara  小笠原 有輝子 ''Ogasawara Yukiko''  was president of the company from 2006 to 2012, when she was replaced by career ''Japan Times'' staffer Takeharu Tsutsumi. Yukiko succeeded her father as chairman of the company in 2016. Nifco sold ''The Japan Times'' to News2u Holdings, Inc. on June 30, 2017.   After being sold to the ""PR company"" News2u, the ''Japan Times'' changed its editorial stance and contributor lineup as part of efforts to reduce criticism of the paper as an ""anti-Japanese"" outlet.<ref name=reuters2019></ref> In November 2018, the newspaper announced in an editor's note that it would replace the term ""forced labor"" with ""wartime laborers"", and the term ""[[comfort women "" with ""women who worked in wartime brothels, including those who did so against their will, to provide sex to Japanese soldiers"", in its subsequent articles.<ref name=jtterms></ref> The change drew immediate criticism from readers and employees, with particular concerns expressed over the paper's apparent alignment with the political positions of Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe .<ref name=guardianterms></ref>  ==Content==  ===Print=== The Japan Times, Inc. publishes three periodicals: ''The Japan Times'', an English-language daily [[broadsheet ; ''The Japan Times Weekly'', an English-language weekly in tabloid form; and ''Shukan ST'', a weekly in tabloid format, targeted at Japanese learning English.

Discuss on talk page first --> news and entertainment company with a focus on [[digital media ; it is based in New York City. BuzzFeed was founded in 2006 by [[Jonah Peretti  and John S. Johnson III, to focus on tracking viral content. [[Kenneth Lerer , co-founder and [[chairman  of ''[[The Huffington Post '', started as a co-founder and investor in BuzzFeed and is now the [[executive chairman .  Originally known for online quizzes, ""[[listicle s"", and pop culture articles, the company has grown into a global media and technology company, providing coverage on a variety of topics including politics, [[DIY , animals, and business.<ref name=""LaFrance&Meyer-Atlantic""></ref> In late 2011, BuzzFeed hired [[Ben Smith  journalist |Ben Smith  of ''[[Politico '' as editor-in-chief, to expand the site into serious journalism, [[long-form journalism , and reportage. After years of investment in investigative journalism, by 2018 ''[[BuzzFeed News '' had won the [[National Magazine Awards|National Magazine Award <ref name="":1"" /> and the [[George Polk Awards|George Polk Award ,<ref name="":2""></ref> and been a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize <ref name="":1"" /><ref name="":3""></ref> and the [[Michael Kelly Award .<ref name="":1"" />  Despite BuzzFeed's entrance into serious journalism, a 2014 [[Pew Research Center  survey found that in the United States, BuzzFeed was viewed as an unreliable source by the majority of respondents, regardless of age or political affiliation. ''BuzzFeed News'' has since moved to its own domain rather than exist as a section of the main BuzzFeed website.  ==History== [[File:Jonah-peretti.jpg|thumb|[[Jonah Peretti  founded BuzzFeed in November 2006.   Prior to establishing BuzzFeed, Peretti was director of [[research and development  and the OpenLab at [[Eyebeam  organization |Eyebeam , Johnson's New York City-based art and technology nonprofit, where he experimented with other viral media.  In 2006, while working at the ''Huffington Post'', Peretti started BuzzFeed  originally called BuzzFeed Laboratories  as a side project, in partnership with his former supervisor John Johnson. In the beginning, BuzzFeed employed no writers or editors, just an ""algorithm to cull stories from around the web that were showing stirrings of virality."" The site initially launched an instant messaging client, BuzzBot, which sent users a link to popular content. The messages were sent based on algorithms which examined the links that were being quickly disseminated, scouring through the feeds of hundreds of blogs that were aggregating them<!-- Citation needed -->. Later, the site began spotlighting the most popular links that BuzzBot found. Peretti hired curators to help describe the content that was popular around the web.<ref name=""insidebuzzfeed""/> In 2011, Peretti hired ''[[Politico '''s Ben Smith, who earlier had achieved much attention as a political blogger, to assemble a news operation in addition to the many aggregated ""listicles"".  In 2016, BuzzFeed formally separated its news and entertainment content into ''BuzzFeed News'' and the newly formed BuzzFeed Entertainment Group, which also includes BuzzFeed Motion Pictures. , BuzzFeed had correspondents from 12 countries,<ref name=""Robischon-FC-Quest""></ref> and foreign editions in Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Spain, and the United Kingdom.  BuzzFeed employed around 1,700 employees worldwide, although it announced plans in November of that year to lay off around 100 employees in the US, 45 in the UK,<ref name=""AP-layoff""/> and 100 in France in June 2018.  On January 23, 2019, BuzzFeed notified all employees via memo that there would be an upcoming 15% reduction in workforce affecting the international, web content, and news divisions of the company. The layoffs would affect approximately 200 employees.  ===Funding===  In 2011, BuzzFeed ran more than 100 Campaigns, resulting in triple revenue from 2010<ref name="":0""></ref>.  By February 2012, BuzzFeed raised $15.5 million<ref name="":0"" /> the few months before through social-advertising campaigns.    In October 2012, BuzzFeed started running ads for the Obama campaign. This led to a huge boost in their advertising content and revenue.  In August 2014, BuzzFeed raised $50 million from the [[venture capital  firm [[Andreessen Horowitz , more than doubling previous rounds of funding.<ref name=""CNN""></ref> The site was reportedly valued at around $850 million by Andreessen Horowitz.<ref name=""CNN"" /> BuzzFeed generates its advertising revenue through [[native advertising  that matches its editorial content, and does not rely on banner ads.<ref name=""insidebuzzfeed""></ref> BuzzFeed also uses its familiarity with social media to target conventional advertising through other channels, such as Facebook.<ref name=""fastcompany"" />  In December 2014, growth equity firm [[General Atlantic  acquired $50 million in secondary stock of the company.  In August 2015, [[NBCUniversal  made a $200 million [[equity investment  in BuzzFeed. Along with plans to hire more journalists to build a more prominent ""investigative"" unit, BuzzFeed planned on hiring journalists around the world and plans to open outposts in India, Germany, Mexico, and Japan. It planned on hiring staff for its UK bureau, its rapidly-expanding motion picture unit and its food-themed business, Tasty.  In October 2016, BuzzFeed raised $200 million from [[Comcast 's TV and movie arm NBCUniversal, at a valuation of roughly $1.7 billion. Altogether, Comcast and its NBCUniversal subsidiary own about a third of BuzzFeed. BuzzFeed has said that it intends to stay independent.  In 2019, BuzzFeed planned to make a 15% overall reduction in headcount across the company, due to recent decreases in profitability.   ===Acquisitions=== BuzzFeed's first acquisition was in 2012 when the company purchased Kingfish Labs, a startup founded by [[Rob Fishman , initially focused on optimizing Facebook ads.  On October 28, 2014, BuzzFeed announced its next acquisition, taking hold of Torando Labs. The Torando team was to become BuzzFeed's first data engineering team.  ==Content== BuzzFeed produces daily content, in which the work of staff reporters, contributors, syndicated cartoon artists, and its community are featured. Popular formats on the website include lists, videos, and quizzes. The style of such content inspired the parody website [[ClickHole .<ref name=""LaFrance&Meyer-Atlantic""/><ref name=slate-ClickHole></ref> While BuzzFeed initially was focused exclusively on such viral content, according to ''[[The New York Times '', ""it added more traditional content, building a track record for delivering breaking news and deeply reported articles"" in the years up to 2014.<ref name=""nytimes.com""></ref> In that year, BuzzFeed deleted over 4000 early posts, ""apparently because, as time passed, they looked stupider and stupider"", as observed by ''[[The New Yorker ''.  BuzzFeed consistently ranked at the top of [[NewsWhip 's ""Facebook Publisher Rankings"" from December 2013 to April 2014, until ''The Huffington Post'' entered the position.  ===News===  BuzzFeed's news division began in December 2011 with the appointment of Ben Smith as editor-in-chief. In 2013, Pulitzer Prize winner [[Mark Schoofs  of [[ProPublica  was hired as head of investigative reporting.<ref name=""Mullin-Poynter-2017""></ref> By 2016, BuzzFeed had 20 investigative journalists.<ref name="":1""></ref>  ===Video=== BuzzFeed Video, BuzzFeed Motion Picture's flagship [[YouTube  channel, produces original content. Its production studio and team are based in Los Angeles. Since hiring [[Ze Frank  in 2012, BuzzFeed Video has produced several video series, including ""[[The Try Guys "". In August 2014, the company announced a new division, BuzzFeed Motion Pictures, which may produce feature-length films.<ref name=""nytimes.com"" /> As of August 27, 2018, BuzzFeed Video's YouTube channel had garnered more than 13.8 billion views and more than 17.2 million subscribers. BuzzFeed later announced that YouTube signed on for two feature-length series to be created by BuzzFeed Motion Pictures, entitled ''[[Broke  TV series |Broke '' and ''[[Squad Wars ''.  ===Podcasts=== BuzzFeed started an in-house podcasting team in 2015, through which the podcasts ''[[Another Round  podcast |Another Round '' and ''Internet Explorer'' were developed and launched.<ref name=""wsj-podcast""></ref> In September 2018, BuzzFeed shut down its podcast department and laid off the staff due to a lack of desired ad revenue. It cancelled most of its podcasts, including ''See Something, Say Something''.<ref name=""cjr-mediameltdown""></ref><ref name=""variety-podcasts""></ref> In late January of 2019, they fired 200 staff across the company and cancelled the remaining podcast, ''Thirst Aid Kit''.<ref name=""cjr-mediameltdown"" />  ;Former podcasts *''Another Round'' *''Internet Explorer''  *''The News''  *''See Something, Say Something''  *''[[Thirst Aid Kit ''  *''Reporting To You''  *''Rerun''  *''The Tell Show''  *''Women of the Hour''  ===Community===  On July 17, 2012, humor website ''[[McSweeney's Internet Tendency '' published a satirical piece entitled ""Suggested BuzzFeed Articles"", prompting BuzzFeed to create many of the suggestions.<ref name=""buzzfeed.com""></ref><ref name=""contently.com""></ref><ref name=""observer.com""></ref> BuzzFeed listed McSweeney's as a ""Community Contributor.""<ref name=""buzzfeed.com"" /> The post subsequently received more than 350,000 page views,<ref name=""contently.com"" /> prompted BuzzFeed to ask for user submissions,<ref name=""buzzfeed.com"" /><ref name=""upi.com""></ref> and received media attention.<ref name=""contently.com"" /><ref name=""observer.com"" /><ref name=""upi.com"" /> Subsequently, the website launched the ""Community"" section in May 2013 to enable users to submit content. Users initially are limited to publishing only one post per day, but may increase their submission capacity by raising their ""Cat Power"", described on the BuzzFeed website as ""an official measure of your rank in BuzzFeed's Community."" A user's Cat Power increases as they achieve greater prominence on the site.  In January 2017, BuzzFeed's user-generated community content accumulated 100 millions view.  ===Technology and social media=== BuzzFeed receives the majority of its traffic by creating content that is shared on [[social media  websites. BuzzFeed works by judging their content on how viral it will become, operating in a ""continuous feedback loop"" where all of its articles and videos are used as input for its sophisticated data operation.<ref name=fastcompany></ref> The site continues to test and track their custom content with an in-house team of data scientists and an external-facing ""social dashboard"". Using an algorithm dubbed ""Viral Rank"" created by [[Jonah Peretti  and [[Duncan J. Watts|Duncan Watts , the company uses this formula to let editors, users, and advertisers try many different ideas, which maximizes distribution. Staff writers are ranked by views on an internal leaderboard. In 2014, BuzzFeed received 75% of its views from links on social media outlets such as [[Pinterest , [[Twitter , and [[Facebook .<ref name=""insidebuzzfeed"" /><ref name=""nytimes.com"" />  ===''Tasty''=== BuzzFeed's video series on [[comfort food , ''Tasty'', is made for [[Facebook , where it has 98 million followers . The channel has substantially more views than BuzzFeed's dedicated food site. The channel included five spinoff segments: ""Tasty Junior""—which eventually spun off into its own page, ""Tasty Happy Hour""  alcoholic beverages , ""Tasty Fresh"", ""Tasty Vegetarian"", and ""Tasty Story""—which has celebrities making and discussing their own recipes. ''Tasty'' has also released a cookbook.  The company also operates these international versions of ''Tasty'' in other languages. ''Tasty'' has also released its own kitchenware, which includes several products such as spatulas, cooking sheets, and mixing bowls. These products are sold in collaboration with Walmart.''Tasty'' also sells their ""One Top"", which is a smart induction cooktop, as well as ""Tasty Kits"", which are kits that contains cooking items for cooking at home.  ===''Worth It''===  Since 2016, Tasty also sponsors a show named ''Worth It'' starring Steven Lim, Andrew Ilnyckyj, and Adam Bianchi. In each episode, the trio visit three different food places with three drastically different price points in one food category. Steven Lim also stars in BuzzFeed Blue's ""Worth It – Lifestyle"" videos. The series is similar, in that three items or experiences are valued from different companies, each at their different price point, but focus on material items and experiences, such as plane seats, hotel rooms, and haircuts.  ===''BuzzFeed Unsolved''=== ''[[BuzzFeed Unsolved '' is the most successful web series on BuzzFeed's BuzzFeed Multiplayer, created by Ryan Bergara. The show features Bergara and Shane Madej  who replaced original co-host Brent Bennett . The show covers some of history's most famous unsolved mysteries, presenting them and the theories that surround them in a comedic manner. In some episodes, they even visit the places involved with the mystery, often [[ghost hunting  during Supernatural episodes.  ===The Try Guys=== [[The Try Guys  are a quartet of friends  Eugene Lee Yang, Ned Fulmer, Keith Habersberger, and Zach Kornfeld  who put themselves in different, and at times, compromising situations and record the results. In June 2018, the four left BuzzFeed and created their own independent channel, also titled ""The Try Guys"".''  ===''Night In / Night Out''=== Night In/Night Out is a series run by Ned and Ariel Fulmer. This show features the couple on two different dates, one at home featuring a homemade meal  using a BuzzFeed Tasty Recipe  and one at a restaurant in the Los Angeles area. Each episode focuses on one particular meal, such as baked salmon or hamburgers. At the end of each episode, Ned and Ariel decide whether they preferred the home-cooked meal  and the accompanying ambiance and price tag  or the meal at the restaurant. Ned and Ariel recently left BuzzFeed and was subsequently canceled.   ==Notable stories== ===""The dress""===  </ref> |source = |align = right |width = 40% |qalign = left |salign = right|author = Cates Holderness  In February 2015, a post resulting in a debate over the color of an item of clothing from BuzzFeed's Tumblr editor Cates Holderness garnered more than 28 million views in one day, setting a record for most concurrent visitors to a BuzzFeed post. Holderness had shown the picture to other members of the site's [[social media  team, who immediately began arguing about the dress colors among themselves. After creating a simple poll for users of the site, she left work and took [[New York City Subway|the subway  back to her [[Brooklyn  home. When she got off the train and checked her telephone, it was overwhelmed by the messages on various sites. ""I couldn't open [[Twitter  because it kept crashing. I thought somebody had died, maybe. I didn't know what was going on."" Later in the evening the page set a new record at BuzzFeed for [[Session  web analytics |concurrent visitors , which reached 673,000 at its peak.<ref name=OralHistory/><ref name=BBCNews1January2016></ref>  ===Watermelon stunt===  On April 8, 2016, two BuzzFeed interns created a live stream on [[Facebook , during which rubber bands were wrapped one by one around a [[watermelon  until the pressure [[Exploding watermelon stunt|caused it to explode . ''The Daily Dot'' compared it to something from ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos '' or by the comedian [[Gallagher  comedian |Gallagher , and ""just as stupid-funny, but with incredible immediacy and zero production costs"". The video is seen as part of Facebook's strategy to shift to live video, [[Facebook Live , to counter the rise of [[Snapchat  and [[Periscope  app |Periscope  among a younger audience.<ref name=""dailydot"">Hathaway, Jay  April 8, 2016 . [http://www.dailydot.com/lol/watermelon-explosion-facebook-future/ Welp, the future of Facebook is exploding watermelons], ''The Daily Dot''</ref>  ==Awards and recognition== In 2017, BuzzFeed won [[Webby Awards  for Best News App and Best Interview/Talk Show  for ''[[Another Round  podcast |Another Round '' , and president Greg Coleman was named Publishing Executive of the Year by ''[[Digiday ''.  In 2018, staff of BuzzFeed news was nominated and a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in their international reporting category for their article that ""proved that operatives with apparent ties to Vladimir Putin have engaged in a targeted killing campaign against his perceived enemies on British and American soil"".  ==Criticism and controversies==  ===Plagiarism=== [[File:Benny Johnson  12555523704 .jpg|thumb|[[Benny Johnson  journalist |Benny Johnson  was fired from BuzzFeed in July 2014 for plagiarism.  BuzzFeed has been accused of plagiarizing original content from competitors throughout the online and offline press. In June 2012, [[Gawker 's [[Adrian Chen  observed that one of BuzzFeed's most popular writers—[[Matt Stopera —frequently had copied and pasted ""chunks of text into lists without attribution.""<ref name=""gawkplag""></ref> In March 2013, ''[[The Atlantic Wire '' also reported several ""listicles"" had apparently been copied from [[Reddit  and other websites. In July 2014, BuzzFeed writer [[Benny Johnson  journalist |Benny Johnson  was accused of multiple instances of plagiarism.<ref name=""politcoplag""></ref> Two anonymous Twitter users chronicled Johnson attributing work that was not his own, but ""directly lift[ed] from other reporters, [[Wikipedia , and [[Yahoo! Answers "", all without credit. BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith initially defended Johnson, calling him a ""deeply original writer"".<ref name=""farhi""></ref> Days later, Smith acknowledged that Johnson had plagiarized the work of others 40 times and announced that Johnson had been fired, apologizing to BuzzFeed readers. ""Plagiarism, much less copying unchecked facts from Wikipedia or other sources, is an act of disrespect to the reader"", Smith said. ""We are deeply embarrassed and sorry to have misled you.""<ref name=""farhi"" /> In total, 41 instances of plagiarism were found and corrected. In 2016, claims surfaced of the YouTube channel BuzzFeedVideo stealing ideas and content from other creators. Among the accusers are YouTube users Akilah Obviously, Cr1TiKaL penguinz0  and JaclynGlenn.  BuzzFeed has been the subject of multiple copyright infringement lawsuits, for both using content it had no rights to and encouraging its proliferation without attributing its sources: one for an individual photographer's photograph, and another for nine celebrity photographs from a single photography company.  ===Accuracy and reliability=== In October 2014, a [[Pew Research Center  survey found that in the United States, BuzzFeed was viewed as an unreliable source by the majority of people, regardless of political affiliation.<ref name=""Zhang 2014""></ref> ''[[Adweek '' noted that most respondents had not heard of BuzzFeed, and many users do not consider BuzzFeed a news site. In a subsequent Pew report based on 2014 surveys, BuzzFeed was among the least trusted sources by [[millennials . A 2016 study by the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review '' found readers less likely to trust a story  originally published in ''[[Mother Jones  magazine |Mother Jones ''  that appeared to originate on BuzzFeed than the same article on ''[[The New Yorker '' website.  On January 18, 2019, [[Robert Mueller 's office disputed a BuzzFeed report stating that [[Donald Trump  instructed [[Michael Cohen  lawyer |Michael Cohen  to lie to Congress. A spokesman for Mueller's office characterized the BuzzFeed report as ""not accurate"".<ref name=""polantz""></ref>  ===Unpaid contributors=== Matthew Perpetua, BuzzFeed's director of quizzes, published a blog post in January 2019 after being laid off, revealing that many of the site's most popular quizzes were created by unpaid contributors.<ref name=""Fluxblog 2019""></ref> Perpetua identified one college student in Michigan in particular was ""the second-highest traffic driver worldwide.""<ref name=""The New York Times 2019""></ref> The student, Rachel McMahon said that until she saw Perpetua's blog post, she never knew that her quizzes were so significant for BuzzFeed's traffic. According to the ''[[Detroit Free Press '', she had never asked BuzzFeed about getting paid and the only material goods she received from them were four $30 Amazon gift certificates, a BuzzFeed sweatshirt and T-shirt and several water bottles.  ===Advertiser influence on editorial=== In April 2015, BuzzFeed drew scrutiny after [[Gawker  observed the publication had deleted two posts that criticized advertisers. One of the posts criticized [[Dove  toiletries |Dove soap   manufactured by [[Unilever  , while another criticized [[Hasbro . Both companies advertise with BuzzFeed. Ben Smith apologized in a memo to staff for his actions. ""I blew it,"" Smith wrote. ""Twice in the past couple of months, I've asked editors—over their better judgment and without any respect to our standards or process—to delete recently published posts from the site. Both involved the same thing: my overreaction to questions we've been wrestling with about the place of personal opinion pieces on our site. I reacted impulsively when I saw the posts and I was wrong to do that. We've reinstated both with a brief note."" Days later, one of the authors of the deleted posts, [[Arabelle Sicardi , resigned. An internal review by the company found three additional posts deleted for being critical of products or advertisements  by [[Microsoft , [[Pepsi , and Unilever .  In 2016, the [[Advertising Standards Authority  United Kingdom |Advertising Standards Authority  of the United Kingdom ruled that BuzzFeed broke the UK advertising rules for failing to make it clear that an article on ""14 Laundry Fails We've All Experienced"" that promoted [[Dylon  was an online [[advertorial  paid for by the brand.<ref name=""GuardianASA""></ref> Although the ASA agreed with BuzzFeed's defense that links to the piece from its homepage and search results clearly labelled the article as ""sponsored content,"" this failed to take into account that individuals might link to the story directly, ruling that the labeling ""was not sufficient to make clear that the main content of the web page was an advertorial and that editorial content was therefore retained by the advertiser.""<ref name=""GuardianASA"" />  ===Hiring practices=== In February 2016, [[Scaachi Koul , a Senior Writer for BuzzFeed Canada, tweeted a request for pitches stating that BuzzFeed was ""...looking for mostly non-white non-men"" followed by ""If you are a white man upset that we are looking mostly for non-white non-men I don't care about you go write for Maclean's."" When confronted, she followed with the tweet ""White men are still permitted to pitch, I will read it, I will consider it. I'm just less interested because, ugh, men."" In response to the tweets, Koul received numerous rape and death threats and racist insults. Sarmishta Subramanian, a former colleague of Koul's, writing for ''[[Maclean's '', condemned the reaction to the tweets, and commented that Koul's request for diversity was appropriate. Subramanian said that her provocative approach raised concerns of [[tokenism  that might hamper BuzzFeed's stated goals.  ===Ideology=== BuzzFeed states in its editorial guide that ""we firmly believe that for a number of issues, including civil rights, women's rights, anti-racism, and LGBT equality, there are not two sides"". This has raised questions about whether BuzzFeed undermines its credibility by taking sides on political issues. In June 2015, BuzzFeed and websites like the ''Huffington Post'' and [[Mashable  temporarily changed the theme of their social media avatars to rainbow colors to celebrate same-sex marriage being ruled constitutional in the United States.  In June 2016, the left-leaning media watchdog [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting  found that in 100 BuzzFeed stories about [[Barack Obama , 65 were positive, 34 were neutral, and one was critical. The report called BuzzFeed's coverage of Obama ""creepy"" and ""almost uniformly uncritical and often sycophantic"". BuzzFeed has partnered with Obama on a [[Get out the vote|get-out-the-vote  campaign. Also in June 2016, BuzzFeed cancelled an advertising agreement with the [[Republican National Committee  over what BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti called ""offensive remarks"" made by [[Donald Trump . Peretti said, ""We certainly don't like to turn away revenue that funds all the important work we do across the company. However, in some cases we must make business exceptions: we don't run cigarette ads because they are hazardous to our health, and we won't accept Trump ads for the exact same reason.""  In January 2017, BuzzFeed released what became known as the ""[[Trump–Russia dossier|Steele dossier "", an uncorroborated private intelligence report that alleges several salacious accusations of Trump. Margaret Sullivan at ''[[The Washington Post '' wrote of the release, ""It's a bad idea, and always has been, to publish unverified smears"". David Graham at ''[[The Atlantic '' called it ""an abdication of the basic responsibility of journalism"". [[NBC 's [[Chuck Todd  called the release of the document ""[[fake news "". Ben Smith defended the decision to release the document from accusations that it was done out of partisanship arguing that the dossier is of ""obvious central public importance.""  ==See also== * [[Mic  media company   * [[Upworthy  * [[Vice Media  * [[Vox Media   ==References==   ==Further reading== *   ==External links==  *       [[Category:BuzzFeed|   [[Category:Blogs  [[Category:Media about Internet culture  [[Category:Media companies of the United States  [[Category:Media companies based in New York City  [[Category:Internet properties established in 2006  [[Category:Media companies established in 2006  [[Category:2006 establishments in New York City ","BuzzFeed, Inc. is an American Internet media, news and entertainment company with a focus on digital media; it is based in New York City.

Originally known for online quizzes, ""listicles"", and pop culture articles, the company has grown into a global media and technology company, providing coverage on a variety of topics including politics, DIY, animals, and business. In late 2011, BuzzFeed hired Ben Smith of Politico as editor-in-chief, to expand the site into serious journalism, long-form journalism, and reportage. After years of investment in investigative journalism, by 2018 BuzzFeed News had won the National Magazine Award and the George Polk Award, and been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the Michael Kelly Award.Despite BuzzFeed's entrance into serious journalism, a 2014 Pew Research Center survey found that in the United States, BuzzFeed was viewed as an unreliable source by the majority of respondents, regardless of age or political affiliation. BuzzFeed News has since moved to its own domain rather than exist as a section of the main BuzzFeed website."

Founded by the [[American Jewish Committee  in 1945 under the editorship of [[Elliot E. Cohen   editor from 1945 to 1959 , ''Commentary'' magazine developed into the leading postwar journal of Jewish affairs. The periodical strove to construct a new American Jewish identity while processing the events of the Holocaust, the formation of the State of Israel, and the Cold War. In its heyday, the magazine was edited by [[Norman Podhoretz  from 1960 to 1995. Besides its strong coverage of cultural issues, ''Commentary'' provided a strong voice for the [[anti-Stalinist left . Podhoretz, originally a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal  [[Democratic Party  United States |Democrat  turned [[neoconservatism|neoconservative , moved the magazine to the right and toward the [[Republican Party  United States |Republican Party  in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, ''Commentary'' is regarded as providing well sourced information with a right wing bias in wording and story selection.  ''Commentary'' has been described by Benjamin Balint as the ""contentious magazine that transformed the Jewish left into the neoconservative right"", while, according to historian and literary critic Richard Pells, ""no other journal of the past half century has been so consistently influential, or so central to the major debates that have transformed the political and intellectual life of the United States.""  ==History==  ===Founding and early years=== ''Commentary'' was the successor to the ''Contemporary Jewish Record''. When the ''Record''’s editor died in 1944, its publisher, the [[American Jewish Committee   AJC  consulted with New York intellectuals including [[Daniel Bell  and [[Lionel Trilling : they recommended that the AJC hire [[Elliot E. Cohen|Elliot Cohen , who had been the editor of a Jewish cultural magazine and was then a fundraiser, to start a new journal. Cohen designed ''Commentary'' to reconnect assimilated Jews and Jewish intellectuals with the broader, more traditional and very liberal Jewish community. At the same time the magazine would bring the ideas of the young Jewish [[The New York Intellectuals|New York intellectuals  to a wider audience. It demonstrated that Jewish intellectuals, and by extension all American Jews, had turned away from their past political radicalism to embrace mainstream American culture and values. Cohen stated his grand design in the first issue:<ref name=Problem>Ehrman, John  June 1, 1999  [https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-63090926 ""Commentary, the Public Interest, and the Problem of Jewish Conservatism""], ''[[American Jewish History ''</ref>    As Podhoretz put it, ''Commentary'' was to lead the Jewish intellectuals ""out of the desert of alienation ... and into the promised land of democratic, pluralistic, and prosperous America"".<ref name=Problem/> Cohen brought on board strong editors who themselves wrote important essays, including [[Irving Kristol ; art critic [[Clement Greenberg ; film and cultural critic [[Robert Warshow ; and sociologist [[Nathan Glazer . ''Commentary'' published such rising stars as [[Hannah Arendt , [[Daniel Bell , [[Sidney Hook , and [[Irving Howe .  Although many or even most of the editors and writers had been [[Socialism|socialists , [[Trotskyism|Trotskyites , or [[Stalinism|Stalinists  in the past, that was no longer tolerated. ''Commentary'' articles were anti-[[Communism|Communist  and also anti-[[McCarthyism|McCarthyite ; it identified and attacked any perceived weakness among liberals on [[Cold War  issues, backing President [[Harry Truman 's policies such as the [[Truman Doctrine , the [[Marshall Plan , and [[NATO . The ""soft-on-Communism"" position of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations   CIO  and [[Henry A. Wallace  came under steady attack. Liberals who hated [[Joseph McCarthy  were annoyed when Irving Kristol wrote at the height of the controversy that ""there is one thing that the American people know about Senator McCarthy: he, like them, is unequivocally anti-Communist. About the spokesmen for American liberalism, they feel they know no such thing.""  ===Norman Podhoretz=== In the late 1950s the magazine sagged, as Cohen suffered from mental illness and committed suicide. A protégé of [[Lionel Trilling , [[Norman Podhoretz  took over in 1960, running the magazine with an iron hand until his retirement in 1995. Podhoretz reduced the space given to Jewish issues and moved ''Commentary'''s ideology to the left. Circulation rose to 60,000 as the magazine became a mainstay of the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington  [[liberal elite  in the heyday of Presidents [[John F. Kennedy  and [[Lyndon B. Johnson .  The emergence of the [[New Left , which was bitterly hostile to Johnson, to [[capitalism  and to universities, angered Podhoretz for what he perceived as its shallowness and hostility to [[Israel  in the 1967 [[Six-Day War . Articles attacked the New Left on questions ranging from crime, the nature of art, drugs, poverty, to the new egalitarianism; ''Commentary'' said that the New Left was a dangerous anti-American, anti-liberal, and anti-Semitic force. [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan  used ''Commentary'' to attack the [[Watts riots  and liberals who defended it as a just revolution.<ref name=""Tanenhaus2009""></ref> The shift helped define the emerging [[neoconservative  movement and gave space to disillusioned liberals.  As the readership base shifted to the right, ''Commentary'' filled a vacuum for conservative intellectuals, who otherwise were reliant on [[William F. Buckley, Jr. 's ''[[National Review .'' In March 1975 Moynihan's article ""The United States in Opposition"" urged America to vigorously defend liberal democratic principles when they were attacked by [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc  and [[Third World  dictatorships at the [[United Nations . Moynihan was appointed [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|ambassador to the UN  by President [[Gerald Ford  in 1975 and was elected to the [[United States Senate  in 1976. [[Jeane Kirkpatrick 's November 1979 denunciation of the foreign policy of President [[Jimmy Carter , ""Dictatorships and Double Standards"", impressed [[Ronald Reagan , who defeated Carter in 1980. In 1981 Reagan appointed Kirkpatrick ambassador to the United Nations and ''Commentary'' reached the apogee of its influence.  ===Recent years=== Norman Podhoretz, who served as editor-in-chief until 1995, was editor-at-large until January 2009. [[Neal Kozodoy , at ''Commentary'' since 1966, was editor between 1995 and January 2009; he is the magazine's current editor-at-large. Since January 2009 the journal has been edited by [[John Podhoretz , Norman's son.  The magazine ceased to be affiliated with the AJC in 2007, when Commentary, Inc., an independent [[501 c  3   non-profit enterprise, took over as publisher.  In 2011 the journal announced plans to give its archives from 1945 to 1995 to the [[Harry Ransom Center  at the [[University of Texas at Austin .  Currently, ''Commentary'' prints letters to the editor that comment on various articles three issues earlier. The more critical and lengthy letters tend to be printed first and the more praiseful letters last. The author of the article being discussed almost always replies in a follow-up to his critics. Each issue has several reviews of books on varying topics. ''Commentary'' usually assigns a review to books written by notable contributors to the magazine.  ==Popular culture== ''Commentary'' has been referred to in several [[Woody Allen  films. In ''[[Annie Hall ''  1977 , Allen  as character Alvy Singer  makes a pun by saying that he heard that ''[[Dissent  American magazine |Dissent '' and ''Commentary'' had merged to form ""''[[Dysentery .''"" In ''[[Bananas  film |Bananas ''  1971 , as an old lady is threatened on a subway car, Allen hides his face by holding up an issue of ''Commentary.'' This image is featured at the [[New York Transit Museum  in [[Brooklyn Heights . In ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors '', an issue of ''Commentary'' lies on a character's bedside table.  In his sitcom ''[[Anything but Love '', stand-up comedian [[Richard Lewis  comedian |Richard Lewis  was often shown holding or reading a copy of ''Commentary.''  ==Contributors==  Over the decades the magazine has attracted top American intellectuals—many of them Jewish.

Commentary has been described by Benjamin Balint as the ""contentious magazine that transformed the Jewish left into the neoconservative right"", while, according to historian and literary critic Richard Pells, ""no other journal of the past half century has been so consistently influential, or so central to the major debates that have transformed the political and intellectual life of the United States."""

''The Advertiser'' came under the ownership of [[Keith Murdoch  in the 1950s, and the full ownership of [[Rupert Murdoch  in 1987. It is now a publication of [[News Corp Australia . Through much of the 20th century, ''The Advertiser'' was Adelaide's morning broadsheet, ''[[The News  Adelaide |The News '' the afternoon tabloid, with ''[[Sunday Mail  Adelaide |The Sunday Mail '' covering weekend sport, and ''[[Messenger Newspapers '' community news. The head office was relocated from a former premises in [[King William Street, Adelaide|King William Street , to a new News Corp office complex, known as [[Keith Murdoch  House at 31 Waymouth Street.  ==History== [[File:Advertiser Building.JPG|thumb|The office of ''The Advertiser'' in Waymouth Street, Adelaide   ===''The South Australian Advertiser''=== An early major daily colonial newspaper, ''[[Adelaide Times|The Adelaide Times '', ceased publication on 9 May 1858. Shortly afterwards, [[John Henry Barrow|Reverend John Henry Barrow , a former editor of the ''[[South Australian Register '' founded the morning newspaper ''The South Australian Advertiser'' and a companion weekly ''[[The Chronicle  South Australia |The South Australian Weekly Chronicle .'' The original owners were Barrow and [[Charles Henry Goode , and the first issues were published on 12 July 1858 and 17 July 1858 respectively.<ref name=""SAAdvertiser"" /> It initially consisted of four pages, each of seven columns, and cost 4 pence.  In 1863 the company started an afternoon newspaper ''The Express'' as a competitor to ''[[The Telegraph  Adelaide |The Telegraph '', an afternoon/evening daily paper independent of both ''The Advertiser'' and the ''South Australian Register''.<ref name=""ATS""></ref> The company was then re-formed, effective 9 September 1864, with additional shareholders [[Philip Henry Burden , [[John Baker  Australian politician |John Baker , Captain Scott, James Counsell, Thomas Graves and others. Burden, secretary of the company, died in 1864, and Barrow, whose wife had died in 1856, married his widow in 1865, thus owning together a quarter of the company. In December 1866, the syndicate bought the now defunct ''The Telegraph''  by this time renamed ''The Daily Telegraph'' with a morning edition and a weekend ''Weekly Mail''  at auction, and incorporated it with ''The Express'' to form ''The Express and Telegraph''.<ref name=""ATS"" />  In 1871, when the shareholders were Barrow, Goode, Robert Stuckey, Thomas Graves, [[William Parkin , Thomas King, James Counsell, and George Williams Chinner, the partnership was dissolved and the business was carried on by Barrow and King. J. H. Barrow died on 22 August 1874, and Thomas King ran the papers for himself and Mrs. Barrow for about five years.<ref name=""ATS"" /> In 1879 a new firm was created, consisting of Thomas King, [[Fred Burden   son of P. H. Burden and adopted son of J. H. Barrow , and [[John Langdon Bonython . In July 1884, Thomas King dropped out, and the firm of Burden & Bonython was formed to run the paper.<ref name=""ATS"" />  === ''The Advertiser'' === On 1 April 1889, the main publication was re-branded with an abbreviated title, ''The Advertiser''.<ref name=""SAAdvertiser"" /> In December 1891, Burden retired, and sold his share of the company to Bonython,<ref name=""langdon"">W.

As well as being a talented newspaper editor, he also supported the movement towards the [[Federation of Australia . Later, in 1923, after a run of 60 years, ''The Express'' was stopped just as its renamed rival, ''The News'', was starting. On 12 January 1929, ''The Mail'' announced that Bonython had sold ''The Advertiser'' for £1,250,000 to a group of Melbourne financiers ''[[The Herald and Weekly Times '', an external media company, now had the controlling stake, but Bonython still retained a 48.7% interest.

Following the handover, and in response to suggestions of external influences from Victoria made by competing newspaper ''The Mail'', the Chairman of ''The Advertiser's'' board published its policy in ''The Advertiser'' as follows: <blockquote>""It is the same today as when the late Sir Langdon Bonython was in sole control. It is based upon a profound pride and belief in South Australia, and the system of private enterprise which has made this State what it is.""</blockquote>  On 24 October 1953 the company launched the ''Sunday Advertiser'' in direct competition to News Limited's ''The Mail'', but failed to outreach its rival, though no doubt affecting its profitability. It ceased publication five years or so later, after which the by then renamed ''Sunday Mail'' advertised itself as a joint publication of Advertiser Newspapers and News Ltd., and incorporated many of the ''Sunday Advertiser'' regular features. It had also introduced colour graphics on the comics page  rather primitive by today's standards , but this was dropped shortly after joint publication commenced.  In addition, ''[[Messenger Newspapers|The Messenger '', published since 1951 was partially purchased in 1962, and fully owned by 1983. When Murdoch acquired ''The Herald and Weekly Times'' in 1987, he also acquired the remaining 48.7% share of ''The Advertiser''. He sold ''The News'' in 1987, and it was closed in 1992. Murdoch then changed the format of ''The Advertiser'' from a broadsheet to a tabloid in November 1997, and the [[Masthead  publishing |masthead  and content [[font  and layout was modernised in September 2009.  ==Circulation== ''The Advertiser'' is available for purchase throughout [[South Australia  and some towns and regions in [[New South Wales , Victoria and the [[Northern Territory  located near or adjacent to the South Australia state border such as [[Broken Hill , [[Mildura , [[Nhill, Victoria|Nhill  and [[Alice Springs . According to ''The Advertiser'''s website, the newspaper is read by over 580,000 people each weekday, and by more than 740,000 people each Saturday. Circulation figures reported in May 2016 by [[Roy Morgan Research  showed a continuing decline in readership, of 324,000 on weekdays, and 371,000 on Saturdays.

Thailand at the time was the only Southeast Asian country to have a [[Diplomatic missions of Russia|Soviet Embassy . The U.S. embassy felt it needed an independent, but generally pro-American newspaper to counter Soviet views. Some claim the financing came directly from the [[United States Department of State|US State Department  or possibly even the OSS itself, although there is no proof of this.  Nevertheless, under MacDonald's stewardship, the ''Bangkok Post'' was reasonably independent and employed many young newsmen, including [[Peter Arnett  and [[T. D. Allman , who later became known internationally. Alex MacDonald left Thailand after a military coup in the early 1950s, and the newspaper was later led by [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy, Lord Thomson . The paper has since changed hands. Major shareholders in Post Publishing include the Chirathivat family  owners of [[Central Group  , the ''[[South China Morning Post '' of [[Hong Kong  and [[GMM Grammy|GMM Grammy Pcl , Thailand's biggest media and entertainment company.  Post Publishing PLC, publisher of the ''Bangkok Post'', ''Post Today''  daily Thai language business , and ''M2F''  free Thai language daily  newspapers, returned a modest profit of 450,000 baht in 2016 compared to a 42.1 million baht loss in 2015.<ref name=""KE-20170108""></ref>  ==Staffing== The ''Bangkok Post'' employs  April 2015  179 journalists, including reporters, rewriters, editors, copyeditors, photographers, and designers. Twenty-nine foreign nationals work as copyeditors and print and digital news editors. Sunday editor Paul Ruffini is an Australian national. All ''Post'' staff reporters are Thai nationals, as fluency in Thai required. Foreign staff write for the newspaper's news, op-ed, sports, business, and features sections.<ref name=BP-20150417></ref>  ==Editorial stance== In a country where media censorship is common, the ''Bangkok Post'' portrays itself as being comparatively free. There are instances where the newspaper has been accused of self-censorship to avoid controversy or conflict with powerful individuals, including adherence to the country's strict [[Lèse majesté in Thailand|lèse-majesté  law, which prohibits open criticism of members of the [[Thai Royal Family . Yet another example was the newspaper's failure during the [[Vietnam War  to report on bombing forays made from US Air Force bases in Thailand over military targets in [[North Vietnam  and [[Cambodia , none of which received coverage in the local press.  Throughout the early 2000s, the ''Bangkok Post'' took positions that were, at times, generally favorable to the government. Since the [[Thai general election, 2011|Thai election of 2011 , however, the paper has taken a largely anti-Thaksin position aligned with the [[People's Alliance for Democracy|Yellow Shirts  and the [[Democrat Party  Thailand |Democrat Party .  The ''Bangkok Post'' was at one time well known among expatriates for [[Bernard Trink 's weekly ''Nite Owl'' column, which covered the nightlife of Bangkok. Trink's column was published from 1966  originally in the ''Bangkok World''  until 2004, when it was discontinued. The newspaper has a letters page where expatriate and Thai regulars exchange opinions on local and international concerns. According to the ''Post'', more than half of its total readership are Thai nationals.<ref name=BP-20150417 />  During the tenure of Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra , the ''Post'' largely toed the government line—at one point bowing to government pressure by firing a reporter who had exposed cracks in the runway of the prestige project [[Suvarnabhumi Airport  along with the news editor, while [[The Nation  Thailand |''the Nation''  actively campaigned for Thaksin to resign.  ==Sections== * Main body: Local, regional and world news, opinion and analysis pages, and sports news. * Business: Local, regional and world business and financial news and stock-market tables. * Life: A features section including human-interest stories, travel, motoring, technology, entertainment news, a society page, advice columns, comics, puzzles, local television listings and film advertisements. * ""Elite Life"": Published the last Friday of every month.

The domain name was acquired by [[Al Jazeera Media Network  in March 2011 from [[Aljazeera Publishing , a Dubai-based media company which owned the separate Aljazeera Magazine, after a long-running domain name dispute between the two entities. Al Jazeera English began promoting aljazeera.com instead of aljazeera.net/english since the domain name became part of Al Jazeera English. It is also used and subdivided as the homepage for the channels of Al Jazeera America and Al Jazeera Balkans. Al Jazeera Media Network also owns the original '''Aljazeera.net''' for their Arabic language channels and properties and '''Aljazeera.tr''' for their Turkish language properties including [[Al Jazeera Turk .  ==History of Al Jazeera Magazine== Until March 2011, aljazeera.com was an English language website for ''Aljazeera Magazine'', which was unrelated to the Arabic satellite TV channel [[Al Jazeera ; the latter operated websites in both Arabic  [http://www.aljazeera.net www.aljazeera.net]  and English  [http://english.aljazeera.net english.aljazeera.net] . It was also unrelated to ''Al Jazeera Newspaper'' of Saudi Arabia. According to Alexa, there were fewer visitors to aljazeera.com in comparison to aljazeera.net. The former website was operated by [[Aljazeera Publishing , described as an ""independent media organisation.""  ===Domain name dispute===  In 2005, the Al Jazeera TV channel attempted to obtain the aljazeera.com domain name but failed.  In the Administrative Panel Decision, the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center found the TV Channel to have brought the proceedings in bad faith and found it had abused the administrative proceedings.  As of 2006, ''Aljazeera.com'' wrote on their ''About'' page:  :''""Important note: Aljazeera Publishing and Aljazeera.com are not associated with any of the below organisations:  :''1. Al Jazeera Newspaper, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia whose website is al-jazirah.com'' :''2. Al Jazeera Satellite Channel whose website is aljazeera.net.'' :''3. Al Jazeera Information Centre who website is aljazeerah.info''  :''Aljazeera Publishing disassociates itself from the views, opinions and broadcasts of these titles.""''  Views presented by Aljazeera.com are frequently misattributed to the Al Jazeera TV channel, including one case in which ''[[The Times '' criticised the channel in its leader column based on material published on Aljazeera.com, for which the newspaper later apologised. The magazine's editorial slant appears markedly different than that of the Al Jazeera TV channel, with the former far more critical of U.S. and Israeli policy than the latter.  In April 2011, the domain aljazeera.com directed to [[Al Jazeera English , and the domain ownership as listed on WHOIS records was updated from Al Jazeera Publishing to Al Jazeera Media Network. At the time of the purchase, a simple page stated ""Moving to Doha"", leading to certain long-time readers initially suspecting a hack of the website. No public details regarding the purchase of the domain has been made public by either party.  ==Activity since takeover== Since the takeover of aljazeera.com, Al Jazeera Media Network has subdivided the domain into other websites for their other non-Arabic news channels besides Al Jazeera English. In 2011 upon the launch of [[Al Jazeera Balkans  the channel created balkans.aljazeera.com which became the main page for the Al Jazeera Balkans website.  In 2013 Al Jazeera did it again with the website for [[Al Jazeera America  creating america.aljazeera.com which is the main page for that channels website and to which aljazeera.com in the United States redirected to on the first click into aljazeera.com during the existence of the American channel. From there you would have the option of going to the Al Jazeera English page. Al Jazeera is also used the .aljazeera.com domain for specials between the two channels and cross links between the two. After the folding of Al Jazeera America and a re-design of the main aljazeera.com the america.aljazeera.com address beginning in November 2016 was redirected to the main Aljazeera.com  In 2014 Al Jazeera created plus.aljazeera.com, a secondary page for their all digital, all online and video on demand channel [[AJ+ . Its primary page is '''ajplus.net'''.  As part of a 2014 re-design of the Al Jazeera English site, a new video.aljazeera.com was launched that offers a live stream of Al Jazeera English and Al Jazeera English shows and documentaries on demand. It is possible that the site could include video from other Al Jazeera channels.  ==References==   ==External links== *   * [http://balkans.aljazeera.com/ balkans.aljazeera.com Al Jazeera Balkans] , ,     [[Category:Al Jazeera  [[Category:Qatari news websites  [[Category:Broadcasting websites  [[Category:Internet properties established in 2011 ","Aljazeera.com is the main web address for the Al Jazeera English, Al Jazeera Balkans and former Al Jazeera America websites.

At the time of its acquisition of ''The News'', Gannett also had other Detroit interests, as its outdoor advertising company, which ultimately became [[Outfront Media  through a series of mergers, operated many billboards across Detroit and the surrounding area, including advertising displays on [[Detroit Department of Transportation  and [[Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority  buses, with its only competitor, primarily along [[Roads and freeways in metropolitan Detroit#Freeways|Metro Detroit's freeway network , being 3M National Advertising  now [[Lamar Advertising  .  ''The News'' claims to have been the first newspaper in the world to operate a [[radio  station, station 8MK, which began broadcasting August 20, 1920.  8MK is now CBS-owned [[WWJ  AM |WWJ .

Scripps , who, in turn, was the older half-brother and one-time partner of [[Edward W. Scripps . The paper's eventual success, however, is largely credited to Scripps' son-in-law, [[George Gough Booth , who came aboard at the request of his wife's father. Booth went on to construct Michigan's largest newspaper empire, founding the independent [[Booth Newspapers  chain  now owned by [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Jr.|S.I. Newhouse 's [[Advance Publications   with his two brothers.  ''The Detroit News'' building was erected in 1917. It was designed by [[architect  [[Albert Kahn  architect |Albert Kahn , who included a faux-stone concrete building with large street level arches to admit light. The arches along the east and south side of the building were bricked-in for protection after the [[12th Street Riot  in 1967. The bricked-in arches on the east and south ends of the building were reopened during renovations required when the ''Free Press'' relocated its offices there 20 years later.  In 1931, ''The Detroit News'' made history when it bought a three place [[Pitcairn PCA-2  auto-gyro as a camera aircraft which could take off and land in restricted places and semi-hover for photos.  It was the ancestor of today's well known news helicopter.<ref name=hover></ref> In 1935 a single [[Lockheed Model 9 Orion  was purchased and modified by Lockheed as a news camera plane for ''The Detroit News''. To work in that role, a pod was built into the frontal leading edge of the right wing about  out from the fuselage. This pod had a glass dome on the front and a mounted camera. To aim the camera the pilot was provided with a primitive grid-like gun sight on his windshield.<ref name=camera></ref>  July 13, 1995, [[Newspaper Guild  employees of the ''Detroit Free Press'' and ''The News'' along with pressmen, printers and [[Teamsters , working for the ""Detroit Newspapers"" distribution arm, [[Detroit newspaper strike of 1995–97|went on strike . Approximately half of the staffers crossed the picket line before the unions ended their strike in February 1997.  The strike was resolved in court three years later, with the journalists' union losing its unfair labor practices case on appeal.  Still, the weakened unions remain active at the paper, representing a majority of the employees under their jurisdiction.  August 3, 2005, Gannett announced that it would sell ''The News'' to [[MediaNews Group  and purchase the ''Free Press'' from the [[Knight Ridder  company.  With this move, Gannett became the managing partner in the papers' joint operating agreement. On May 7, 2006, the combined Sunday ''Detroit News and Free Press'' were replaced by a stand-alone Sunday ''Free Press.'' On December 16, 2008, Detroit Media Partnership announced a plan to limit weekday home delivery for both dailies to Thursday and Friday only.

133,Y,fas.org,"    The '''Federation of American Scientists'''  '''FAS'''  is a [[501 c  3  organization  with the stated intent of using science and scientific analysis to attempt to make the world more secure. FAS was founded in 1945 by scientists who worked on the [[Manhattan Project  to develop the first atomic bombs.  With 100 sponsors,<ref name = ""autogenerated1""></ref> FAS claims that it promotes a safer and more secure world by developing and advancing solutions to important science and technology [[security policy  problems by educating the public and policy makers, and promoting [[transparency  behavior |transparency  through research and analysis to maximize impact on policy. FAS projects are organized in three main programs: nuclear security, government secrecy, and [[biosecurity .  ==History== [[File:Federation of American Scientists  logo .gif|thumb|FAS logo  FAS was founded as the Federation of Atomic Scientists on November 30, 1945, by a group of [[scientists  and [[engineers  within the Associations of Manhattan Project Scientists, [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge  Scientists, and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos  Scientists. Its early mission was to support the [[McMahon Act  of 1946, educate the public, [[News media|press , politicians, and policy-makers, and promote international transparency and [[nuclear disarmament . On January 6, 1946, FAS changed its name to the Federation of American Scientists, but its purpose remained the same—to agitate for the international control of [[Nuclear reaction|atomic energy  and its devotion to peaceful uses, public promotion of science and the freedom and integrity of scientists and scientific research. For this purpose, permanent headquarters were set up in [[Washington, D.C. , and contacts were established with the several branches of government, the [[United Nations , professional and private organizations, and influential persons.  By 1948, the Federation had grown to twenty local associations, with 2,500 members, and had been instrumental in the passage of the [[McMahon Act  and the [[National Science Foundation , and had influenced the American position in the [[United Nations  with regard to international control of atomic energy and disarmament.  In addition to influencing government policy, it undertook a program of public education on the nature and control of atomic energy through lectures, films, exhibits, and the distribution of literature, coordinating its own activities with that of member organizations through the issue of [[memorandum , policy statements, information sheets, and newsletters.  ===Mission=== The mission of FAS is to promote a safer and more secure world by developing and advancing solutions to important science and technology security policy problems by educating the public and policy makers, and promoting transparency through research and analysis to maximize impact on policy.  ==Nuclear Security Program== Continuing the FAS tradition of international control of atomic energy and devotion to its peaceful uses, the Nuclear Security Program  pursues projects that create a more secure world. SSP includes program work that focuses on reducing the risks of further nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism.  ===Nuclear Information Project=== The Nuclear Information Project provides the [[general public  and policy-makers with information and analysis on the status, number, and operation of [[nuclear weapons , the policies that guide their potential use and nuclear arms control. The project reports on developments in the [[nuclear fuel cycle  that are relevant to [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear weapons proliferation . The project puts technical information into a nonproliferation context and looks at case studies by conducting independent calculations and analyses.  ==Government Secrecy== The Government Secrecy Project works to promote public access to [[government  information and to illuminate the apparatus of government secrecy, including [[national security classification  and [[declassification  policies. The project also publishes previously undisclosed or hard-to-find government documents of public policy interest, as well as resources on intelligence policy.  The project publication is Secrecy News, which reports on new developments in government secrecy and provides public access to documentary resources on secrecy, intelligence, and national security policy.  The Government Secrecy Project is directed by [[Steven Aftergood , who is also editor and author of Secrecy News.  ==Legacy programs and projects ==  ===Arms Sales Monitoring Project=== The Arms Sales Monitoring Project  ASMP  worked to increase transparency, accountability and restraint in the legal [[arms industry|arms trade ; eradicate the illicit arms trade; and served as a repository of data on U.S. arms transfers and arms export controls.  Project work focused on the arms trade, U.S. arms export policies, and the illicit trade in [[small arms  and light weapons through the publication of reports and articles, media outreach, and public speaking.  The Arms Sales Monitoring Project was discontinued in 2014.  ===Biosecurity Program=== The '''Biosecurity Program''' concentrates on researching and advocating policies that balance science and security without compromising [[national security  or scientific progress. This includes preventing the misuse of research and promoting the public understanding of the real threats from [[biological  and [[chemical weapons .  The Virtual Biosecurity Center provides the public with a resource to find the latest updates on [[biosecurity  policy, [[bioterrorism  information, and [[biodefense  research.  ===Military Analysis Network=== The Military Analysis Network offered information on U.S. and Foreign Weapon Systems, [[Munitions , and [[space weapon|Weapons in Space . The Network provided resources and databases in several categories including: *A guide to United States Munitions and Weapons Systems *Rest of World Military Equipment by Country Index *United States Military Logistics Index *Selected Country Military Summaries Index *Report on Weapons in Space  This is a legacy project and information is no longer updated by FAS staff.  ===Learning Technologies Program=== The '''Learning Technologies Program  LTP ''' focused on ways to use innovative technologies to improve how people teach and learn. The LTP created [[prototype  games and learning tools and assembled collaborative projects consisting of [[NGOs , design professionals, and community leaders to undertake innovative education initiatives at both the national and local level.  The Project worked to help create learning tools to bring about major gains in learning and training. The major project of the Program is [[Immune Attack , a fully 3-D game in which high school students discover the inner workings of the body's circulatory and immune systems, as they pilot a tiny drone through the bloodstream to fight microscopic invaders.  Immune Attack was jointly developed by the Federation of American Scientists, the [[the University of Southern California|University of Southern California , [[Brown University , and Escape Hatch Entertainment. Immune Attack is a supplemental teaching tool, designed to be used in addition to middle school and high school biology textbooks. It introduces [[molecular biology  and [[cellular biology  in detail that is usually reserved for college students. However, it uses the familiar and motivational video game format to introduce the strange and new world of [[cell  biology |cell s and [[molecules .  The Learning Technologies Program was discontinued in 2013.  ===Earth Systems Program=== The''' Earth Systems Program  ESP ''' examined the increased stresses on the environment, including issues relating to energy, food, agriculture, water, and other [[natural resources , and to analyze how they interact with respect to [[international security . ESP was created out of the idea that technology should allow people worldwide to improve their [[living standards  and amenities through secure and [[environmentally friendly  ways.  The program worked improve dialogue and trust between [[environmental scientist s, policy makers, and the public, as well as to develop science partnerships to solve critical environment and energy problems.  ===Building Technologies Project=== The FAS Building Technologies Project was initiated in 2001 to focus the efforts of scientists and engineers who specialize in building materials on a range of issues such as [[structural engineering , [[indoor air quality , [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency , and [[architectural design  to create homes that are safe, affordable, and attractive to builders and owners in the United States and abroad.  The Building Technologies Program worked to advance innovation in [[building design  and construction that can improve quality, affordability, energy efficiency and hazard protection while lowering construction and [[operating costs . Technical advances, including new composite materials and [[prefabricated  components, help to meet these goals in ways that are beneficial for builders and owners.  The Building Technologies Project combined the talents of renowned architects and engineers along with the nation’s leading energy experts to embark upon housing issues in the United States and abroad.  Program areas included:  * Manufactured housing * Relief housing * Advanced technologies * Learning technologies and training * Policy issues  The Building Technologies Project was discontinued in 2012.  ==Leadership== The Federation of American Scientists is led by a Board of Directors made up of renowned members of the science, business and academic communities.  ==See also== *[[British American Security Information Council  *[[Union of Concerned Scientists   ==References==   ==External links== *  * [https://www.facebook.com/fascientists FAS Facebook page] * [https://www.twitter.com/FAScientists FAS Twitter Page] * [https://www.youtube.com/user/FAScientists FAS YouTube Channel] * [http://www.linkedin.com/companies/federation-of-american-scientists FAS LinkedIn Company Page]   [[Category:Anti–nuclear weapons movement  [[Category:Science and technology in the United States  [[Category:United States government secrecy  [[Category:Arms control  [[Category:Think tanks based in Washington, D.C.

Articles and comment columns are now contributed by writers from [[socialist , [[communist , [[social democratic , [[Green politics|Green  and [[religious  perspectives.<ref name=""news.bbc.co.uk""/>  == The ''Daily Worker''  1930–1966 ==  ===Early years=== [[File:Daily Worker.jpg|thumb|Daily Worker delivery bag  The ''Morning Star'' was founded in 1930 as the ''Daily Worker'', the paper representing the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain   CPGB . The first edition was produced on 1 January 1930 from the offices of the newspaper in Tabernacle Street, London, by eight Party members including [[Kay Beauchamp . In January 1934, the ''Daily Worker'' offices moved to Cayton Street, off [[City Road . The first eight-page ''Daily Worker'' was produced on 1 October 1935.  ===Second World War=== On 3 September 1939, Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain  spoke to the nation on the [[BBC , at which time he announced the formal declaration of war between Britain and [[Nazi Germany . ''Daily Worker'' editor [[John Ross Campbell|J. R. Campbell , backed by his political ally, Party General Secretary [[Harry Pollitt , sought to portray the conflict against [[Hitler  as a continuation of the [[anti-fascist  fight.  This contradicted the position of the [[Comintern  in the aftermath of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact   which became CPGB policy on 3 October  that the war was a struggle between rival imperialist powers, and Campbell was removed as editor as a result, being replaced by [[William Rust  journalist |William Rust .<ref name=""jones"">Bill Jones, ''The Russia complex: the British Labour Party and the Soviet Union''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1977, p.38  .</ref> The paper accused the British government's policies of being ""not to rescue Europe from fascism, but to impose British imperialist peace on Germany"" before attacking the Soviet Union.<ref name=""jones""/> The newspaper responded to the assassination of [[Leon Trotsky  by a Soviet agent with an article on 23 August 1940, entitled ""A Counter Revolutionary Gangster Passes"", written by former editor Campbell.  The paper criticised [[Walter Citrine, 1st Baron Citrine|Sir Walter Citrine  after his meeting in Paris with French Labour Minister Charles Pomaret in December 1939. ''[[Time  magazine |Time '' said of the events following the meeting, ""Minister Pomaret clamped down on French labour with a set of drastic wage-&-hour decrees and Sir Walter Citrine agreed to a proposal by Chancellor of the Exchequer [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon  that pay rises in Britain be stopped"".<ref name=T:RLW></ref> Citrine sued the ''Daily Worker'' for libel after it accused him and his associates of ""plotting with the French Citrines to bring millions of Anglo-French Trade Unionists behind the Anglo-French imperialist war machine""; the publisher pleaded the British press equivalent of 'fair comment'. Citrine alleged, in response to his lawyer's questioning, that the ''Daily Worker'' received £2,000 pounds per month from ""Moscow"", and that Moscow directed the paper to print anti-war stories.<ref name=T:RLW/>  During this period, when the Soviet Union was in alliance with Germany, the ''Daily Worker'' ceased to attack Nazi Germany.<ref name=""MGuardian"">Editorial [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1941/jan/22/past.secondworldwar ""The 'Daily Worker""], ''Manchester Guardian'', 22 January 1941, reprint on ''The Guardian'' website.</ref>   On 21 January 1941, publication of the newspaper was suppressed by the [[Home Secretary  in the wartime coalition, [[Herbert Morrison   a [[Labour Party  UK |Labour Party  MP . It had repeatedly ignored a July 1940 warning that its pacifist line contravened Defence Regulation 2D, which made it an offence to 'systematically to publish matter calculated to foment opposition to the prosecution of the war'. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa  in June 1941, the situation changed; British Communists became fervent supporters of the war, and the ban was later lifted.   For the rest of the war, the paper was a strong supporter of the British war effort, and campaigned to organise a ""[[Western Front  World War II |Second Front "" in Europe to assist the Soviet Union. The government's ban on the ''Daily Worker'' was lifted in September 1942, following a campaign supported by [[Hewlett Johnson , the [[Dean of Canterbury , and Professor [[J. B. S. Haldane . A  ""Lift the ban"" conference at [[Central Hall, Westminster  on 21 March 1942 was attended by over 2,000 delegates. A key part of the campaign was to secure Labour Party support  Herbert Morrison was a fierce opponent of the ''Daily Worker'' . On 26 May 1942, after a heated debate, the Labour Party carried a resolution declaring the Government must lift the ban on the ''Daily Worker''.  During the ban, the ''Daily Worker'' offices at Cayton Street were totally destroyed by fire during [[the Blitz  on 16 April 1941. The paper moved temporarily in 1942 to the former Caledonian Press offices in Swinton Street  whence the old Communist Party ''Sunday Worker'', edited by William Paul, had been published from 15 March 1925 until 1929 . New offices were acquired in 1945, at a former brush-makers' warehouse at 75 [[Farringdon Road , for the sum of £48,000. A Scottish edition of the ''Daily Worker'' was produced from its plant in [[Glasgow  from 11 November 1940.  The ''Daily Worker'' welcomed the dropping of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb on Hiroshima , editorialising ""The employment of the new weapon on a substantial scale should expedite the surrender of Japan"".<ref name=""lsw"">[[Lawrence S. Wittner , ''The Struggle Against The Bomb: Volume One, One World Or None''.  Stanford, California, [[Stanford University Press , p.172 </ref> The paper also applauded the bombing of Nagasaki, and called for the use of additional atomic bombs against the Japanese.<ref name=""lsw""/>  Since September 1945 the paper has been owned and published by a readers' co-operative, the [[People's Press Printing Society , which operates on a one-vote-per-shareholder basis.  ===Postwar=== The ''Daily Worker'' reached its peak circulation after the war, although precise circulation figures are disputed - from 100,000<ref name=""Deeson"" /> to 122,000 to 140,000 and even 500,000.  The ''Daily Worker'' was fully supportive of the show trials in [[Hungary , [[Czechoslovakia  and [[Bulgaria  in the late 1940s, as well as the split with [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito  and Yugoslavia in 1948.  In 1956, the ''Daily Worker'' suppressed correspondent [[Peter Fryer 's reports from the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian revolution , which were favourable to the uprising. The paper denounced the attempted revolution as a ""white terror"", invoking the [[Kingdom of Hungary  1920–46 |Horthy regime  and earlier [[White Terror  Hungary |1919–1921  period.  By the late 1950s the paper was down to just one sheet of four pages. The last edition of the ''Daily Worker'' was published on Saturday 23 April 1966. An editorial in that final issue declared:<blockquote>""On Monday this newspaper takes its greatest step forward for many years. It will be larger, it will be better and it will have a new name.... During its 36 years of life our paper has stood for all that is best in British working-class and Socialist journalism. It has established a reputation for honesty, courage and integrity. It has defended trade unionists, tenants, pensioners. It has consistently stood for peace. It has always shown the need for Socialism. Let all Britain see the ''Morning Star'', the inheritor of a great tradition and the herald of a greater future"".</blockquote>  In February every year between 1950 and 1954, the ''Daily Worker'' held a rally at [[Harringay Arena  in [[Harringay , north London, attended by about 10,000 people. Guests were entertained by tableaux set to music. [[Paul Robeson  also sent recorded messages which were played during the rallies.  ==''Morning Star''  1966–present ==  ===History=== The first edition of the ''Morning Star'' appeared on Monday, 25 April 1966. [[South African people|South African  exile [[Sarah Carneson  worked for the newspaper in the late 1960s.  Until 1974, the paper was subsidised by the Soviet government with direct cash contributions, and from 1974 onwards was indirectly supported by daily bulk orders from Moscow.<ref name=""Deeson""></ref> Its Chief Executive from 1975 was Mary Rosser.<ref name=""telegraph.co.uk""></ref>  By the late 1970s, the paper and the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|CPGB  were beginning to come into conflict with one another, as the [[Eurocommunism|Eurocommunist  trend in the CPGB grew, while the ''Morning Star'' at the time retained a pro-Soviet stance and opposed Eurocommunism. An editorial in ''The Guardian'', however, reported in 1977 that the paper was giving coverage to dissidents in [[Czechoslavakia  and elsewhere in the Soviet bloc to the consternation of about a third of CPGB members who wanted a reversal to a strictly pro-Kremlin line. ""The ''Morning Star'' is open for genuine debate about the future of the Left"", it asserted. A demonstration outside the [[East Germany|East German  embassy against the imprisonment of [[reformist  [[Communist  [[Rudolf Bahro  was organised by the ''Morning Star'' that year. Also in 1977, editor [[Tony Chater  persuaded the [[Labour Party  UK |Labour  government to begin running advertisements in the newspaper, previously absent because of a lack of audited circulation figures.<ref name=""TeleobitChater""></ref>  In December 1981, when the [[Polish people|Polish  [[Solidarity  Polish trade union |Solidarity  [[trade union  movement was suppressed and martial law declared, the paper criticised the Executive Committee of the party for condemning the acts of the  then-Communist  Polish government. In 1982, the ''Morning Star'' attacked the attitudes of ''[[Marxism Today '', the party's monthly journal, which was controlled by the Eurocommunists.  The newspaper attracted some wider media attention in September 1981 when the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC  paid to place six advertisements for its [[Russian-language  service in the ''Morning Star'', which was one of the few [[English language  newspapers that the [[Government of the Soviet Union|USSR government  [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|allowed to be circulated in the country . Four of these advertisements were printed as agreed, but the last two of the six were not printed. A spokesman for the newspaper said that the advertising department had not properly consulted with other teams before making the agreement, and that the BBC's broadcasts were part of [[Cold War  propaganda. The paper supported the [[National Union of Mineworkers  Great Britain |National Union of Mineworkers   NUM  during the [[UK miners' strike  1984–1985 |miners' strike of 1984–1985 , but the party had become critical of NUM leader [[Arthur Scargill 's strategy towards the end of the strike.  Meanwhile, in March 1984, the CPGB Executive Committee  EC  issued a seven-page document which was heavily critical of editor Tony Chater, in particular because he had refused to print an article which commemorated the sixtieth anniversary of the death of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin .<ref name=""TeleobitChater""/> The EC put forward candidates to challenge those loyal to Chater at the 1984 AGM of the PPPS and called for Chater's replacement. He was expelled from the CPGB in January 1985, along with the assistant editor, David Whitfield, reportedly because the attempts to remove him as editor had failed. A statement by the party's EC asserted that the paper was ""being systematically used to attack and undermine congress policy, support factional activities in the party, and help sectarian minority groupings in their opposition to the party majority"".<ref name=""TeleobitChater""/> In June 1985, however, AGMs of the PPPS held in [[Glasgow , [[Manchester  and [[London  voted by about 60 to 40%  for candidates backed by the management committee of the ''Morning Star''. Chater remained editor of the paper until 1995 when he retired. Control of the newspaper passed from the [[Eurocommunist  leadership of the CPGB to the newly established pro-Soviet [[Communist Party of Britain   CPB .  On the day before the [[Berlin Wall  began to be demolished in 1989, under a headline reading ""GDR unveils reforms package"", the newspaper commented that ""The German Democratic Republic is awakening"", and quoting material supplied by [[East Germany ’s ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party : ""A revolutionary people’s movement has set in motion a process of serious upheaval . . . The aim is dynamically to give socialism more democracy"".<ref name=""Platt""></ref>  Soviet bulk orders ended abruptly in 1989  the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union  had still been buying 6,000 copies every day , and the termination of this order, with only a week's notice, was the cause of ""huge financial disruption"".<ref name=""Deeson"" />   In the 1990s, the publication's circulation fell to 7,000, following the end of the Soviet bulk sales. There were tensions between different CPB factions over control of the paper, and in particular over the successor of Tony Chater as editor. Chief Executive Mary Rosser favoured the news editor, [[Paul Corry   also her son-in-law ; the staff and by the unions favoured Chater's deputy, [[John Haylett , who was installed in February 1995.<ref name=""telegraph.co.uk""/> In 1998 many of its workers - then earning £10,500 a year and with no raise for 11 years - went on strike.<ref name=""Deeson"" /> These strikes were provoked by the sacking by Rosser of Haylett for ""gross misconduct"". During the protest a breakaway from the ''Morning Star'', the ''Workers' Morning Star'' was formed, and published by a small group of journalists who worked for the ''Morning Star'' at the same time. This paper was discontinued before the end of the decade. Haylett was eventually reinstated as editor and the protests stopped, as the circulation saw a moderate increase. ""Our political relationship is still with the Communist Party of Britain"", he said in 2005, pointing out that only about 10% of readers were members of the party, ""but now we represent a broad movement"".<ref name=""Deeson"" />   Although the paper is normally published from Monday to Saturday, the ''Morning Star'' was issued on 13 September 2015, its first ever Sunday edition, to cover [[Labour Party  UK  leadership election, 2015|the election  of [[Jeremy Corbyn  as [[leader of the Labour Party  UK |Leader of the Labour Party .  ===Editorial policy===  Successive annual general meetings of the People's Press Printing Society have agreed that the policy of the paper is founded on ''[[Britain's Road to Socialism '', the programme of the [[Communist Party of Britain .  On international issues, the paper advocates a [[two-state solution  to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict  and calls for Israeli withdrawal from [[Palestinian territories . It was the only daily paper in Britain to oppose the 1999 [[Kosovo War , denouncing military intervention by [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO , and consistently defended Serbian president [[Slobodan Milošević ,<!-- Serbia  1989-97 , Yugoslavia [sic]  1997-2000 . -->  according to other publications. The newspaper also opposed the [[Iraq War . On [[Northern Ireland , the paper takes a pro-[[Irish nationalism  line. News reports from Northern Ireland are described as ""By Our Foreign Desk"".  In its masthead, the paper asserts that it supports peace and [[socialism . It is [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic  and supported the [[No2EU  platform in the [[European Parliament election, 2009  United Kingdom |2009 European Parliament election . The paper was also supportive of [[Brexit|Britain's vote  to leave the EU, saying that ""Anybody who supports the election of a Corbyn government with a mandate to end [[austerity , extend public ownership, redistribute wealth and restructure our economy in the interests of working people needs to explain how this agenda can be implemented in the framework of an EU that bans so much of it"", criticising the referendum campaign as being headed by ""reactionary zealots"" such as [[Nigel Farage , [[Boris Johnson  and [[Michael Gove .<ref name=""Ed13Apr16""></ref> The ''Morning Star'' and the ''Spectator'' were the only newspapers to campaign for an Exit vote in the 1975 referendum.<ref name=""NS29June16""></ref> [[Tony Benn   described as ""the ''[[de facto '' leader of the ""Out"" campaign""<ref name=""NS29June16"" />  campaigned alongside the paper.<ref name=""Ed13Apr16"" />  It is critical of the upper or ruling classes. It defends peaceful protests and civil disobedience and industrial action by workers to improve working conditions and wages. The ''Morning Star'' is concerned with environmental issues and supports environment campaigning groups; it advocates [[unilateral nuclear disarmament . The paper advocates a vote for the Labour Party in most seats, except for the handful in which the Communist Party of Britain has a candidate.<!-- stood only 9 candidates in the 2015 general election, 6 in 2010. -->  The ''Morning Star'' retains ""its reputation for bone-headed [[Stalinism "", according to [[Paul Anderson  journalist |Paul Anderson , a former editor of the [[left-wing politics|left-wing  ''[[Tribune  magazine |Tribune '' weekly. ""It runs articles extolling the virtues of [[single-party  ""socialist"" states on a regular basis – [[North Korea , [[Cuba , [[China , [[Vietnam . Its default position on just about everything happening in the world is that anything any Western power supports – but particularly the [[United States  – must be opposed, which has led to it cheering on [[Putin , [[Hamas , [[Assad  and a lot of other real nasties"".<ref name=""Platt""/>  In December 2016, the newspaper was criticised by Labour MPs led by [[John Woodcock  politician |John Woodcock   ""one of the fiercest critics of British government inaction over aid to the region"", according to ''[[The Huffington Post ''  for its description of the imminent [[Aleppo offensive  November–December 2016 |fall of Aleppo  to Syrian government forces in a front-page headline as a ""liberation"". Labour MP [[Tom Blenkinsop  [[Twitter|tweeted : ""Hard left joining with far right in welcoming dictators ""liberating"" [[Aleppo .

[[Conservative Party  UK |Conservative  MP [[George Osborne  and [[The Guardian|''Guardian''  writer [[Owen Jones  writer |Owen Jones  also attacked the paper's headline.<ref name=""Should've invaded"" /> However, the paper rejected the criticism stating that ""from a purely technical point of view, when a sovereign government reclaims territory previously held by enemy forces, that’s called ""liberation"" whether we like the outcome or not"", while [[Stop the War Coalition  convener [[Lindsey German ,<ref name=""Should've invaded""></ref> and political commentator [[Peter Oborne  defended the ''Star'' reporting of the issue, and questioned the dominant media narrative, respectively. Jeremy Corbyn said he ""disagreed"" with the headline, emphasising that he always advocated a ceasefire and ""a political settlement in Syria"". However, Corbyn said he would still contribute towards the publication in the future.<ref name=""Coates""> </ref>  ===Contributors and staff=== [[File:Jeremy Corbyn.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Contributor [[Jeremy Corbyn   In the first years of the twenty-first century, the paper has carried contributions from [[Uri Avnery , [[John Pilger , [[Green politics|Green  activist [[Derek Wall , ex-[[Mayor of London  [[Ken Livingstone , [[Labour Party  UK |Labour  [[Member of Parliament|MPs  [[Jeremy Corbyn  and [[John McDonnell  politician |John McDonnell , [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green  MP [[Caroline Lucas , former MP [[George Galloway   [[Respect Party|Respect  , the cartoonist [[Martin Rowson , and many trade union general secretaries. Features are contributed by writers from a range of socialist, [[Social democracy|social democratic , [[Green politics|green  and religious perspectives. Despite this, according to then editor [[John Haylett  in 2005: ""things that happened in the Soviet Union 70 years ago are still being used as a stick to beat the ''Morning Star''.""<ref name=""news.bbc.co.uk""/>  On 1 January 2009, [[Bill Benfield  took over as editor of the ''Morning Star''. John Haylett, who had been editor since 1995, took up the post of political editor. Benfield had previously been deputy editor and head of production, but suffered from ill health.  In May 2012, [[Richard Bagley  became editor of the ''Morning Star'', having already worked at the paper in various positions since 2001. In July 2014, he stepped down as editor, with [[Ben Chacko  becoming acting editor,<ref name=""MS0714"">[http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-ca90-Tributes-paid-to-departing-Star-stalwarts#.U-3rz_zh5XE ""Tributes paid to departing Star stalwarts""], ''Morning Star''  website , 28 July 2014</ref> a position in which Chacko was confirmed in May 2015.<ref name=""Greenslade""></ref> The newspaper ""is the most precious and only voice we have in the daily media"", said  then [[backbencher  Labour MP  Jeremy Corbyn at the time of Chacko's formal appointment in May 2015. ""I look forward to working with Ben in promoting socialism and progress"".<ref name=""Greenslade""/>  ===Finances and circulation=== The ''Morning Star'' carries little commercial advertising, with low advertising rates, and the cover price does not cover print and distribution. Consequently, the paper has always been dependent on donations from activists, readers, and trade unions. The paper relies on its ""Star Fund"" appeal  monthly target £16,000 . In its past, the paper received a subsidy from the Soviet Union in the form of bulk orders. In 1981, its circulation was about 36,000, down from the ''Daily Worker''s post-war peak.  In March 2005, ''BBC News Magazine'' reported the ''Morning Star''s circulation as between 13,000 and 14,000, quoting John Haylett's comment ""perhaps only one in 10 of these readers would label themselves as Communists"".<ref name=""news.bbc.co.uk""/> The circulation was thought to be around 10,000 when Ben Chacko took over as editor in mid-2015.  The ''Morning Star'' has also taken a much higher profile at trade union gatherings and within the UK trade union movement, particularly with unions such as [[Unite the Union|Unite , [[GMB  trade union |GMB , UCATT, FBU, Community, CWU, NUM, Durham Miners, Prison Officers and [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers|RMT . Since 2008, the ''Morning Star'' has hired exhibition space at the [[Trades Union Congress , with sponsored copies being handed out to delegates at the TUC, Labour Party Conference, at union conferences and high profile events such as the Tolpuddle Festival and the Durham Miners Gala. The newspaper is also available at independent newsagents and shops such as [[Martin McColl , in local supermarkets such as Budgens, at railway stations and on [[motorway service area s.  During the early morning of 28 July 2008, the offices of the newspaper were damaged by fire, and the edition of 29 July took a reduced form.  On 1 June 2009, the ''Morning Star'' was re-launched. The re-launch included a 16-page edition during the week, and a 24-page weekend edition priced at £1.20 after a rise in its prices in September 2014. There is no Sunday edition of the newspaper. There was also an expanded use of colour pictures and graphics, plus a redesign and a modern layout of the pages. The ''Morning Star'' also redesigned its website. In addition, a number of new and experienced journalists were engaged and the positions of full-time Industrial Correspondent and Lobby Correspondent in the House of Commons were reintroduced.  In November 2011, the ''Morning Star'' launched an urgent appeal to raise £75,000 in order to address a number of funding issues which meant the paper might have gone under by the end of the year.  On Monday 18 June 2012, the ''Morning Star'' moved to printing at two [[Trinity Mirror  print sites in [[Watford  and [[Oldham , which improved distribution of the ''Morning Star'' to all parts of the country, particularly [[Scotland .  ===Online version=== An online version of the paper was launched on 1 April 2004. Initially only some parts of the site were free, including a PDF of the paper's front page, the editorial ""Star Comment"" and all the articles from the culture and sports pages, while features and the actual news were subscription only. On 1 January 2009 this policy was changed, and now all content is freely available online. In April 2012, the paper launched a daily e-edition of the full newspaper, which readers can subscribe to for a charge.  ==Editors== As the ''Daily Worker'': :1930: [[William Rust  journalist |William Rust <ref name=""klugmann""></ref> :1933: [[Jimmy Shields  journalist |Jimmy Shields <ref name=""klugmann"" /> :1935: [[Idris Cox <ref name=""klugmann"" /> :1936: [[Rajani Palme Dutt <ref name=""klugmann"" /> :1938: [[Dave Springhall <ref name=""klugmann"" /> :1939: [[John Ross Campbell <ref name=""klugmann"" /> :1939: [[William Rust  journalist |William Rust <ref name=""klugmann"" /> :1949: [[John Ross Campbell  :1959: [[George Matthews  journalist |George Matthews   Chairs of the editorial board have included [[Hewlett Johnson   clergyman known as 'the Red Dean' of Canterbury , although he was not a member of the CPGB.<ref name=odnb2></ref>  As the ''Morning Star'': :1966: George Matthews :1974: [[Tony Chater <ref name=""TeleobitChater""/> :1995: [[John Haylett  :2009: [[Bill Benfield  :2012: Richard Bagley :2014: [[Ben Chacko   == Notes == ;Notes  ;Citations   ==References== * * *  ==Further reading== * Howe, Mark.

The cards are perpetually maintained as a form of ""wiki page written by one person with a little attitude"".<ref name=""NYT: melding""></ref> As an example, a card about the term ""insurance exchange"" may be reused on stories about the [[Affordable Care Act .<ref name=""NYT: melding"" />  ''Vox'' uses Vox Media's Chorus [[content management system , which enables journalists to easily create articles with complex visual effects and transitions, such as photos that change as the reader scrolls.<ref name=""NYT: melding"" /> Vox Media's properties target educated households with six-figure incomes and a head of house less than 35 years old.<ref name=""NYT: melding"" />  === Video === ''Vox'' has a YouTube channel by the same name where they have regularly posted videos on news and informational subjects since 2014.<ref name=""VoxYTabout""></ref> These videos are accompanied by an article on their website. The themes covered in the videos are usually similar to the themes covered in the regular, written articles on the website. The channel has over 5.2 million subscribers and over one billion views as of early December 2018.<ref name=""VoxYTabout"" /> Content surrounds both current affairs, timeline of certain events, and interesting facts.  In May 2018, ''Vox'' partnered with [[Netflix  to release a weekly TV show called ''[[Explained  TV series |Explained ''.  === Podcasts === ''Vox'' distributes seven podcasts, all hosted by ''Vox'' staff:<ref name=""Podcasts""></ref> * ''The Weeds'' is a twice-weekly [[round table  discussion |roundtable  podcast, hosted by Klein, Yglesias, healthcare-policy correspondent Sarah Kliff, immigration correspondent Dara Lind, and senior politics reporter Jane Coaston focusing on U.S. national news with a focus on the fine details of public policy.<ref name=""Podcasts"" /> * ''The Ezra Klein Show'' is a weekly interview podcast in which Klein interviews guests in politics and media. * ''I Think You're Interesting'' is a weekly interview podcast about the arts, entertainment, and pop culture, hosted by ''Vox''s ""critic at large"" Todd VanDerWerff.<ref name=""Podcasts"" /> * ''Worldly'' is a weekly roundtable podcast focusing on U.S. foreign policy and international affairs, hosted by ''Vox'' foreign-and-security-policy writers Jennifer Williams, Zach Beauchamp, and Alex Ward; [[Yochi Dreazen  also previously hosted.<ref name=""Podcasts"" /> * ''The Impact'' is a weekly narrative podcast hosted by Kliff investigating the effects of policy decisions in practice. * ''Today, Explained'' is a daily podcast, hosted by Sean Ramaswaram, providing short explanations of items in the news.<ref name=""Podcasts"" /> * ''Future Perfect'' is a weekly podcast, hosted by Dylan Matthews, exploring provocative ideas with the potential to radically improve the world, often discussing ideas associated with [[effective altruism .  === Accolades === Original programming by ''Vox'' has been recognized by the [[News & Documentary Emmy Award s, which are presented by the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences . In 2017, the documentary ''2016 Olympics: What Rio Doesn’t Want the World to See'' was nominated in the ""Outstanding News Special"" category, ''Vox Pop'' was nominated in the ""Outstanding Arts, Culture and Entertainment Report"" and ""Outstanding Graphic Design and Art Direction"" categories, and ''The Secret Life of Muslims'' was nominated in the ""Outstanding Short Documentary"" category. In 2018, ''Borders'' was nominated in the ""Outstanding Video Journalism: News"" category, and ''Earworm'' received nominations in the ""Outstanding Graphic Design and Art Direction"" and ""Outstanding New Approaches: Arts, Lifestyle and Culture"" categories.  ==Editorial stance== ''Vox'' takes a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal -leaning editorial stance. ''[[The New York Times '' columnist [[Ross Douthat , writing in 2016, described ''Vox'' as ""mostly liberal"".  == Reception == In March 2014, before it had officially launched, ''Vox'' was criticized by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative  media commentators, including [[Erick Erickson , for a video it had published.  The website's launch received significant media attention.<ref name="":5""></ref> Websites noted that the launch came around the same time as other data and explainer websites like ''[[FiveThirtyEight '' and ''[[The New York Times '' The Upshot. ''Vox'' was described as using [[clickbait -style headlines to enhance shareability and to act as a ""[[Wikipedia  for ongoing news stories"".<ref name="":5"" />  Shortly after it launched, conservative writer [[David Harsanyi  criticized the site's concept of ""explanatory journalism"" in an article in ''[[The Federalist  website |The Federalist '' titled ""How Vox makes us stupid"", arguing that the website selectively chose facts, and that ""explanatory journalism"" inherently leaves out opposing viewpoints and different perspectives. Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry at ''[[The Week '' argued that the website produced ""partisan commentary in question-and-answer disguise"" and criticized the site for having a ""starting lineup [that] was mostly made up of ideological liberals."" ''[[The Week ''s Ryu Spaeth described the site's operations as, ""It essentially takes the news  in other words, what is happening in the world at any given moment in time  and frames it in a way that appeals to its young, liberal audience.""  ''[[The Economist '', commenting on Klein's launching essay ""How politics makes us stupid"", said the website was ""bright and promising"" and the premise behind the site was ""profoundly honourable"", and positively compared the site's mission to [[John Keats 's [[negative capability .<ref name="":4"" /> In December 2014, the website [[Deadspin  wrote a post listing each time ''Vox'' ran a correction for a factual error in an article. In an opinion piece in ''[[The Washington Times '', [[Christopher J. Harper  criticized the site for numerous reporting mistakes.  ''[[The New York Times '' [[David Carr  journalist |David Carr  associated Klein's exit for ''Vox'' with other ""big-name journalists"" leaving newspapers for digital start-ups, such as [[Walter Mossberg  and [[Kara Swisher   of ''[[Recode '' , [[David Pogue , and [[Nate Silver .<ref name=""NYT: joining Vox"" /> In 2015, the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry  presented [[Julia Belluz  the Robert B. Balles Prize for Critical Thinking for her work on ''Vox''.  In December 2018, ''Vox'' received criticism from fans of [[YouTube personality  [[PewDiePie  for a series of articles written by reporter Aja Romano, including one that alleged that PewDiePie had ties to the [[alt-right  and [[white supremacism .<ref name=heavy></ref> Romano has said she had received harassment on [[Twitter , while many of the fans urged PewDiePie to sue ''Vox''.<ref name=heavy />  == Readership == ''Vox'' received 8.2 million unique visitors in July 2014.  In a 2017 interview on [[Nieman Lab , Klein stated: ""We watch our audience data pretty closely, and our audience data does not show or suggest to us that we are overwhelmingly read on one side or the other of the political sphere, which is good...And overall our audience leans a bit left, but it doesn’t lean overwhelmingly so.""  == See also == *  *  *   == References ==   == External links == *     [[Category:2014 establishments in the United States  [[Category:American news websites  [[Category:Internet properties established in 2014  [[Category:Progressivism in the United States  [[Category:Vox Media ","Vox is an American news and opinion website owned by Vox Media.

It is a [[brand  marketed by [[Verizon Media .  The service traces its history to an [[online service  known as [[PlayNET , which hosted multi-player games for the [[Commodore 64 . PlayNET licensed their software to a new service, [[Quantum Link   Q-Link , who went online in November 1985. PlayNET shut down shortly thereafter. The initial Q-Link service was similar to the original PlayNET, but over time Q-Link added many new services. When a new [[IBM PC  client was released, the company focussed on the non-gaming services and launched it under the name America Online. The original Q-Link was shut down on November 1, 1995, while AOL grew to become the largest online service, displacing established players like [[CompuServe  and [[The Source  online service |The Source . By 1995, AOL had about 20 million active users.  AOL was one of the early pioneers of the [[Internet  in the mid-1990s, and the most recognized brand on the web in the United States. It originally [[Internet service provider|provided a dial-up service  to millions of Americans, as well as providing a [[web portal , [[e-mail , [[instant messaging  and later a [[web browser  following its purchase of [[Netscape . In 2001, at the height of its popularity, it purchased the media conglomerate [[Time Warner  in the largest merger in U.S. history. AOL rapidly declined thereafter, partly due to the decline of dial-up and rise of [[broadband . AOL was eventually [[Spin-off  corporate |spun off  from Time Warner in 2009, with [[Tim Armstrong  executive |Tim Armstrong  appointed the new CEO. Under his leadership, the company invested in media brands and advertising technologies.  On June 23, 2015, AOL was acquired by [[Verizon Communications  for $4.4 billion.<ref name=""buyout-cnbc""></ref> In the following months, AOL also made a deal with [[Microsoft .  == History ==  === 1983–1991: Early years === AOL began in 1983, as a short-lived venture called '''Control Video Corporation'''  or '''CVC''' , founded by [[William von Meister . Its sole product was an online service called [[GameLine  for the [[Atari 2600  [[video game console , after von Meister's idea of buying music on demand was rejected by [[Warner Bros. <ref name=""Klein2003""></ref> Subscribers bought a [[modem  from the company for [[United States dollar|US$ 49.95 and paid a one-time US$15 setup fee. GameLine permitted subscribers to temporarily download games and keep track of high scores, at a cost of US$1 per game.<ref name=history></ref> The telephone disconnected and the downloaded game would remain in GameLine's Master Module and playable until the user turned off the console or downloaded another game.  In January 1983, [[Steve Case  was hired as a marketing consultant for Control Video on the recommendation of his brother, investment banker Dan Case. In May 1983, [[Jim Kimsey  became a manufacturing consultant for Control Video, which was near bankruptcy. Kimsey was brought in by his West Point friend [[Frank Caufield , an investor in the company.<ref name=""Klein2003"" /> In early 1985, von Meister left the company.<ref name=Warner></ref>  On May 24, 1985, '''Quantum Computer Services''', an online services company, was founded by Jim Kimsey from the remnants of Control Video, with Kimsey as [[Chief Executive Officer , and [[Marc Seriff  as [[Chief Technology Officer . The technical team consisted of [[Marc Seriff , Tom Ralston, Ray Heinrich, Steve Trus, Ken Huntsman, Janet Hunter, Dave Brown, Craig Dykstra, Doug Coward, and Mike Ficco. In 1987, Case was promoted again to executive vice-president. Kimsey soon began to groom Case to take over the role of CEO, which he did when Kimsey retired in 1991.<ref name=Warner />  Kimsey changed the company's strategy, and in 1985, launched a dedicated online service for [[Commodore 64  and [[Commodore 128|128  computers, originally called [[Quantum Link   ""Q-Link"" for short .<ref name=history /> The Quantum Link software was based on software licensed from [[PlayNET|PlayNet, Inc ,  founded in 1983 by Howard Goldberg and Dave Panzl . The service was different from other online services as it used the computing power of the Commodore 64 and the [[Apple II  rather than just a ""dumb"" terminal. It passed tokens back and forth and provided a fixed price service tailored for home users. In May 1988, Quantum and [[Apple Computer|Apple  launched [[AppleLink  Personal Edition for [[Apple II family|Apple II  and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh  computers. In August 1988, Quantum launched PC Link, a service for [[IBM -compatible [[personal computer|PCs  developed in a joint venture with the [[Tandy Corporation . After the company parted ways with Apple in October 1989, Quantum changed the service's name to America Online.  Case promoted and sold AOL as the online service for people unfamiliar with computers, in contrast to [[CompuServe , which was well established in the technical community.<ref name=Warner />  From the beginning, AOL included [[online game s in its mix of products; many classic and casual games were included in the original PlayNet software system. In the early years of AOL the company introduced many innovative online interactive titles and games, including: * Graphical chat environments [[Habitat  video game |Habitat   1986–1988  and [[Club Caribe   1988  from [[LucasArts . * The first online interactive fiction series [[QuantumLink Serial  by [[Tracy Reed  writer |Tracy Reed   1988 . * [[Quantum Space , the first fully automated [[play-by-mail game   1989–1991 .  === 1991–2006: Internet age, Time Warner merger === [[File:America Online logo.svg|200px|thumb|left|First AOL logo as ""America Online"", used from 1991 to 2005.  In February 1991, AOL for [[DOS  was launched using a [[GeoWorks  interface followed a year later by AOL for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows .<ref name=history /> This coincided with growth in pay-based online services, like [[Prodigy  ISP |Prodigy , [[CompuServe , and [[GEnie . 1991 also saw the introduction of an original [[Dungeons & Dragons  title called ''[[Neverwinter Nights  AOL game |Neverwinter Nights '' from [[Stormfront Studios ; which was one of the first Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games to depict the adventure with graphics instead of text.  During the early 1990s, the average subscription lasted for about 25 months and accounted for $350 in total revenue.<ref name=""quora20101224""></ref> Advertisements invited modem owners to ""Try America Online FREE"", promising free software and trial membership.<ref name=""aol199408""></ref> AOL discontinued [[Quantum Link|Q-Link  and PC Link in late 1994. In September 1993, AOL added [[Usenet  access to its features. This is commonly referred to as the ""[[Eternal September "", as Usenet's cycle of new users was previously dominated by smaller numbers of college and university freshmen gaining access in September and taking a few weeks to acclimate. This also coincided with a new ""[[carpet bombing "" marketing campaign by CMO [[Jan Brandt  to distribute as many free trial AOL trial disks as possible through nonconventional distribution partners. At one point, 50% of the [[CD s produced worldwide had an AOL logo.<ref name=""tc""></ref> AOL quickly surpassed [[GEnie , and by the mid-1990s, it passed [[Prodigy  ISP |Prodigy   which for several years allowed AOL advertising  and [[CompuServe .<ref name=Warner />  Over the next several years, AOL launched services with the [[National Education Association , the [[American Federation of Teachers , ''[[National Geographic  magazine |National Geographic '', the [[Smithsonian Institution , the [[Library of Congress , [[Pearson PLC|Pearson , [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic , [[Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development|ASCD , [[National School Boards Association|NSBA , NCTE, [[Discovery Communications|Discovery Networks , [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner  Education Services  [[CNN Newsroom  , [[NPR , [[The Princeton Review , [[Stanley Kaplan , [[Barron's Educational Series|Barron's , [[Highlights for Kids , the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education , and many other education providers. AOL offered the first real-time homework help service  the Teacher Pager—1990; prior to this, AOL provided homework help bulletin boards , the first service by children, for children  Kids Only Online, 1991 , the first online service for parents  the Parents Information Network, 1991 , the first online courses  1988 , the first omnibus service for teachers  the Teachers' Information Network, 1990 , the first online exhibit  [[Library of Congress , 1991 , the first parental controls, and many other online education firsts.  AOL purchased search engine [[WebCrawler  in 1995, but the next year sold it to [[Excite  in a deal that makes Excite the exclusive search and directory service on AOL. After the deal closed in March 1997, AOL launched its own branded search engine, based on Excite, called NetFind. This was renamed to AOL Search in 1999.  [[File:Nostalgia  7539894906 .jpg|thumb|250px|America Online 2.0 software for Microsoft Windows  1994   AOL charged its users an hourly fee until December 1996, when the company changed to a flat monthly rate of $19.95.<ref name=history /> During this time, AOL connections would be flooded with users trying to get on, and many canceled their accounts due to constant [[busy signal s. A commercial featuring Steve Case telling people AOL was working day and night to fix the problem was made. Within three years, AOL's user base grew to 10 million people. In 1995 AOL was headquartered at 8619 Westwood Center Drive in the [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner CDP  in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated  [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County , Virginia, near the [[Vienna, Virginia|Town of Vienna .  AOL was quickly running out of room in October 1996 for its network at the Fairfax County campus. In mid-1996, AOL moved to 22000 AOL Way in [[Dulles, Virginia|Dulles , unincorporated [[Loudoun County, Virginia  to provide room for future growth. In a five-year landmark agreement with the most popular operating system, AOL was bundled with [[Microsoft Windows|Windows  software.  On March 31, 1996, the short-lived [[eWorld  was purchased by AOL. In 1997, about half of all U.S. homes with Internet access had it through AOL. During this time, AOL's content channels, under [[Jason Seiken , including News, Sports, and Entertainment, experienced their greatest growth as AOL become the dominant online service internationally with more than 34 million subscribers. In November 1998, AOL announced it would acquire [[Netscape , best known for their [[Netscape  browser |web browser , in a major $4.2 billion deal.<ref name=history /> The deal closed on March 17, 1999. Another large acquisition in December 1999 was that of [[MapQuest , for $1.1 billion.  [[File:AOL Time Warner Logo.svg|thumb|left  In January 2000, AOL and [[Time Warner  announced plans to merge, forming AOL Time Warner, Inc. The terms of the deal called for AOL shareholders to own 55% of the new, combined company. The deal closed on January 11, 2001. The new company was led by executives from AOL, SBI, and Time Warner. [[Gerald Levin , who had served as CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company. [[Steve Case  served as Chairman, J. Michael Kelly  from AOL  was the Chief Financial Officer, [[Robert W. Pittman   from AOL  and [[Richard Parsons  businessman |Dick Parsons   from Time Warner  served as Co-Chief Operating Officers. In 2002, [[Jonathan Miller  businessman |Jonathan Miller  became CEO of AOL.<ref name=""henry2002""> ''Note: only the beginning of the news article was available, the remainder behind a paywall.''</ref> The following year, AOL Time Warner dropped the ""AOL"" from its name.  In 2004, along with the launch of AOL 9.0 Optimized, AOL also made available the option of personalized greetings which would enable the user to hear his or her name while accessing basic functions and mail alerts, or while logging in or out. In 2005, AOL broadcast the [[Live 8  concert live over the Internet, and thousands of users downloaded clips of the concert over the following months.  In late 2005, AOL released AOL Safety & Security Center, a bundle of [[McAfee Antivirus , [[Computer Associates|CA  anti-spyware, and proprietary [[Firewall  computing |firewall  and [[Anti-phishing software|phishing protection  software.  News reports in late 2005 identified companies such as [[Yahoo! , [[Microsoft , and [[Google  as candidates for turning AOL into a joint venture. Those plans were abandoned when it was revealed on December 20, 2005 that Google would purchase a 5% share of AOL for $1&nbsp;billion.  === 2006–2009: Rebranding and decline === [[File:AOL old logo.svg|200px|thumb|left|Former AOL logo, used from 2005 to 2009  On April 3, 2006, AOL announced it was retiring the full name America Online; the official name of the service became AOL, and the full name of the [[Time Warner  subdivision became '''AOL''' [[Limited liability company|LLC .<ref name=""pr""></ref> On June 8, 2006, AOL offered a new program called AOL Active Security Monitor, a diagnostic tool which checked the local PC's security status, and recommended additional security software from AOL or [[Download.com . The program rated the computer on a variety of different areas of security and general computer health. Two months later, AOL released [[AOL Active Virus Shield . This software was developed by [[Kaspersky Lab . Active Virus Shield software was free and did not require an AOL account, only an internet email address. The [[Internet service provider|ISP  side of [[AOL Broadband|AOL UK  was bought by [[The Carphone Warehouse  in October 2006 to take advantage of their 100,000 [[Local-loop unbundling|LLU  customers, making [[Carphone Warehouse|The Carphone Warehouse  the biggest LLU provider in the UK.  [[File:Aol subscribers Q201-Q407.png|thumb|right|Decline in AOL U.S. subscribers 2Q 2001 – 2Q 2009, with a significant drop from 2Q 2006 onward.  In August 2006, AOL announced they would give away [[email  accounts and software previously available only to its paying customers provided the customer accessed AOL or AOL.com through a non-AOL-owned access method  otherwise known as ""third party transit"", ""bring your own access"", or ""BYOA"" . The move was designed to reduce costs associated with the ""Walled Garden"" business model by reducing usage of AOL-owned access points and shifting members with high-speed internet access from client-based usage to the more lucrative advertising provider, AOL.com. The change from paid to free was also designed to slow the rate of members canceling their accounts and defecting to [[Microsoft  [[Hotmail , [[Yahoo! , or other free email providers. The other free services included: * AIM  [[AOL Instant Messenger   * AOL Video featured professional content and allowed users to upload videos as well. * AOL Local, comprising its CityGuide, [[Yellow pages|Yellow Pages  and Local Search services to help users find local information like restaurants, local events, and directory listings. * AOL News * AOL My eAddress, a custom [[domain name  for email addresses.  These email accounts could be accessed in a manner similar to other AOL and AIM email accounts. * Xdrive, which was a service offered by AOL, allowed users to back up their files over the Internet.<ref name=""Pogue""> Quote: ""Online backups, where files are shuttled off to the Internet for safekeeping, are suddenly becoming effortless, capacious and even free.""</ref> It was acquired by AOL on August 4, 2005 and closed on December 31, 2008.

The increase was part of an effort to migrate the service's remaining dial-up users to broadband, as the increased price was the same price they had been charging for monthly [[Digital subscriber line|DSL  access.<ref name=""mills""></ref> However, AOL has since started offering their services for $9.95 a month for unlimited dial-up access.<ref name=""AOL""></ref>  On November 16, 2006, [[Randy Falco  succeeded [[Jonathan Miller  businessman |Jonathan Miller  as CEO. In December 2006, AOL closed their last remaining call center in the United States, ""taking the America out of America Online"" according to industry pundits. Service centers based in [[India  and the [[Philippines  continue to this day to provide customer support and technical assistance to subscribers.  [[File:AOLmobile.jpg|thumb|200px|left|An AOL Mobile sign at GSMA Barcelona 2008  On September 17, 2007, AOL announced it was moving one of its corporate headquarters from [[Dulles, Virginia , to [[New York City  and combining its various advertising units into a new subsidiary called Platform A. This action followed several advertising acquisitions, most notably [[Advertising.com , and highlighted the company's new focus on advertising-driven business models. AOL management stressed ""significant operations"" will remain in Dulles, which included the company's access services and modem banks.  In October 2007, AOL announced it would move one of its other headquarters from [[Loudoun County, Virginia , to New York City; it would continue to operate its Virginia offices.<ref name=""GoldfarbHQMove""></ref> As part of the impending move to New York and the restructuring of responsibilities at the Dulles headquarters complex after the Reston move, AOL CEO [[Randy Falco  announced on October 15, 2007 plans to lay off 2,000 employees worldwide by the end of 2007, beginning ""immediately"".<ref name=""LayoffDay""></ref>  The end result was a near 40% layoff across the board at AOL. Most compensation packages associated with the October 2007 layoffs included a minimum of 120 days of severance pay, 60 of which were given in lieu of the 60-day advance notice requirement by provisions of the 1988 Federal [[Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act|WARN Act .<ref name=""LayoffDay"" />  By November 2007, AOL's customer base had been reduced to 10.1&nbsp;million subscribers,<ref name=""custBase""></ref> just narrowly ahead of [[Comcast  and [[AT&T Yahoo! .

Shortly thereafter, on May 28, [[Time Warner  announced it would spin off AOL as an independent company once [[Google 's shares ceased at the end of the fiscal year.  On November 23, AOL unveiled a sneak preview of a new brand identity which has the wordmark ""'''Aol.'''"" superimposed onto canvases created by commissioned artists. The new identity, designed by [[Wolff Olins , was enacted onto all of AOL's services on December 10, the date AOL traded independently for the first time since the Time Warner merger on the [[New York Stock Exchange  under the symbol AOL.  On April 6, 2010, AOL announced plans to shut down or sell Bebo; on June 16, the property was sold to [[Criterion Capital Partners  for an undisclosed amount, believed to be around $10 million.

On April 24, the company launched the [[AOL On  network, a single website for its video output.  In February 2013, AOL reported its fourth quarter revenue of $599.5 million, its first growth in quarterly revenue in 8 years.  In August 2013, Armstrong announced [[Patch Media  would scale back or sell hundreds of its local news sites. Not long afterwards, layoffs began, with up to 500 out of 1,100 positions initially impacted. On January 15, 2014, Patch Media was spun off, with majority ownership being held by Hale Global.<ref name=""Hale""></ref>  By the end of 2014, AOL controlled 0.74% of the global advertising market, well behind industry leader Google's 31.4%.<ref name=BBCbuy />  On January 23, 2014, AOL acquired Gravity, a software startup that tracked users’ online behavior and tailored ads and content based on their interests, for $83 million. The deal, which included roughly 40 Gravity employees and their personalization technology, was CEO Tim Armstrong's fourth largest deal since taking over the company in 2009. Later that year, AOL also acquired Vidible, which developed technology to help websites run video content from other publishers, and help video publishers sell their content to these websites. The deal, which was announced December 1, 2014, was reportedly worth roughly $50 million.  On July 16, 2014, AOL earned an [[Emmy Award|Emmy  nomination for the AOL original series, The Future Starts Here, in the News and Documentary category. This came days after AOL earned its first [[Primetime Emmy Award  nomination for ''[[Park Bench with Steve Buscemi '' in the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Variety Series|Outstanding Short Form Variety Series  category, which later won the award. Created and hosted by [[Tiffany Shlain , the series focused on human's relationship with technology and featured episodes such as The Future of Our Species, Why We Love Robots, and A Case for Optimism.  === 2015–present: Division of Verizon === [[File:AOL_Silicon_Valley_office.jpg|thumb|left|AOL's Silicon Valley branch office.  On May 12, 2015, [[Verizon  announced plans to buy AOL for $50 per share in a deal valued at $4.4 billion. The transaction was completed on June 23. [[Tim Armstrong  executive |Armstrong , who continued to lead the firm following regulatory approval, called the deal the logical next step for AOL. ""If you look forward five years, you're going to be in a space where there are going to be massive, global-scale networks, and there's no better partner for us to go forward with than Verizon."" he said. ""It's really not about selling the company today. It's about setting up for the next five to 10 years.""<ref name=""buyout-cnbc"" />  Analyst David Bank said he thought the deal made sense for Verizon.<ref name=""buyout-cnbc"" />  The deal will broaden Verizon's advertising sales platforms and increase its video production ability through websites such as ''[[The Huffington Post '', [[TechCrunch , and [[Engadget .<ref name=BBCbuy></ref> However, Craig Moffett said it was unlikely the deal would make a big difference to Verizon's bottom line.<ref name=""buyout-cnbc"" /> AOL had about two million dial-up subscribers at the time of the buyout.<ref name=BBCbuy />  The announcement caused AOL's stock price to rise 17%, while Verizon's stock price dropped slightly.<ref name=""buyout-cnbc"" />  Shortly before the Verizon purchase, on April 14, 2015, AOL launched ONE by AOL, a digital marketing programmatic platform that unifies buying channels and audience management platforms to track and optimize campaigns over multiple screens. Later that year, on September 15, AOL expanded the product with ONE by AOL: Creative, which is geared towards creative and media agencies to similarly connect marketing and ad distribution efforts.  On May 8, 2015, AOL reported its first quarter revenue of $625.1 million, $483.5 million of which came from advertising and related operations, marking a 7% increase from Q1 2014. Over that year, the AOL Platforms division saw a 21% increase in revenue, but a drop in adjusted OIBDA due to increased investments in the company's video and programmatic platforms.  On June 29, 2015, AOL announced a deal with [[Microsoft  to take over the majority of its digital advertising business. Under the pact, as many as 1,200 Microsoft employees involved with the business will be transferred to AOL, and the company will take over the sale of display, video, and mobile ads on various Microsoft platforms in nine countries, including Brazil, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, [[Google Search  will be replaced on AOL properties with [[Bing  search engine |Bing —which will display advertising [[Bing Ads|sold by Microsoft . Both advertising deals are subject to [[affiliate marketing  [[revenue sharing .<ref name=nyt-aolads></ref><ref name=wsj-bingaolads></ref>  On July 22, 2015, AOL received two News and Documentary Emmy nominations, one for MAKERS in the Outstanding Historical Programming category, and the other for True Trans With [[Laura Jane Grace , which documented the story of Laura Jane Grace, a [[transgender  musician best known as the founder, lead singer, songwriter and guitarist of the punk rock band [[Against Me! , and her decision to come out publicly and overall transition experience.  On September 3, 2015, AOL agreed to buy [[Millennial Media  for US$238 million. On October 23, 2015, AOL completed the acquisition.  On October 1, 2015, Go90, a free ad-supported mobile video service aimed at young adult and teen viewers that Verizon owns and AOL oversees and operates launched its content publicly after months of beta testing.<ref name="":0""></ref> The initial launch line-up included content from [[Comedy Central , [[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post , [[Nerdist News , [[Univision  News, [[Vice Media|Vice , [[ESPN  and [[MTV .<ref name="":0"" />  On January 25, 2016, AOL expanded its ONE platform by introducing ONE by AOL: Publishers, which combines six previously separate technologies to offer various publisher capabilities such as customizing video players, offering premium ad experience to boost visibility, and generating large video libraries. The announcement was made in tandem with AOL's acquisition of AlephD, a Paris-based startup focused on publisher analytics of ad price tracking based on historical data. AOL announced AlephD would be a part of the ONE by AOL: Publishers platform.  On April 20, 2016, AOL acquired virtual reality studio [[RYOT  to bring immersive 360 degree video and VR content to The Huffington Post's global audience across desktop, mobile, and apps.  In July 2016, Verizon Communications announced its intent to purchase the core internet business of [[Yahoo! . Verizon tentatively plans to merge AOL with Yahoo into a new company called ""[[Oath Inc.|Oath "".<ref name=""verge-oath""></ref>  In April 2018, [[Oath Inc.  sold [[Moviefone  to [[MoviePass  Parent [[Helios and Matheson Analytics .  == Products and services == === Content ===  As of 2019, following media brands became subsidiary of AOL's parent [[Verizon Media . * ''[[HuffPost '' * [[Engadget  * Autoblog<ref name="":1""></ref> * [[TechCrunch  * [[Cambio.com|Cambio  * [[MapQuest   AOL's content contributors consists of over 20,000 bloggers, including politicians, celebrities, academics, and policy experts, who contribute on a wide range of topics making news.  In addition to mobile-optimized web experiences, AOL produces mobile applications for existing AOL properties like Autoblog, Engadget, The Huffington Post, TechCrunch, AIM, MapQuest, and products such as Alto, Pip, and Vivv.  === Advertising === AOL has a global portfolio of media brands and advertising solutions across mobile, desktop, and TV. Solutions include brand integration and sponsorships through its in-house branded content arm, Partner Studio by AOL, as well as data and programmatic offerings through ad technology stack, ONE by AOL.  AOL acquired a number of businesses and technologies help to form ONE by AOL. These acquisitions included [[AdapTV  in 2013 and Convertro, Precision Demand, and Vidible in 2014. ONE by AOL is further broken down into ONE by AOL for Publishers  formerly Vidible, AOL On Network and Be On for Publishers  and ONE by AOL for Advertisers, each of which have several sub-platforms.  On 10 September 2018, AOL's parent company Oath consolidated Yahoo BrightRoll, One by AOL and Yahoo Gemini to ‘simplify’ adtech service by launching a single advertising proposition dubbed Oath Ad Platforms.  === Membership === AOL offers a range of integrated products and properties including communication tools, mobile apps and services and subscription packages. * [[Dial-up Internet access  – According to AOL quarterly earnings report May 8, 2015, 2.1 million people still use AOL's dial-up service. * [[AOL Mail  – AOL Mail is AOL's proprietary email client. It is fully integrated with AIM and links to news headlines on AOL content sites. * [[AOL Instant Messenger   AIM  – was AOL's proprietary instant-messaging tool. It was released in 1997. It lost market share to competition in the instant messenger market such as Google Chat, Facebook Messenger, and Skype. It also included a video-chat service, AV by AIM. On December 15, 2017, AOL discontinued AIM. * AOL Plans — AOL Plans offers three online safety and assistance tools: ID protection, data security and a general online technical assistance service.  === AOL Desktop ===  </ref> Windows <br />1.7  macOS  | latest release date    = August 10, 2015 | latest preview version = 11.0.522<ref name=""beta.aol.com""></ref> | latest preview date    = July 11, 2016 | programming language   = [[C++  | operating system       = [[Microsoft Windows XP  or later, [[Mac OS X Tiger|Mac OS X 10.4 .8 or later | genre                  = [[Internet Suite  | license                = [[Proprietary software|Proprietary  | website                =     '''AOL Desktop''' is an internet suite produced by AOL that integrates a [[web browser , a [[Media player  application software |media player  and an [[instant messenger  client.<ref name=""daol.aol.com"" /> Version 10.X was based on [[AOL OpenRide , it is an upgrade from such. The [[macOS  version is based on [[WebKit .  AOL Desktop version 10.X was different from previous [[AOL Explorer|AOL browsers  and AOL Desktop versions. Its features are focused on web browsing as well as [[email . For instance, one does not have to sign into AOL in order to use it as a regular browser. In addition, non-AOL email accounts can be accessed through it. Primary buttons include ""MAIL"", ""IM"", and several shortcuts to various web pages. The first two require users to sign in, but the shortcuts to web pages can be used without authentication. AOL Desktop version 10.X was late marked as unsupported in favor of supporting the AOL Desktop 9.X versions.  Version 9.8 was released, replacing the Internet Explorer components of the internet browser with [[Chromium Embedded Framework|CEF   Chromium Embedded Framework  to give users an improved web browsing experience closer to that of [[Google Chrome|Chrome   Version 11 of AOL Desktop, currently in Beta, is a total rewrite but maintains a similar user interface to the previous 9.8.X series of releases.<ref name=""beta.aol.com"" />  In 2017, a new paid version called AOL Desktop Gold was released, available for $4.99 per month after trial. It replaced the previous free version.  == Criticism == [[File:NoMoreAolCDs in Aachen.JPG|thumb|200px|A collection of AOL CDs sent to a student dormitory in Germany, 2002  In its earlier incarnation as a ""[[Closed platform|walled garden "" community and service provider, AOL received criticism for its community policies, terms of service, and customer service. Prior to 2006, AOL was known for its direct mailing of CD-ROMs and 3½"" floppy disks containing its software. The disks were distributed in large numbers; at one point, half of the CDs manufactured worldwide had AOL logos on them. The marketing tactic was criticized for its environmental cost, and AOL CDs were recognized as ''[[PC World ''s most annoying tech product.  === Community leaders === Prior to mid-2005, AOL used [[virtual volunteering|online volunteers  called [[AOL Community Leader Program|Community Leaders , or CLs, to monitor chatrooms, message boards, and libraries.  AOL's use of [[virtual volunteering|remote volunteers  dated back to the establishment of its [[Quantum Link  service in 1985.  Most content maintenance was performed by partner and internal employees.  Community leaders were recruited for some content design and maintenance, for which they used a proprietary language and interface called RAINMAN.  Other community leaders hosted chat rooms and provided online help.  During the time that AOL customers paid by the hour, chat room hosts were compensated in free online time for each hour they worked, though any banked hours became worthless once fixed-rate payment was introduced.  Two former community leaders, Brian Williams of Dallas and Kelly Hallissey of New York filed a class action lawsuit against AOL, citing violations of [[United States labor law|U.S. labor laws  in its use of community leaders.  The lawsuit was filed in the United States Federal Courthouse, New York City on May 25, 1999, and was followed shortly by the dismissal of all community leaders under the age of 18 years, as well as a reorganization of the community leader program as a whole. The [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor  was also investigating AOL's alleged labor law violations, but came to no conclusion, closing their investigation in 2001.<ref name=""cisn""></ref>  AOL began drastically reducing the responsibilities and privileges of its volunteers in 2000.  The program was eventually ended on June 8, 2005.  Current Community Leaders at the time were offered 12 months of credit on their accounts in thanks for their service.  Within one decade of the class action lawsuit being filed, the class had grown to over 6,000 members, comprising the largest class action lawsuit ever filed against an internet based company.  Currently it is the third largest class ever involved in any lawsuit on a federal level in the United States, affecting ultimately the employment eligibility of individuals in an online environment.  In February 2010, a settlement was approved by the Courts in the class action suit. The settlement included a US$15&nbsp;million payment. This payment was then divided into thirds, the first of which was attorney and legal fees. Five million was then divided among the included members of the class which consisted of more than 7,000 individual former Community Leaders. The final five million dollars was donated to charities hand picked by Hallissey and Williams, and then approved by the Courts for distribution.  One such charity, the Remote Area Medical Foundation  www.ramusa.org , received payments in excess of US$1.2&nbsp;million for the provision of medical services, supplies and medication for those in need within the more rural areas of the United States and beyond.  Prior to the 1999 class action lawsuit, the community leaders were informed of a change in compensation for duties performed by AOL.  Community leaders would be charged a reduced rate per month for their accounts, and would no longer be given unlimited access without invoice.  During this live announcement via an online meeting of all community leaders in a virtual arena, Brian Williams of Dallas led many community leaders in a virtual ""strike"" or ""sit-in"" to protest the new charges the community leaders were now being asked to pay.  This protest or strike is noted as the first of its kind for an online environment and was nicknamed for the row of the arena it was held in: Row 800.  Following the protest, AOL terminated the online working relationship between itself and several of the Community Leaders involved.  Quickly following the release of these community leaders, each was reinstated, with the  exception of Williams, due to his role in the protest.  During this time, Williams' role on AOL was that of Guide XNT  Guide Program , CB Naked  Crystal Ball forum , VnV Naked  iVillage's Vices and Virtues Forum  and JCommBrian  Jewish Community Online Forum .  === Billing disputes === AOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a class action lawsuit. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute  thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes . AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won  some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP . AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.  AOL was sued by the [[Ohio Attorney General  in October 2003 for improper billing practices. The case was settled on June 8, 2005. AOL agreed to resolve any consumer [[Consumer complaint|complaints  filed with the [[Ohio  AG's office. In December 2006, AOL agreed to provide [[restitution  to Florida consumers to settle the case filed against them by the [[Florida Attorney General .<ref name=""BBB-AOL""></ref>  === Account cancellation === Many customers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing. In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, the [[New York Attorney General 's office began an inquiry of AOL's customer service policies. The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to [[Customer retention|retain  or ""save"" subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers' wishes, or without their consent. Under the scheme, customer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or ""save"" half of the people who called to cancel service. For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or ""save"" percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum ""save"" rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.  On August 24, 2005, America Online agreed to pay $1.25&nbsp;million to the state of New York and reformed its customer service procedures. Under the agreement, AOL would no longer require its customer service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus.<ref name=""BBB-AOL""/> However the agreement only covered people in the state of New York.<ref name=""pcworld.com""></ref>  On June 13, 2006, Vincent Ferrari documented his account cancellation phone call in a blog post, stating he had switched to broadband years earlier. In the recorded phone call, the AOL representative refused to cancel the account unless the 30-year-old Ferrari explained why AOL hours were still being recorded on it. Ferrari insisted that AOL software was not even installed on the computer. When Ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless, the AOL representative asked to speak with Ferrari's father, for whom the account had been set up. The conversation was aired on CNBC. When CNBC reporters tried to have an account on AOL cancelled, they were hung up on immediately and it ultimately took more than 45 minutes to cancel the account.  On July 19, 2006, AOL's entire [[Customer retention|retention  manual was released on the Internet.  On August 3, 2006, [[Time Warner  announced that the company would be dissolving AOL's retention centers due to its profits hinging on $1&nbsp;billion in cost cuts. The company estimated that it would lose more than six million subscribers over the following year.  === Direct marketing of disks === [[File:AOL promotional CDs in Canada.jpg|thumb|A few promotional [[CD-ROM s distributed in Canada.  Prior to 2006, AOL was infamous for the unsolicited mass [[direct mail  of 3½"" [[floppy disks  and [[CD-ROM s containing their software. They were the most frequent user of this marketing tactic, and received criticism for the environmental cost of the campaign. According to ''PC World'', in the 1990s ""you couldn't open a magazine  ''PC World'' included  or your mailbox without an AOL disk falling out of it"".<ref name=""pcworld.com""/>  The mass distribution of these disks was seen as wasteful by the public and led to protest groups. One such was No More AOL CDs, a web-based effort by two IT workers to collect one million disks with the intent to return the disks to AOL.<ref name=""nomore""/>  The website was started in August 2001, and an estimated 410,176 CDs were collected by August 2007 when the project was shut down.<ref name=""nomore"">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070820184342/http://www.nomoreaolcds.com/ Internet Archive Wayback Machine 2007 Aug 20 archive of NoMoreAOLCDs.com main page]. Web.archive.org  August 20, 2007 . Retrieved on July 8, 2011.</ref>  === Software === * In 2000, AOL was served with an $8&nbsp;billion lawsuit alleging that its AOL 5.0 software caused significant difficulties for users attempting to use third-party Internet service providers. The lawsuit sought damages of up to $1000 for each user that had downloaded the software cited at the time of the lawsuit. AOL later agreed to a settlement of $15&nbsp;million, without admission of wrongdoing. The AOL software then was given a feature called AOL Dialer, or AOL Connect on . This feature allowed users to connect to the ISP without running the full interface. This allowed users to use only the applications they wish to use, especially if they do not favor the AOL Browser. * AOL 9.0 was once identified by [[Stopbadware  as being ''under investigation'' for installing additional software without disclosure, and modifying browser preferences, toolbars, and icons. However, as of the release of AOL 9.0 VR  Vista Ready  on January 26, 2007, it was no longer considered badware due to changes AOL made in the software.  === Usenet newsgroups === When AOL gave clients access to [[Usenet  in 1993, they hid at least one newsgroup in standard list view: ''alt.aol-sucks''. AOL did list the newsgroup in the alternative description view, but changed the description to ""Flames and complaints about America Online"". With AOL clients swarming [[Usenet  newsgroups, the old, existing user base started to develop a strong distaste for both AOL and its clients, referring to the new state of affairs as [[Eternal September .  AOL discontinued access to Usenet on June 25, 2005. No official details were provided as to the cause of decommissioning Usenet access, except providing users the suggestion to access Usenet services from a third-party, [[Google Groups . AOL then provided community-based [[Internet Forum|message boards  in lieu of Usenet.  === Terms of Service  TOS  === AOL has a detailed set of guidelines and expectations for users on their service, known as the [[Terms of Service   TOS, also known as Conditions of Service, or COS in the UK . It is separated into three different sections: ''Member Agreement'', ''Community Guidelines'' and ''Privacy Policy''. All three agreements are presented to users at time of registration and digital acceptance is achieved when they access the AOL service. During the period when volunteer chat room hosts and board monitors were used, chat room hosts were given a brief online training session and test on Terms of Service violations.  There have been many complaints over rules that govern an AOL user's conduct. Some users disagree with the TOS, citing the guidelines are too strict to follow coupled with the fact the TOS may change without users being made aware. A considerable cause for this was likely due to alleged censorship of user-generated content during the earlier years of growth for AOL.  === Certified email === In early 2005, AOL stated its intention to implement a [[certified email  system called Goodmail, which will allow companies to send email to users with whom they have pre-existing business relationships, with a visual indication that the email is from a trusted source and without the risk that the email messages might be blocked or stripped by [[spam filter s.  This decision drew fire from [[MoveOn , which characterized the program as an ""email tax"", and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF , which characterized it as a shakedown of non-profits.  A website called Dearaol.com was launched, with an online petition and a blog that garnered hundreds of signatures from people and organizations expressing their opposition to AOL's use of Goodmail.  [[Esther Dyson  defended the move in an editorial in ''[[The New York Times '', saying ""I hope Goodmail succeeds, and that it has lots of competition. I also think it and its competitors will eventually transform into services that more directly serve the interests of mail recipients. Instead of the fees going to Goodmail and EON, they will also be shared with the individual recipients.""  Tim Lee of the Technology Liberation Front posted an article that questioned the EFF's adopting a confrontational posture when dealing with private companies. Lee's article cited a series of discussions on [[Declan McCullagh 's Politechbot mailing list on this subject between the EFF's Danny O'Brien and antispammer Suresh Ramasubramanian, who has also compared the EFF's tactics in opposing Goodmail to tactics used by Republican political strategist [[Karl Rove . [[Spamassassin  developer Justin Mason posted some criticism of the EFF's and Moveon's ""going overboard"" in their opposition to the scheme.  The dearaol.com campaign lost momentum and disappeared, with the last post to the now defunct dearaol.com blog—""AOL starts the shakedown"" being made on May 9, 2006.  [[Comcast , who also used the service, announced on its website that Goodmail had ceased operations and as of February 4, 2011 they no longer used the service.  === Search data ===   On August 4, 2006, AOL released a compressed text file on one of its websites containing 20 million search [[Index term|keywords  for over 650,000 users over a 3-month period between March 1, 2006 and May 31, intended for research purposes. AOL pulled the file from public access by August 7, but not before its wide distribution on the Internet by others. Derivative research, titled ''A Picture of Search'' was published by authors Pass, Chowdhury and Torgeson for The First International Conference on Scalable Information Systems.  The data were used by websites such as AOLstalker for entertainment purposes, where users of AOLstalker are encouraged to judge AOL clients based on the humorousness of personal details revealed by search behavior.  === User list exposure === In 2003, Jason Smathers, an AOL employee, was convicted of stealing America Online's 92 million screen names and selling them to a known spammer. Smathers pled guilty to conspiracy charges in 2005.<ref name=""msnbc.msn.com"">, August 17, 2005</ref><ref name=""TSG-PairNabbed""></ref> Smathers pled guilty to violations of the US [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 . He was sentenced in August 2005 to 15 months in prison; the sentencing judge also recommended Smathers be forced to pay $84,000 in restitution, triple the $28,000 that he sold the addresses for.  === AOL's Computer Checkup ""scareware"" === On February 27, 2012 a [[class action lawsuit  was filed against [[Support.com , Inc. and partner [[AOL, Inc.  The lawsuit alleged Support.com and AOL's Computer Checkup ""[[scareware ""  which uses software developed by Support.com  misrepresented that their software programs would identify and resolve a host of technical problems with computers, offered to perform a free “scan,” which often found problems with users' computers. The companies then offered to sell software—for which AOL allegedly charged $4.99 a month and Support.com $29—to remedy those problems.<ref name=MediaPost></ref> Both AOL, Inc. and Support.com, Inc. settled on May 30, 2013 for $8.5 million. This included $25.00 to each valid class member and $100,000 each to [[Consumer Watchdog  and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation . Judge [[Jacqueline Scott Corley  wrote: “Distributing a portion of the [funds] to Consumer Watchdog will meet the interests of the silent class members because the organization will use the funds to help protect consumers across the nation from being subject to the types of fraudulent and misleading conduct that is alleged here,” and “EFF’s mission includes a strong consumer protection component, especially in regards to online protection.”<ref name=MediaPost/>  AOL continues to market ''Computer Checkup''. It is not clear if this latest ''Computer Checkup'' continues to use [[scareware  techniques.  === NSA Prism program === Following media reports about [[PRISM  surveillance program |PRISM , NSA's massive electronic [[Mass surveillance|surveillance program , in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including AOL. According to leaks of said program, AOL joined the PRISM program in 2011.  === Hosting of user profiles changed, then discontinued === At one time, most AOL users had an online ""profile"" hosted by the [[AOL Hometown  service.  When AOL Hometown was discontinued, users had to create a new profile on [[Bebo .  This was an unsuccessful attempt to create a social network that would compete with Facebook.  When the value of Bebo decreased to a tiny fraction of the $850 million AOL paid for it, users were forced to recreate their profiles yet again, on a new service called [[AOL Lifestream .  AOL took the decision to shut down Lifestream on February 24, 2017, and gave users one month's notice to save off photos and videos that had been uploaded to Lifestream.  Following the shutdown, AOL no longer provides any option for hosting user profiles.  During the Hometown/Bebo/Lifestream era, another user's profile could be displayed by clicking the ""Buddy Info"" button in the AOL Desktop software.  After the shutdown of Lifestream, clicking ""Buddy Info"" does something that provides no information whatsoever about the selected buddy:  it causes the [[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM  home page  www.aim.com  to be displayed.  == See also ==  * [[List of S&P 400 companies  * [[Adrian Lamo  – Inside-AOL.com * [[AOL Explorer  * [[AOL Radio  * [[AOL RED  * [[AOHell  * [[ART image file format  .art * [[Comparison of webmail providers  * [[Dot-com bubble  * [[List of acquisitions by AOL  * [[Live365  * [[Sessions@AOL  * [[Truveo  * [[David Shing    == References ==    == External links == <!-- Per [[WP:ELMINOFFICIAL , choose one official website only -->  *         [[Category:AOL|   [[Category:Companies based in Dulles, Virginia  [[Category:Companies based in New York City  [[Category:Companies established in 2009  [[Category:Companies established in 1983  [[Category:Companies formerly listed on the New York Stock Exchange  [[Category:Online service providers  [[Category:Internet service providers of the United States  [[Category:Internet services supporting OpenID  [[Category:Former Time Warner subsidiaries  [[Category:Web service providers  [[Category:Pre–World Wide Web online services  [[Category:Companies in the PRISM network  [[Category:1983 establishments in the United States  [[Category:Web portals  [[Category:Verizon Media  [[Category:2015 mergers and acquisitions ","AOL  stylized as Aol., formerly a company known as AOL Inc. and originally known as America Online  is an American web portal and online service provider based in New York City. It is a brand marketed by Verizon Media. The service traces its history to an online service known as PlayNET, which hosted multi-player games for the Commodore 64. PlayNET licensed their software to a new service, Quantum Link  Q-Link , who went online in November 1985. PlayNET shut down shortly thereafter. The initial Q-Link service was similar to the original PlayNET, but over time Q-Link added many new services. When a new IBM PC client was released, the company focussed on the non-gaming services and launched it under the name America Online. The original Q-Link was shut down on November 1, 1995, while AOL grew to become the largest online service, displacing established players like CompuServe and The Source. By 1995, AOL had about 20 million active users.AOL was one of the early pioneers of the Internet in the mid-1990s, and the most recognized brand on the web in the United States. It originally provided a dial-up service to millions of Americans, as well as providing a web portal, e-mail, instant messaging and later a web browser following its purchase of Netscape. In 2001, at the height of its popularity, it purchased the media conglomerate Time Warner in the largest merger in U.S. history. AOL rapidly declined thereafter, partly due to the decline of dial-up and rise of broadband. AOL was eventually spun off from Time Warner in 2009, with Tim Armstrong appointed the new CEO. Under his leadership, the company invested in media brands and advertising technologies. On June 23, 2015, AOL was acquired by Verizon Communications for $4.4 billion. In the following months, AOL also made a deal with Microsoft."

Today its stated mission is to inform and educate policy makers about events and trends, which it regards as being of current strategic importance to the United States. Jamestown publishes numerous publications that focus on China, Russia, Eurasia, and global terrorism.  ==Founding and mission== The Jamestown Foundation was founded in 1984 after [[Arkady Shevchenko , the highest-ranking [[Soviet Union|Soviet  official ever to defect when he left his position as [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations , defected in 1978. [[William Geimer , an American lawyer, had been working closely with Shevchenko, and established the foundation as a vehicle to promote the writings of the former Soviet diplomat and those of [[Ion Pacepa , a former top [[Romania n intelligence officer; with the help of the foundation, both defectors published bestselling books.<ref name=""about"">Jamestown Foundation, [http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/ Origins]</ref> The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA  Director [[William J. Casey  helped back the formation of The Jamestown Foundation, agreeing with its complaints that the U.S. intelligence community did not provide sufficient funding of Soviet bloc defectors.<ref name=""h""/>  The foundation, initially also dedicated to supporting Soviet dissidents, enabled the defectors from the [[Eastern Bloc  to earn extra money by lecturing and writing.<ref name=""fs""></ref>  According to its website: ""The mission of the Jamestown Foundation is to inform and educate policy makers and the broader policy community about events and trends in those societies which are strategically or tactically important to the United States and which frequently restrict access to such information. Utilizing indigenous and primary sources, Jamestown's material is delivered without political bias, filter or agenda. It is often the only source of information which should be, but is not always, available through official or intelligence channels, especially in regard to Eurasia and terrorism."" The Foundation describes its ""unique ability to elicit information from those who have first-hand experience with the regimes and groups that threaten U.S. national security"".<ref name=""about""/> It claims to have ""contributed directly to the spread of [[democracy  and [[Civil liberties|personal freedom  in the former Communist Bloc countries.""  == Board of directors == In the past, Jamestown's board of directors has included Dr. [[Zbigniew Brzezinski , former [[National Security Advisor  United States |National Security Advisor  to [[President of the United States|U.S. President  [[Jimmy Carter . Jamestown's current board includes [[Brookings Institution  Senior Fellow Bruce Riedel, who has served in the [[Bill Clinton  White House and in 2009 was tasked by President [[Barack Obama  to overhaul U.S. policy on Afghanistan and Pakistan.  As of 2010, the foundation's current board includes [[General Michael V. Hayden , [[Bruce Riedel , [[Carlton W. Fulford Jr. , [[Kathleen Troia McFarland , [[Bruce Hoffman , [[James H. Burnley IV  and [[Frank Keating , while the Jamestown's fellows included [[David Satter , [[Michael Scheuer   let go in 2009, he claims he was fired because of his criticism of the [[Israel – United States relations|U.S.-Israeli relations  , [[Vladimir Socor , [[Willy Lam|Willy Wo-Lap Lam , a Hong Kong-based China specialist, and Stephen Ulph, a leading expert on [[Jihadist  ideology.  == Praise == On December 8, 2011, Ambassador [[Daniel Benjamin , [[State Department  [[Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism|Counterterrorism Coordinator  for the Obama administration praised Jamestown for its research and analysis of terrorism issues. In his keynote address given at Jamestown's Fifth Annual Terrorism Conference, Amb. Benjamin remarked: ""Because of its [Jamestown's] commitment to serious scholarship and analysis on terrorism issues, I can't think of a more appropriate place to do an end-of-year reckoning on [[Al-Qaeda  – an assessment that is particularly timely after such a remarkable year.""  == Current activities == Currently, its primary focus is on [[China , [[Eurasia , [[Russia  and global [[terrorism . As of 2008, its publications were '''Eurasia Daily Monitor''', '''Global Terrorism Analysis''', '''China Brief''', '''North Caucasus Weekly''',  formerly '''[[Chechnya  Weekly'''  and '''Recent From Turkey'''. Previous publications included '''Eurasia Security Trends''', '''Fortnight in Review''', '''[[North Korea  Review''', '''Russia and Eurasia Review''', '''Russia's Week''', '''Spotlight on Terror''', '''Terrorism Focus''' and '''Terrorism Monitor'''. Along with these publications, Jamestown produces occasional reports and books.  ==Nikolai Getman collection== The foundation hosted Russian artist [[Nikolai Getman 's paintings of [[Gulag  camps. Getman was imprisoned for eight years by the Soviet regime for participating in [[anti-Soviet propaganda  as a result of a caricature of [[Stalin  that one of his friends had drawn on a cigarette box. He survived, and for four decades he secretly labored at creating a visual record of the Gulag system.<ref name=""G"">[http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/ Getman] Retrieved on November 9, 2010</ref> In September 2009, the Jamestown Foundation transferred the Getman collection to the [[Heritage Foundation .  ==Media coverage== An article published in The Jamestown Foundation publication ''China Brief'' was credited by a Taiwanese newspaper as prompting the Taiwanese government to conduct a review of the island's defense strategy. According to a May 5, 2010 report in the Taipei-based newspaper ''[[United Daily News '', the ''China Brief'' article, ""Taiwan's Navy: Able to Deny Command of the Sea?"", published on April 16, 2010 written by James Holmes and Toshi Yoshihara at the U.S. [[Naval War College , was reportedly the reason why Taiwanese President [[Ma Ying-jeou  recently directed the Ministry of National Defense to re-evaluate the country's naval strategy. ''China Brief'' editor L.C. Russell Hsiao noted that this development was a major achievement for the publication and attests to the range and impact it has on the policy making community. Published since May 2001, China Brief has a global readership of nearly 8,000 subscribers and is widely read by defense and foreign policy experts around the world, particularly policymakers in the United States.  ==Criticism==  The Jamestown Foundation has been criticized by the [[Institute for Policy Studies  for advancing a conservative agenda.<ref name=""h""></ref>  In 2009 Russian government accused the research institute of spreading anti-Russian propaganda by hosting a debate on violence in the Russia's turbulent region of [[Ingushetia . According to a statement by the Foreign Ministry of Russia: ""Organisers again and again resorted to deliberately spreading slander about the situation in Chechnya and other republics of the Russian [[North Caucasus  using the services of supporters of terrorists and pseudo-experts. Speakers were given carte blanche to spread extremist propaganda, incite ethnic and inter-religious discord.""<ref name=""reu""></ref> The Jamestown Foundation responded by saying that Russia felt threatened by it and was trying to intimidate it. Foundation president Glen Howard claimed that ""they're intimidated by the power of the free word and this goes against the state manipulation of the [[Freedom of the press in Russia|media in Russia .""<ref name=""reu""/>  == References ==   ==External links== * *[http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/1507 Jamestown Foundation profile on Right Web]   [[Category:Foreign policy and strategy think tanks in the United States  [[Category:Think tanks established in 1984  [[Category:Charities based in Washington, D.C.

Until September 2011, the paper described itself on the banner at the top of every newspaper as ""free from party political bias, free from proprietorial influence"". It tends to take a pro-market stance on economic issues.<ref name=""Wilby""></ref>  The daily edition was named ''National Newspaper of the Year'' at the 2004 [[British Press Awards .   In June 2015, it had an average daily circulation of just below 58,000, 85 per cent down from its 1990 peak, while the Sunday edition had a circulation of just over 97,000.<ref name=""BBC ind stop""/>  ==History==  ===1986 to 1990=== Launched in 1986, the first issue of ''The Independent'' was published on 7 October in [[broadsheet  format.<ref name=""Griffiths"">Dennis Griffiths  ed.  ''The Encyclopedia of the British Press, 1422–1992'', London & Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1992, p. 330</ref> It was produced by Newspaper Publishing plc and created by [[Andreas Whittam Smith , [[Stephen Glover  columnist |Stephen Glover  and Matthew Symonds. All three partners were former journalists at ''[[The Daily Telegraph '' who had left the paper towards the end of [[Michael Berry, Baron Hartwell|Lord Hartwell 's ownership. [[Marcus Sieff  was the first chairman of Newspaper Publishing, and Whittam Smith took control of the paper.  The paper was created at a time of a fundamental change in British newspaper publishing. [[Rupert Murdoch  was challenging long-accepted practices of the print unions and ultimately defeated them in the [[Wapping dispute . Consequently, production costs could be reduced which, it was said at the time, created openings for more competition. As a result of controversy around Murdoch's move to Wapping, the plant was effectively having to function under siege from sacked print workers picketing outside. ''The Independent'' attracted some of the staff from the two Murdoch broadsheets who had chosen not to move to his company's new headquarters. Launched with the advertising slogan ""It is. Are you?"", and challenging both ''[[The Guardian '' for centre-left readers and ''[[The Times '' as the newspaper of record, ''The Independent'' reached a circulation of over 400,000 by 1989.  Competing in a moribund market, ''The Independent'' sparked a general freshening of newspaper design as well as, within a few years, a price war in the market sector. When ''The Independent'' launched ''The Independent on Sunday'' in 1990, sales were less than anticipated, partly due to the launch of the ''[[Sunday Correspondent '' four months prior, although this direct rival closed at the end of November 1990. Some aspects of production merged with the main paper, although the Sunday paper retained a largely distinct editorial staff.  ===1990–1999 === In the 1990s, ''The Independent'' was faced with price cutting by the Murdoch titles, and started an advertising campaign accusing ''The Times'' and ''The Daily Telegraph'' of reflecting the views of their proprietors, Rupert Murdoch and [[Conrad Black . It featured spoofs of the other papers' [[Masthead  publishing |mastheads  with the words ''The Rupert Murdoch'' or ''The Conrad Black'', with ''The Independent'' below the main title.   had financial problems. A number of other media companies were interested in the paper. [[Tony O'Reilly 's media group and [[Trinity Mirror|Mirror Group Newspapers   MGN  had bought a stake of about a third each by mid-1994. In March 1995, Newspaper Publishing was restructured with a rights issue, splitting the shareholding into O'Reilly's [[Independent News & Media   43% , [[Trinity Mirror|MGN   43% , and [[PRISA|Prisa   publisher of ''[[El País ''   12% .  In April 1996, there was another refinancing, and in March 1998, O'Reilly bought the other shares of the company for £30&nbsp;million, and assumed the company's debt. Brendan Hopkins headed Independent News, [[Andrew Marr  was appointed editor of ''The Independent'', and [[Rosie Boycott  became editor of ''The Independent on Sunday''. Marr introduced a dramatic if short-lived redesign which won critical favour but was a commercial failure, partly as a result of a limited promotional budget. Marr admitted his changes had been a mistake in his book, ''My Trade''.  Boycott left in April 1998 to join the ''[[Daily Express '', and Marr left in May 1998, later becoming the [[BBC 's political editor. [[Simon Kelner  was appointed as the editor. By this time the circulation had fallen below 200,000. Independent News spent heavily to increase circulation, and the paper went through several redesigns. While circulation increased, it did not approach the level which had been achieved in 1989, or restore profitability. Job cuts and financial controls reduced the morale of journalists and the quality of the product.<ref name=""Mad eyes""></ref>  ===2000–2009 === Ivan Fallon, on the board since 1995 and formerly a key figure at ''The Sunday Times'', replaced Hopkins as head of Independent News & Media in July 2002. By mid-2004, the newspaper was losing £5&nbsp;million per year. A gradual improvement meant that by 2006, circulation was at a nine-year high.<ref name=""Mad eyes"" />  In November 2008, following further staff cuts, production was moved to Northcliffe House, in Kensington High Street, the headquarters of [[Associated Newspapers Ltd|Associated Newspapers .<ref name=""Northcliffe move""></ref> The two newspaper groups' editorial, management and commercial operations remained separate, but they shared services including security, information technology, switchboard and payroll.  ===2010–2016 === On 25 March 2010, Independent News & Media sold the newspaper to [[Russian oligarchs|Russian oligarch  [[Alexander Lebedev  for a nominal £1 fee and £9.25m over the next 10 months, choosing this option over closing ''The Independent'' and ''The Independent on Sunday'', which would have cost £28m and £40m respectively, due to long-term contracts.<ref name=""i2010-03-25"" /><ref name=bintliff></ref> In 2009, Lebedev had bought a controlling stake in the ''[[London Evening Standard ''. Two weeks later, editor [[Roger Alton  resigned.  In July 2011, ''The Independent''s columnist [[Johann Hari  was stripped of the [[Orwell Prize  he had won in 2008 after claims, to which Hari later admitted, of plagiarism and inaccuracy. In January 2012, [[Chris Blackhurst , editor of ''The Independent'', told the [[Leveson inquiry  that the scandal had ""severely damaged"" the newspaper's reputation. He nevertheless told the inquiry that Hari would return as a columnist in ""four to five weeks"". Hari later announced that he would not return to ''The Independent''. [[Jonathan Foreman  journalist |Jonathan Foreman  contrasted ''The Independent''s reaction to the scandal unfavourably with the reaction of American newspapers to similar incidents such as the [[Jayson Blair  case, which led to resignations of editors, ""deep soul-searching"", and ""new standards of exactitude being imposed"". The historian [[Guy Walters  suggested that Hari's fabrications had been an open secret amongst the newspaper's staff and that their internal inquiry was a ""facesaving exercise"". A proportion of articles are now behind a pay wall, that section is titled, 'Independent Minds'.  ''The Independent'' and ''The Independent on Sunday'' endorsed the ""Remain"" in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|Brexit referendum of 2016 .  === From 2016 === In March 2016 ''The Independent'' decided to close its print edition and become an [[Online newspaper|online newspaper ; the last printed edition was published on Saturday 26 March 2016. ''The Independent on Sunday'' published its last print edition on 20 March 2016 and was closed following that.   ==Content==  ===Format and design=== <!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Independent front page.jpg|thumb|right|''The Independent''s front page,<br />15 February 2014  --> ''The Independent'' began publishing as a broadsheet, in a series of celebrated designs. The final version was designed by Carroll, Dempsey and Thirkell following a commission by [[Nicholas Garland  who, along with [[Alexander Chancellor , was unhappy with designs produced by Raymond Hawkey and Michael McGuiness – on seeing the proposed designs, Chancellor had said ""I thought we were joining a serious paper"". The first edition was designed and implemented by Michael Crozier, who was Executive Editor, Design and Picture, from pre-launch in 1986 to 1994.  From September 2003, the paper was produced in both broadsheet and tabloid-sized versions, with the same content in each. The tabloid edition was termed ""compact"" to distance itself from the more sensationalist reporting style usually associated with ""tabloid"" newspapers in the UK.<ref name=""Bus Week""></ref> After launching in the London area and then in [[North West England ,<ref name=""Indy northwest""></ref> the smaller format appeared gradually throughout the UK. Soon afterwards, Rupert Murdoch's ''Times'' followed suit, introducing its own tabloid-sized version.<ref name=""Brand Rep""></ref> Prior to these changes, ''The Independent'' had a daily circulation of around 217,500, the lowest of any major national British daily, a figure that climbed by 15% as of March 2004  to 250,000 . Throughout much of 2006, circulation stagnated at a quarter of a million. On 14 May 2004, ''The Independent'' produced its last weekday broadsheet, having stopped producing a Saturday broadsheet edition in January. ''The Independent on Sunday'' published its last simultaneous broadsheet on 9 October 2005, and has since followed a compact design.  On 12 April 2005, ''The Independent'' redesigned its layout to a more European feel, similar to France's ''[[Libération ''. The redesign was carried out by a Barcelona-based design studio. The weekday second section was subsumed within the main paper, double-page feature articles became common in the main news sections, and there were revisions to the front and back covers.<ref name=""Guard redesign""></ref> A new second section, ""Extra"", was introduced on 25 April 2006. It is similar to ''The Guardian''s ""G2"" and ''The Times''s ""Times2"", containing features, reportage and games, including [[sudoku . In June 2007, ''The Independent on Sunday'' consolidated its content into a news section which included sports and business, and a magazine focusing on life and culture. On 23 September 2008, the main newspaper became full-colour, and ""Extra"" was replaced by an ""Independent Life Supplement"" focusing on different themes each day.  Three weeks after the acquisition of the paper by [[Alexander Lebedev  and [[Evgeny Lebedev  in 2010, the paper was relaunched with another redesign on 20 April. The new format featured smaller headlines and a new pullout ""Viewspaper"" section, which contained the paper's comment and feature articles.<ref name=""pgazette""></ref> From 26 October 2010, the same day as its sister paper, ''i'', was launched, ''The Independent'' was printed on slightly thicker paper than before and ceased to be full-colour throughout, with many photographs and pictures  though none of those used in adverts  being printed in black and white only. On 11 October 2011, ''The Independent'' unveiled yet another new look, featuring a red, sans-serif masthead. In November 2013, the whole newspaper was overhauled again, including new custom fonts and a vertical masthead in black.  ===Front pages=== Following the 2003 switch in format, ''The Independent'' became known for its unorthodox and campaigning front pages, which frequently relied on images, graphics or lists rather than traditional headlines and written news content. For example, following the Kashmir earthquake in 2005, it used its front page to urge its readers to donate to its appeal fund, and following the publication of the [[Hutton Inquiry|Hutton Report  into the death of British government scientist [[David Kelly  weapons expert |David Kelly , its front page simply carried the word ""Whitewash?""<ref name=""PR week""></ref> In 2003, the paper's editor, Simon Kelner, was named ""Editor of the Year"" at the ''[[What the Papers Say '' awards, partly in recognition of, according to the judges, his ""often arresting and imaginative front-page designs"".<ref name=""Indy award""></ref> In 2008, however, as he was stepping down as editor, he stated that it was possible to ""overdo the formula"" and that the style of the paper's front pages perhaps needed ""reinvention"".<ref name=""Guard Kelner""></ref>  Under the subsequent editorship of [[Chris Blackhurst , the campaigning, poster-style front pages were scaled back in favour of more conventional news stories.  ===Sections=== The weekday, Saturday and Sunday editions of ''The Independent'' all included supplements and pull-out subsections:  {| |- valign=top |width=50%| Daily  Monday to Friday  ''The Independent'': *""Monday Sport"": A weekly pull-out containing reports of the previous weekend's sporting events. Saturday's ''The Independent'': *""Saturday Sport"": A weekly pull-out containing reports looking ahead to the weekend's sporting events. *""Radar"": A compact, primarily [[listings magazine , including television schedules, film and DVD reviews and events listings for the coming week. It also includes a round-up of the ""50 best"" items in a particular category. For example, over the Christmas period there are weekly supplements of ""Gifts for him"" and ""Gifts for her"". *""Traveller"": Contains travel articles and advertisements. *""The Independent Magazine"": A features magazine including sections on food, interiors and fashion. |width=50%| ''The Independent on Sunday'': *""Sport"": A weekly pull-out containing reports of Saturday's sporting events. *""The New Review"": A features magazine. *""Arts & Books"": A culture supplement. *""[[Rainbow List "" An annually-updated list, first published in 2000, then as the ""Pink List"", of the most famous and influential people who have declared themselves lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.<ref name=""Rainbow-why""></ref> |}  ===Online presence=== On 23 January 2008, ''The Independent'' relaunched its online edition, www.independent.co.uk. The relaunched site introduced a new look, better access to the blog service, priority on image and video content, and additional areas of the site including art, architecture, fashion, gadgets and health. The paper launched [[podcast  programmes such as ""The Independent Music Radio Show"", ""The Independent Travel Guides"", ""The Independent Sailing Podcasts"", and ""The Independent Video Travel Guides"". Since 2009, the website has carried short video news bulletins provided by the [[Al Jazeera English  news channel.<ref name=""Guard al Jazeera""></ref>  In 2014, ''The Independent'' launched a sister website, ''i100'', a ""shareable"" journalism site with similarities to [[Reddit  and [[Upworthy .  ==Political views== When the paper was established in 1986, the founders intended its political stance to reflect the centre of the British political spectrum and thought that it would attract readers primarily from ''The Times'' and ''The Daily Telegraph''. It has been seen as leaning to the left wing of the political spectrum, making it more a competitor to ''[[The Guardian '', although both also feature conservative columnists. ''The Independent'' tends to take a [[classical liberal , pro-market stance on economic issues.<ref name=""Wilby""/> In an editorial on 27 January 2013, the ''Independent on Sunday'' referred to itself as a ""proudly liberal newspaper"".  The paper took a strong editorial position against the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq , the [[Iraq War , and aspects of US and UK foreign policy related to the [[War on Terrorism  following the . It has been a strong supporter of [[electoral reform .<ref name=lead2010may5/> The paper has also taken strong positions on environmental issues, campaigned against the introduction of [[British national identity card|ID cards , and campaigned against the restriction of mass immigration to the UK.  In 1997, ''The Independent on Sunday'' launched a campaign for the decriminalisation of cannabis. Ten years later, it reversed itself, claiming that the cannabis strain ""skunk"" ""smoked by the majority of young Britons"" in 2007 had become ""25 times stronger than [[hashish|resin  sold a decade ago"".<ref name=""Indy cannabis""></ref>  In addition, ''The Independent'' has highlighted what it refers to as ""war crimes"" being committed by pro-government forces in the [[War in Darfur|Darfur  region of Sudan.<ref name=""Indy Darfur""></ref>  Originally, it avoided royal stories, Whittam Smith later saying he thought the British press was ""unduly besotted"" with the Royal Family and that a newspaper could ""manage without"" stories about the monarchy.<ref name=""Whittam Smith Royals""></ref>  In 2007, [[Alan Rusbridger , editor of ''The Guardian'', said of ''The Independent'': ""The emphasis on views, not news, means that the reporting is rather thin, and it loses impact on the front page the more you do that"". In a 12 June 2007 speech, British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair  called ''The Independent'' a ""viewspaper"", saying it ""was started as an antidote to the idea of journalism as views not news. That was why it was called the Independent. Today it is avowedly a viewspaper not merely a newspaper"". ''The Independent'' criticised Blair's comments the following day but later changed format to include a ""Viewspaper"" insert in the centre of the regular newspaper, designed to feature most of the opinion columns and arts reviews.  A leader published on the day of the [[London mayoral election, 2008|2008 London Mayoral election  compared the candidates and said that, if the newspaper had a vote, it would vote first for the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party  candidate, [[Sian Berry , noting the similarity between her priorities and those of ''The Independent'', and secondly, with ""rather heavy heart"", for the incumbent, [[Ken Livingstone .<ref name=""London endorsement""></ref>  An [[Ipsos MORI  poll estimated that in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election , 44% of regular readers voted Liberal Democrat, 32% voted Labour, and 14% voted Conservative, compared to 23%, 29%, and 36%, respectively, of the overall electorate. On the eve of the 2010 general election, ''The Independent'' supported the Liberal Democrats, arguing that ""they are longstanding and convincing champions of civil liberties, sound economics, international co-operation on the great global challenges and, of course, fundamental electoral reform. These are all principles that this newspaper has long held dear. That is why we argue that there is a strong case for progressively minded voters to lend their support to the Liberal Democrats wherever there is a clear opportunity for that party to win"".<ref name=lead2010may5></ref> However, the weekend before the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election  saw ''The Independent on Sunday'' claim it would not be advising its readers how to vote in 2015. The editorial piece claimed that ""this does not mean that we are a bloodless, value-free news-sheet. We have always been committed to social justice"", but the paper recognised that it was up the readers to ""make up your own mind about whether you agree with us or not"".

Many famous scientists, including [[Albert Einstein , have contributed articles to it. It is the oldest continuously published monthly magazine in the United States  though it only became monthly in 1921 .  ==History== ''Scientific American'' was founded by inventor and publisher [[Rufus Porter  inventor |Rufus M. Porter  in 1845<ref name=""scientificamerican1""></ref> as a four-page weekly newspaper. Throughout its early years, much emphasis was placed on reports of what was going on at the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office . It also reported on a broad range of inventions including [[perpetual motion  machines, an 1860 device for buoying vessels by [[Abraham Lincoln , and the [[universal joint  which now can be found in nearly every [[automobile  manufactured. Current issues include a ""this date in history"" section, featuring excerpts from articles originally published 50, 100, and 150 years earlier. Topics include humorous incidents, wrong-headed theories, and noteworthy advances in the history of science and technology.  Porter sold the publication to [[Alfred Ely Beach  and [[Orson Desaix Munn  a mere ten months after founding it. Until 1948, it remained owned by Munn & Company.<ref name=""scientificamerican1""/> Under Munn's grandson, Orson Desaix Munn III, it had evolved into something of a ""workbench"" publication, similar to the twentieth-century incarnation of ''[[Popular Science  magazine |Popular Science ''.  In the years after World War II, the magazine fell into decline. In 1948, three partners who were planning on starting a new popular science magazine, to be called ''The Sciences'', purchased the assets of the old ''Scientific American'' instead and put its name on the designs they had created for their new magazine. Thus the partnerspublisher [[Gerard Piel , editor [[Dennis Flanagan , and general manager Donald H. Miller, Jr.essentially created a new magazine. Miller retired in 1979, Flanagan and Piel in 1984, when Gerard Piel's son Jonathan became president and editor; circulation had grown fifteen-fold since 1948. In 1986, it was sold to the [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group|Holtzbrinck  group of Germany, which has owned it since.  In the fall of 2008, ''Scientific American'' was put under the control of [[Nature Publishing Group , a division of Holtzbrinck.<ref name=""FOLIO""></ref>  Donald Miller died in December 1998, Gerard Piel in September 2004 and Dennis Flanagan in January 2005. [[Mariette DiChristina  is the current editor-in-chief, after [[John Rennie  editor |John Rennie  stepped down in June 2009.<ref name=""FOLIO""/>  ==International editions==  ''Scientific American'' published its first foreign edition in 1890, the Spanish-language ''La America Cientifica''. Publication was suspended in 1905, and another 63 years would pass before another foreign-language edition appeared: In 1968, an Italian edition, ''[[Le Scienze '', was launched, and a Japanese edition, '''', followed three years later. A new Spanish edition, ''Investigación y Ciencia'' was launched in Spain in 1976, followed by a French edition, '''', in France in 1977, and a German edition, '''', in Germany in 1978. A Russian edition ''V Mire Nauki'' was launched in the Soviet Union in 1983, and continues in the present-day Russian [[Federation . ''Kexue''  科学, ""Science"" in Chinese , a simplified Chinese edition launched in 1979, was the first Western magazine published in the [[People's Republic of China . Founded in [[Chongqing , the simplified Chinese magazine was transferred to [[Beijing  in 2001. Later in 2005, a newer edition, ''Global Science''  环球科学 , was published instead of ''Kexue'', which shut down due to financial problems. A traditional Chinese edition, known as '''', was introduced to [[Taiwan  in 2002. The Hungarian edition ''Tudomány'' existed between 1984 and 1992. In 1986, an Arabic edition, '''', was published<!--where?-->. In 2002, a Portuguese edition was launched in Brazil.  Today, ''Scientific American'' publishes 18 foreign-language editions around the globe: Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, [[Simplified Chinese , [[Traditional Chinese , Czech, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian  discontinued after 15 issues , Polish, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish.  From 1902 to 1911, ''Scientific American'' supervised the publication of the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana '', which during some of that period was known as ''The Americana''.  ==First issue==  [[File:Scientific American - Series 1 - Volume 001 - Issue 01.pdf|thumb|PDF of first issue: ''Scientific American'' Vol. 1, No. 01 published August 28, 1845 [[File:SciAmer.gif|thumb|200px|Cover of the September 1848 issue   It originally styled itself ""The Advocate of Industry and Enterprise"" and ""Journal of Mechanical and other Improvements"".

The magazine's 50 awards cover many categories including agriculture, communications, defence, environment, and medical diagnostics. The complete list of each year's winners appear in the December issue of the magazine, as well as on the magazine's web site.  ==Website== In March 1996, ''Scientific American'' launched its own website that includes articles from current and past issues, online-only features, daily news, weird science, special reports, trivia, ""Scidoku"" and more.  ==Columns== Notable features have included: * [[Martin Gardner 's [[List of Martin Gardner Mathematical Games columns|Mathematical Games column  * [[Douglas Hofstadter 's [[Metamagical Themas  * [[The Amateur Scientist  column * [[Alexander Dewdney|A.K. Dewdney 's Computer Recreations column * [[Michael Shermer 's Skeptic column  ==Television== From 1990 to 2005 ''Scientific American'' produced a television program on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS  called ''[[Scientific American Frontiers '' with hosts [[Woodie Flowers  and [[Alan Alda .  ==Books== From 1983 to 1997, ''Scientific American'' has produced an encyclopedia set of volumes from their publishing division, the '''Scientific American Library'''.  These books were not sold in retail stores, but as a [[Book of the Month Club  selection priced from $24.95 to $32.95. Topics covered dozens of areas of scientific knowledge and included in-depth essays on: The Animal Mind; Atmosphere, Climate, and Change; Beyond the Third Dimension; Cosmic Clouds; Cycles of Life • Civilization and the Biosphere; The Discovery Of Subatomic Particles; Diversity and the Tropical Rain Forest; Earthquakes and Geological Discovery; Exploring Planetary Worlds; Gravity's Fatal Attraction; Fire; Fossils And The History Of Life; From Quarks to the Cosmos; A Guided Tour Of The Living Cell; Human Diversity; Perception; The Solar System; Sun and Earth; The Science of Words  Linguistics ; The Science Of Musical Sound; The Second Law  of Thermodynamics ; Stars; Supercomputing and the Transformation of Science.

Contributors include [[Seth Shostak , [[Paul Offit , [[Richard Dawkins  and [[Harriet A. Hall|Harriet Hall .<ref name=""SI 2018""></ref>  ==Scientific and political debate== In April 1950, the U.S. [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission  ordered ''Scientific American'' to cease publication of an issue containing an article by [[Hans Bethe  that appeared to reveal classified information about the thermonuclear [[hydrogen bomb . Subsequent review of the material determined that the AEC had overreacted. The incident was important for the ""new"" ''Scientific American'''s history, as the AEC's decision to burn 3000 copies of an early press-run of the magazine containing the offending material appeared to be ""[[book burning  in a free society"" when publisher Gerard Piel leaked the incident to the press.  In its January 2002 issue, ''Scientific American'' published a series of criticisms of the [[Bjørn Lomborg  book ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist ''. [[Cato Institute  fellow [[Patrick J. Michaels  said the attacks came because the book ""threatens billions of taxpayer dollars that go into the global change kitty every year."" Journalist [[Ronald Bailey  called the criticism ""disturbing"" and ""dishonest"", writing, ""The subhead of the review section, 'Science defends itself against ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'',' gives the show away: Religious and political views need to defend themselves against criticism, but science is supposed to be a process for determining the facts.""  The May 2007 issue featured a column by [[Michael Shermer  calling for a United States pullout from the [[Iraq War . In response, ''[[Wall Street Journal '' online columnist [[James Taranto  jokingly called ''Scientific American'' ""a liberal political magazine"".  The publisher was criticized in 2009 when it notified collegiate libraries that yearly subscription prices for the magazine would increase by nearly 500% for print and 50% for online access to $1500 yearly.  An editorial in the September 2016 issue of Scientific American attacked U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump for alleged ""anti-science"" attitudes and rhetoric. This marked the first time that the publication forayed into commenting on U.S. presidential politics.  ==Awards== * 2010: [[IQ Award  for the German edition ''Spektrum der Wissenschaft''  ==Top 10 Science Stories of the Year==  *'''2011:''' The Japan Tsunami and Nuclear Crisis **Technology Fuels the Arab Spring **Faster-Than-Light Neutrinos? **Record-Setting Extreme Weather **A Hint of Higgs **The End of the Space Shuttle Program **The Death of Steve Jobs **Gene Therapy Makes a Comeback **The Sun Sets on Solyndra **IBM's Watson Computer Wins on Jeopardy! *'''2012:''' Sandy Devastates the U.S. Northeastern Coast **The Higgs Boson Is Detected **NASA's Curiosity Rover Lands on Mars **Publication of the ENCODE Encyclopedia: A Milestone in Genome Research **""Obamacare""  Mostly  Upheld by Supreme Court **Record Meltdown of Arctic Sea Ice **Pandemic Avian Flu Genes Made Public **Bold, Private Efforts Step into Roles Vacated by NASA **Starvation Diet Fails to Boost Longevity **Daredevils Reach New Highs and Lows *'''2013:''' U.S. Sequestration: A Body Blow to Science **Atmospheric CO2 Reaches a Historical High: 400 Parts per Million **Meteor Explodes over Chelyabinsk, Russia **Typhoon Haiyan, the Strongest Storm Known to Make Landfall **Recovery of Oldest Human DNA **The First Neutrinos from Outside the Solar System **Confirmed: Fracking and Related Operations Cause Earthquakes **Gene Therapy Achieves Major Success **Drones Fly Toward Wide Commercial Use, Raising New Concerns **Moon Shot to the Head: Global Initiatives Target the Brain *'''2014:''' The Ebola Outbreak **First Touchdown on a Comet **U.S. and China in Historic Climate Deal **Big Bang Gravitational Waves—or Not **Worst Drought in Millennium Hits California **Catastrophes Tarnish Commercial Spaceflight **Botched Handling of Deadly Germs at U.S. Labs **First Synthetic Chromosome of Yeast Made **Cyber Attacks Spell the End of Magnetic-Stripe Credit Cards **Symbolic Thought Shown to Exist in Other Human Species *'''2015:''' Year of the Dwarf Planets and New Views of Mars **The CRISPR Revolution Gains Momentum **Massive Data Breach Highlights Widespread Cybersecurity **Record Climate Change **Newly Discovered Human Raises Questions about our Past **Advances in Concussion Science **Volkswagen Sabotages ""Clean"" Diesel **A Century of General Relativity **Drones Fly onto Regulators' Radar **New Discoveries about The Immune System Impacts the Brain '' Tie ''  **The Uncharted Territory of Ebola '' Tie ''  ==Controversy== In 2013, [[Danielle N. Lee , a female scientist who blogged at ''Scientific American'', was called a ""whore"" in an email by an editor at the science website ''Biology Online'' after refusing to write professional content without compensation. When Lee, outraged about the email, wrote a rebuttal on her ''Scientific American'' blog, the editor-in-chief of ''Scientific American'', [[Mariette DiChristina , removed the post, sparking an outrage by supporters of Lee. While DiChristina cited legal reasons for removing the blog, others criticized her for censoring Lee. The editor at Biology Online was fired after the incident.  The controversy widened in the ensuing days. The magazine's blog editor, Bora Zivkovic, was the subject of allegations of sexual harassment by another blogger, Monica Byrne.<ref name=creep></ref> Although the alleged incident had occurred about a year earlier, editor Mariette DiChristina informed readers that the incident had been investigated and resolved to Ms. Byrne's satisfaction. However, the incident involving Dr. Lee had prompted Ms. Byrne to reveal the identity of Zivkovic, following the latter's support of Dr. Lee. Zivkovic responded on Twitter and his own blog, admitting the incident with Ms. Byrne had taken place.<ref name=Zivkovic></ref> His blog post apologized to Ms. Byrne, and referred to the incident as ""singular"", stating that his behavior was not ""engaged in before or since.""<ref name=Zivkovic />  Due to the allegations, Zivkovic resigned from the board of [[Science Online , the popular science blogging conference that he helped establish. Following Zivkovic's admission, several prominent female bloggers, including other bloggers for the magazine, wrote their own accounts that contradicted Zivkovic's assertions, alleging additional incidents of sexual harassment.<ref name=creep /> A day after these new revelations, Zivkovic resigned his position at ''Scientific American'', according to a press release from the magazine.  ==See also== * [[Albert Graham Ingalls , former editor and author of an [[amateur astronomy  column * [[Amos Root  * ''[[New Scientist '' * ''[[Scientific American Mind '' * [[Discover  magazine |''Discover''  magazine   * ''[[American Scientist '' * [[14145 Sciam , asteroid named after ''Scientific American''  ==References== ===Specific===    ===General===  *   ==External links==  * [https://www.scientificamerican.com/ Online edition] of ''Scientific American'' with partially free access to the current issue * [http://www.sciamdigital.com/ Online archive]  not free  of the issues from 1993 to the present * [http://www.scientificamericanpast.com/ Online archive] of the issues before 1930, with [http://www.scientificamericanpast.com/indexfiles.htm indices] * [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa/moa_browse.html Online archive] of ''Scientific American'' between 1846 and 1869, from [[Cornell University  * [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Scientific_American_-_Series_1 Online archive] of Series 1 of ''Scientific American'' between 1845 and 1859  Volumes 1 - 14  * [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Scientific_American_-_Series_2 Online archive] of Series 2 of ''Scientific American'' between 1859 and 1861  Volumes 1 - 4  * [http://www.magazineart.org/main.php/v/technical/scientificamerican/ Online archive] of the covers of more than a thousand issues from circa 1872 to 1931 *  *      [[Category:Scientific American|   [[Category:1845 establishments in the United States  [[Category:American monthly magazines  [[Category:Magazines published in New York City  [[Category:Magazines established in 1845  [[Category:American science and technology magazines  [[Category:Popular science magazines ","Scientific American  informally abbreviated SciAm or sometimes SA  is an American popular science magazine.

[[Madan Mohan Malaviya  and [[Tara Singh  activist |Tara Singh  were among the members of the Managing Committee. The Managing Chairman and Chief Patron was Master Sunder Singh Lyallpuri.  [[K. M. Panikkar  was the person of behaviour ; [[Devdas Gandhi   son of [[Mahatma Gandhi   on the editor's panel, and later editor.

It contained writings and articles from [[C. F. Andrews  and [[Cattamanchi Ramalinga Reddy , among others.  [[K. M. Panikkar  also known as Sardar Panikkar launched the ''Hindustan Times'' as a serious nationalist newspaper. As an Oxonian, historian, and litterateur, Panikkar must have hoped to make his paper eventually more than an Akali sheet. He became the editor and funds flowed freely from activist Akali patrons. He exerted himself strenuously, but the paper made very little headway. In two years Panikkar could not take the print order any higher than 3,000. By then the Akali movement appeared to lose steam and funds dried up. The paper was saved from an untimely demise when [[Madan Mohan Malaviya|'''Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya'''  stepped in to realise his vision of a newspaper in Delhi.  Malaviya raised 50,000 rupees to acquire the ''Hindustan Times'' along with the help of nationalist leaders Lajpat Rai and M. R. Jayakar and industrialist G. D. Birla, who paid most of the cash. Birla took full control of the paper in 1933. The paper continues to be owned by the Birla family.  It has its roots in the [[Indian independence movement  of the first half of the twentieth century and even faced the noted ""''Hindustan Times'' Contempt Case  August–November, 1941 "" at [[Allahabad High Court . It was edited at times by many important people in India, including [[Devdas Gandhi , Sri Mulgaonkar, B.G.Verghese and [[Khushwant Singh .

It is owned by parent company [[Reach plc . From 1985 to 1987, and from 1997 to 2002, the title on its [[masthead  publishing |masthead  was simply ''The Mirror''. It had an average daily print circulation of 716,923 in December 2016, dropping markedly to 587,803 the following year.<ref name='circ'></ref> Its Sunday sister paper is the ''[[Sunday Mirror ''.  Unlike other major British tabloids such as ''[[The Sun  United Kingdom |The Sun '' and the ''[[Daily Mail '', the ''Mirror'' has no separate Scottish edition; this function is performed by the ''[[Daily Record  Scotland |Daily Record '' and ''[[Sunday Mail  Scotland |Sunday Mail '', which incorporate certain stories from the ''Mirror'' that are of Scottish significance.  Originally pitched to the middle-class reader, it was converted into a working-class newspaper after 1934, in order to reach a larger audience. The ''Mirror'' has had a number of owners. It was founded by [[Alfred Harmsworth , who sold it to his brother [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Harold Harmsworth   from 1914 Lord Rothermere  in 1913. In 1963 a restructuring of the media interests of the Harmsworth family led to the ''Mirror'' becoming a part of [[IPC Media#International Publishing Corporation|International Publishing Corporation . During the mid 1960s, daily sales exceeded 5 million copies, a feat never repeated by it or any other daily  non-Sunday  British newspaper since. The ''Mirror'' was owned by [[Robert Maxwell  between 1984 and 1991. The paper went through a protracted period of crisis after his death before merging with the regional newspaper group Trinity in 1999 to form [[Trinity Mirror .  During the 1930s the paper was editorially sympathetic to [[Oswald Mosley  and the [[British Union of Fascists . The paper has consistently supported the [[Labour Party  UK |Labour Party  since the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election .  ==History== ===1903–95=== [[File:Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe - Project Gutenberg eText 15305.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Alfred Harmsworth   later Lord Northcliffe , founder of the ''Daily Mirror''  ''The Daily Mirror'' was launched on 2 November 1903 by [[Alfred Harmsworth   later Lord Northcliffe  as a newspaper for women, run by women. Hence the name: he said, ""I intend it to be really a mirror of feminine life as well on its grave as on its lighter sides&nbsp;... to be entertaining without being frivolous, and serious without being dull"". It cost one [[Penny  British pre-decimal coin |penny   equivalent to p in  .  It was not an immediate success and in 1904 Harmsworth decided to turn it into a pictorial newspaper with a broader focus. Harmsworth appointed [[Hamilton Fyfe  as editor and all of the paper's female journalists were fired. The masthead was changed to ''The Daily Illustrated Mirror'', which ran from 26 January to 27 April 1904  issues 72 to 150 , when it reverted to ''The Daily Mirror''.<ref name=Albion>[[Albion  history journal |Albion   1973  Vol 5, 2-page 150</ref> The first issue of the relaunched paper did not have advertisements on the front page as previously, but instead news text and engraved pictures  of a traitor and an actress , with the promise of photographs inside. Two days later, the price was dropped to one [[Halfpenny  British pre-decimal coin |halfpenny  and to the masthead was added: ""A paper for men and women"". This combination was more successful: by issue 92, the guaranteed circulation was 120,000 copies and by issue 269, it had grown to 200,000: by then the name had reverted and the front page was mainly photographs. Circulation grew to 466,000 making it the second-largest morning newspaper.  Alfred Harmsworth sold the newspaper to his brother [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Harold Harmsworth   from 1914 Lord Rothermere  in 1913. In 1917, the price was increased to one penny.<ref name=DM4163>''Daily Mirror'' issue 4163, 26 February 1917</ref> Circulation continued to grow: in 1919, some issues sold more than a million copies a day, making it the largest daily picture paper.<ref name=DM4856>''Daily Mirror'' issue 4856, 19 May 1919</ref> In 1924 the newspaper sponsored the  [[1924 Women's Olympiad  held at [[Stamford Bridge  stadium |Stamford Bridge  in London.  [[File:Lord Rothermere.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere   Lord Rothermere was a friend of [[Benito Mussolini  and [[Adolf Hitler , and directed the ''Mirror''s editorial stance towards them in the early 1930s.<ref name=""Griffiths1980""></ref> On Monday, 22 January, 1934 the Daily Mirror ran the headline ""Give the Blackshirts a helping hand"" urging readers to join Sir Mosley's British Union of Fascists, and giving the address to which to send membership applications. By the mid-1930s, the ''Mirror'' was struggling – it and the ''Mail'' were the main casualties of the early 1930s circulation war that saw the ''[[Daily Herald  UK newspaper |Daily Herald '' and the ''[[Daily Express '' establish circulations of more than two million, and Rothermere decided to sell his shares in it.  In 1935 Rothermere sold the paper to H. G. Bartholomew and [[Hugh Cudlipp .  With [[Cecil Harmsworth King|Cecil King   Rothermere's nephew  in charge of the paper's finances and Guy Bartholomew as editor, during the late 1930s the ''Mirror'' was transformed from a conservative, middle class newspaper into a [[left-wing politics|left-wing  paper for the working class. Partly on the advice of the American advertising agency J. Walter Thompson, the ''Mirror'' became the first British paper to adopt the appearance of the New York tabloids. The headlines became bigger, the stories shorter and the illustrations more abundant. By 1939, the publication was selling 1.4&nbsp;million copies a day. In 1937, [[Hugh McClelland  cartoonist |Hugh McClelland  introduced his wild Western comic strip ''Beelzebub Jones'' in the ''Daily Mirror''. After taking over as cartoon chief at the ''Mirror'' in 1945, he dropped ''Beelzebub Jones'' and moved on to a variety of new strips.  During the Second World War the ''Mirror'' positioned itself as the paper of the ordinary soldier and civilian, and was critical of the political leadership and the established parties. At one stage, the paper was threatened with closure following the publication of a [[Philip Zec  [[political cartoon|cartoon   captioned by [[William Connor  , which was misinterpreted by [[Winston Churchill  and [[Herbert Morrison .<ref name=cassandra></ref> In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election  the paper strongly supported the [[Labour Party  UK |Labour Party  in its eventual landslide victory. In doing so, the paper supported Herbert Morrison, who co-ordinated Labour's campaign, and recruited his former antagonist Philip Zec to reproduce, on the front page, a popular [[VE Day  cartoon on the morning of the election, suggesting that Labour were the only party who could maintain peace in post-war Britain.<ref name=""tabloidnation""/> By the late 1940s, it was selling 4.5&nbsp;million copies a day, outstripping the ''Express''; for some 30 years afterwards, it dominated the British daily newspaper market, selling more than 5 million copies a day at its peak in the mid-1960s.  The ''Mirror'' was an influential model for German tabloid ''[[Bild '', which was founded in 1952 and became Europe's biggest-selling newspaper.  [[File:Daily Mirror 20130413 052.jpg|thumb|Daily Mirror Building  1957-1960  in Langham Place, London   In 1955, the ''Mirror'' and its stablemate the ''Sunday Pictorial''  later to become the ''Sunday Mirror''  began printing a northern edition in [[Manchester . In 1957 it introduced the Andy Capp cartoon, created by Reg Smythe from Hartlepool, in the northern editions.  The ''Mirror'' mass working class readership had made it the United Kingdom's best-selling daily tabloid newspaper. In 1960, it acquired the ''[[Daily Herald  UK newspaper |Daily Herald ''  the popular daily of the labour movement  when it bought [[Odhams , in one of a series of takeovers which created the [[IPC Media|International Publishing Corporation   IPC . The ''Mirror'' management did not want the ''Herald'' competing with the ''Mirror'' for readers, and in 1964, relaunched it as a mid-market paper, now named ''[[The Sun  United Kingdom |The Sun ''. When it failed to win readers, the ''Sun'' was sold to [[Rupert Murdoch  – who immediately relaunched it as a more [[populism|populist  and sensationalist tabloid and a direct competitor to the ''Mirror''.  <!-- I didn't put this in the ""Famous Features"", as Mirrorscope was short-lived, and not famous! --> In an attempt to cater to a different kind of reader, the ''Mirror'' launched the ""Mirrorscope"" pull-out section on 30 January 1968. The ''[[Press Gazette '' commented: ""The ''Daily Mirror'' launched its revolutionary four-page supplement ""Mirrorscope"". The ambitious brief for the supplement, which ran on Wednesdays and Fridays, was to deal with international affairs, politics, industry, science, the arts and business"". The ''British Journalism Review'' said in 2002 that ""Mirrorscope"" was ""a game attempt to provide serious analysis in the rough and tumble of the tabloids"". It failed to attract significant numbers of new readers, and the pull-out section was abandoned, its final issue appearing on 27 August 1974.  In 1978, ''The Sun'' overtook the ''Mirror'' in circulation, and in 1984 the ''Mirror'' was sold to [[Robert Maxwell . After Maxwell's death in 1991, [[David Montgomery  newspaper executive |David Montgomery  became Mirror Group's CEO, and a period of cost-cutting and production changes ensued. The ''Mirror'' went through a protracted period of crisis before merging with the regional newspaper group Trinity to form [[Trinity Mirror  in 1999. Printing of the ''Daily'' and ''Sunday Mirror'' moved to Trinity Mirror's facilities in Watford and Oldham.  ===1995–2004=== [[File:Daily Mirror front page 24 June 1996.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Front page of the ''Mirror'' 24 June 1996, with headline ""ACHTUNG! SURRENDER For you Fritz, ze Euro 96 Championship is over"", and accompanying contribution from the editor, ""Mirror declares football war on Germany""  Under the editorship of [[Piers Morgan   from October 1995 to May 2004  the paper saw a number of controversies. Morgan was widely criticised and forced to apologise for the headline ""ACHTUNG! SURRENDER For you Fritz, ze Euro 96 Championship is over"" a day before [[England national football team|England  met [[Germany national football team|Germany  in a semi-final of the [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96  football championships.<ref name=""IHT""></ref>  In 2000, Morgan was the subject of an investigation after Suzy Jagger wrote a story in ''[[The Daily Telegraph '' revealing that he had bought [[pound sterling|£ 20,000 worth of shares in the computer company [[Viglen  soon before the ''Mirror'' 's 'City Slickers' column tipped Viglen as a good buy.<ref name=""lie""></ref> Morgan was found by the [[Press Complaints Commission  to have breached the Code of Conduct on financial journalism, but kept his job. The 'City Slickers' columnists, [[Anil Bhoyrul  and [[James Hipwell , were both found to have committed further breaches of the Code, and were sacked before the inquiry. In 2004, further enquiry by the [[Department of Trade and Industry  United Kingdom |Department of Trade and Industry  cleared Morgan from any charges.<ref name=""cleared""></ref> On 7 December 2005 Bhoyrul and Hipwell were convicted of conspiracy to breach the Financial Services Act. During the trial it emerged that Morgan had bought £67,000 worth of Viglen shares, emptying his bank account and investing under his wife's name too.<ref name=""lie2""></ref>  In 2002, the ''Mirror'' attempted to move mid-market, claiming to eschew the more trivial stories of show-business and gossip. The paper changed its masthead logo from red to black  and occasionally blue , in an attempt to dissociate itself from the term ""[[red tops|red top "", a term for a sensationalist mass-market tabloid.  On 6 April 2005, the red top came back.  Under then-editor [[Piers Morgan , the newspaper's editorial stance opposed the [[2003 invasion of Iraq , and ran many front pages critical of the war. It also gave financial support to the [[15 February 2003 anti-war protest , paying for a large screen and providing thousands of placards. Morgan re-hired [[John Pilger , who had been sacked during [[Robert Maxwell 's ownership of the Mirror titles. Despite such changes, Morgan was unable to halt the paper's decline in circulation, a decline shared by its direct [[Tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid  rivals ''[[The Sun  United Kingdom |The Sun '' and the ''[[Daily Star  United Kingdom |Daily Star ''.  Morgan was fired from the ''Mirror'' on 14 May 2004 after authorising the newspaper's publication of photographs allegedly showing [[Iraq i prisoners being abused by [[British Army  soldiers from the [[Queen's Lancashire Regiment . Within days the photographs were shown to be fakes. Under the headline ""SORRY.. WE WERE HOAXED"", the ''Mirror'' responded that it had fallen victim to a ""calculated and malicious hoax"" and apologised for the publication of the photographs.  ===2004–present=== The ''Mirror'' front page on 4 November 2004, after the re-election of [[George W. Bush  as U.S. President, read ""How can 59,054,087 people be so DUMB?"". It provided a list of states and their alleged average IQ, showing the Bush states all below average intelligence  except for [[Virginia  , and all [[John Kerry  states at or above average intelligence. The source for this table was ''[[The Economist '', though it was a hoax. [[Richard Wallace  journalist |Richard Wallace  became editor in 2004.  On 30 May 2012, Trinity Mirror announced the merger of the ''Daily Mirror'' and ''Sunday Mirror'' into a single seven-day-a-week title. Richard Wallace and Tina Weaver, the respective editors of the ''Daily Mirror'' and ''Sunday Mirror'', were simultaneously dismissed and [[Lloyd Embley , editor of ''The People'', appointed as editor of the combined title with immediate effect. In 2018, Reach plc acquired the Northern & Shell titles, including the Daily Express, which led to a number of editor moves across the stable. Lloyd Embley was then promoted to editor-in-chief across the entire group, and [[Alison Phillips   previously deputy editor-in-chief for the Trinity Mirror titles  was appointed editor of the Daily Mirror.  ==Political allegiance== The ''Daily Mirror'' has traditionally backed the [[Labour Party  UK |Labour Party  at general elections.  On 3 May 1979, the day of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|general election , the ''Daily Mirror'' urged its readers to vote for the governing Labour Party led by [[James Callaghan .<ref name=""century""/> As widely predicted by the opinion polls, Labour lost this election, which was won by the [[Conservative Party  UK |Conservative Party  and saw [[Margaret Thatcher  become Prime Minister.<ref name=""century""></ref> The ''Mirror''s continued support of the Labour government was in spite of its falling popularity over the previous few months which had been the result of the [[Winter of Discontent , where the country was crippled by numerous public sector strikes.  By the time of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election , Labour support was at a postwar low, partly due to the strong challenge by the recently formed [[SDP-Liberal Alliance . Despite this, the ''Daily Mirror'' remained loyal to Labour and urged its readers to vote for the party  now led by [[Michael Foot  , condemning the Thatcher-led Tory government for its ""waste of our nation"",<ref name=""century""/> condemning the rise in unemployment that Thatcher's Conservative government had seen in its first term in power largely due to [[Monetarism|monetarist  economic policies to reduce inflation, though the government's previously low popularity had dramatically improved since the success of the [[Falklands War|Falklands  conflict a year earlier. However, the Tories were re-elected and Labour suffered its worst postwar general election result, only narrowly bettering the SDP-Liberal Alliance in terms of votes, though winning considerably more seats.<ref name=""century""/>  At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election , the ''Daily Mirror'' remained loyal to Labour  now led by [[Neil Kinnock   and urged its readers ""You know he's right, chuck her out"".<ref name=""century""/> By this stage, unemployment was falling and inflation had remained low for several years. However, the Tories were re-elected for a third successive term, although Labour did cut the Tory majority slightly.<ref name=""century""/>  For the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election , the ''Daily Mirror'' continued to support Labour, still led by [[Neil Kinnock . By this stage [[Margaret Thatcher  had stepped down and the Tory government was now led by [[John Major .<ref name=""century""/> The election was won by the Tories, although Labour managed to significantly cut the Tory majority to 21 seats compared to the triple-digit figure of the previous two elections, which led to a difficult term for Major. The outcome of this election had been far less predictable than any of the previous three elections, as opinion polls over the previous three years had shown both parties in the lead, although any Labour lead in the polls had been relatively narrow since the Conservative government's change of leader from Thatcher to Major in November 1990, in spite of the onset of a [[Early 1990s recession|recession in 1990  which had pushed unemployment up again after several years of decline. Labour's credibility was helped by plans including extra [[National Health Service|NHS funding  and moving away from firm commitments on re-nationalisation to reverse the Conservative policy of privatisation, but its decision to be up-front about tax increases was seen as a key factor in its failure to win.  By the time of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election , support for the Labour Party, now led by [[Tony Blair , in the opinion polls had exceeded that of support for the Tory government  still led by John Major  since late 1992, the government's reduced popularity largely blamed on the failings of [[Black Wednesday  in September of that year and it had failed to recover popularity in spite of a strong economic recovery and fall in unemployment. A reinvented ""New Labour"" had further improved its credibility under Blair by promising traditional Labour essentials including more funding for healthcare and education, but also promising not to increase income tax and ending its commitment to the nationalisation of leading industries. The ''Daily Mirror'' urged its readers that their country needed Tony Blair, and to vote Labour.<ref name=""century""/> The election produced a Labour landslide and ended the party's 18-year exile from power.  On 4 May 2010, the newspaper printed a picture of Conservative leader [[David Cameron  with a giant red cross through his face. The headline read ""How to stop him"" in reference to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|general election two days later , thus confirming the ''Daily Mirror''s Labour allegiance. The election ended in Britain's first [[hung parliament  since [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|1974 , but Cameron still became prime minister of the country within days as the Conservatives formed a coalition with the [[Liberal Democrats  UK |Liberal Democrats . The ''Daily Mirror'' was the only leading national newspaper to remain loyal to Labour and [[Gordon Brown  at a time when opinion polls showed the party on course for their worst election result since [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 .  The newspaper was critical of the Liberal Democrats for forming the coalition which enabled the Conservatives to form a new government in 2010, and branded leader [[Nick Clegg  as Pinickio  alluding to the lying fictional character [[Pinocchio   for going back on numerous pre-election pledges. It has frequently referred to the party as the ""Fib Dems"" or ""Lib Dumbs"". The ''Daily Mirror'' endorsed Democratic candidate [[Hillary Clinton  in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In 2016 the newspapers asked for [[Jeremy Corbyn 's resignation ""for the good of Labour and of the country"".  Despite this critical position, in 2017 election the ''Daily Mirror'' endorsed the Labour Party.  ==Famous features==  * Cartoon strips ""[[Pip, Squeak and Wilfred ""  1919–56 , ""[[Jane  comic strip |Jane ""  1932–59 , ""[[Garth  comic strip |Garth ""  1943–97, reprints 2011 , ""[[Just Jake ""  1938–52 , ""[[Andy Capp ""  1957– , and ""[[The Perishers ""  1955–2006 and later reprints . * ""The Old Codgers"", a fictional pair who commented on the letters page from 1935 to 1990.<ref name=Gascoigne>[http://www.historyworld.net/Articles/PlainTextArticles.asp?aid=zah&pid=617 Bamber Gascoigne  1993  ''Encyclopedia of Britain''  Macmillan ]</ref> * Chalky White, who would wander around various British seaside resorts waiting to be recognised by Mirror readers  an obscured photo of him having been published in that day's paper .

This was done as a marketing exercise with [[Pepsi|Pepsi-Cola , who on the same day had decided to relaunch their cans with a blue design instead of the traditional red and white logo.  ==Libel, contempt of court, errors and criticism== [[File:The Daily Mirror - Sorry We Were Hoaxed.jpg|frame|right|upright|alt=Sorry We Were hoaxed|Front page of the ''Daily Mirror'' after publishing faked photographs.  * In the 1959 ''[[Liberace v Daily Mirror '' case, [[Liberace  sued the ''Mirror'' for libel. [[William Connor  had written a pseudonymous column hinting that the American entertainer was a homosexual; homosexuality was illegal in Britain at the time. The jury found in Liberace's favour and he received £8,000 in damage  estimated at around £500,000 in 2009 . * In 1991, shortly after the death of [[Queen  band |Queen <nowiki/>'s lead singer [[Freddie Mercury , the ''Daily Mirror'' ran a [[homophobia|homophobic  column by [[Joe Haines  which contained extensive insults towards Mercury, [[HIV/AIDS  victims, and homosexuals. The article prompted an open letter in condemnation from folk singer [[Lal Waterson , later recorded as a song by her sister [[Norma Waterson|Norma . * In December 1992, Scottish politician [[George Galloway  won libel damages from the ''Daily Mirror'' and its Scottish sister the ''Daily Record'', who had falsely accused him of making malicious allegations about their foreign editor [[Nicholas Davies  journalist |Nicholas Davies . Galloway had used [[parliamentary privilege  to call for an independent investigation into allegations about Davies made in the book [[The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy|''The Samson Option'' . * In May 2004, the ''Daily Mirror'' published what it claimed were photos of British soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners at an unspecified location in Iraq. The decision to publish the photos, subsequently shown to be hoaxes, led to Morgan's sacking as editor on 14 May 2004. The ''Daily Mirror'' then stated that it was the subject of a ""calculated and malicious hoax"". The newspaper issued a statement apologising for the printing of the pictures. The paper's deputy editor, [[Des Kelly , took over as acting editor during the crisis. The tabloid's rival, ''The Sun'', offered a £50,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of those accused of faking the ''Mirror'' photographs. * In June 2004, American model [[Caprice Bourret  won a libel case against the ''Daily Mirror'' for an article in April that year which falsely claimed that her acting career had failed. * In November 2007, the ''Daily Mirror'' paid damages to Sir Andrew Green after having likened him and his group [[MigrationWatch UK  to the [[Ku Klux Klan  and [[Nazi Party  in September of that year. The newspaper admitted that such allegations were ""untrue"". * In February 2008 both the ''Daily'' and the ''Sunday Mirror'' implied that TV presenter [[Kate Garraway  was having an affair. She sued for [[Defamation#United Kingdom|libel , receiving an apology and compensation payment in April 2008. * On 18 September 2008, David Anderson, a British sports journalist writing for the ''Mirror'', repeated a claim deriving from vandalism on Wikipedia's entry for Cypriot football team [[AC Omonia , which asserted that their fans were called ""The Zany Ones"" and liked to wear hats made from discarded shoes. The claim was part of Anderson's match preview ahead of AC Omonia's game with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City , which appeared in the web and print versions of the ''Mirror'', with the nickname also quoted in subsequent editions on 19 September. The episode was featured in ''[[Private Eye ''. * In November 2009, the ''Mirror'' paid ""substantial libel damages"" to Portuguese footballer [[Cristiano Ronaldo  after it admitted that a story about him becoming highly intoxicated in a Hollywood nightclub was untrue. * On 12 May 2011, the [[High Court of England and Wales  granted the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General  permission to bring a case for contempt against ''The Sun'' and the ''Daily Mirror'' for the way they had reported on the arrest of a person of interest in the [[Murder of Joanna Yeates . On 29 July, the Court ruled that both newspapers had been in contempt of court, fining the ''Daily Mirror'' £50,000 and ''The Sun'' £18,000. * In October 2013, a defamation case brought by the Irish airline [[Ryanair  against the ''Daily Mirror'' was settled out of court.

He later sued for defamation and libel, winning £54,650 in damages and a further £4,250 for a claim about his departure from ''[[Mock the Week ''. The ''Mirror'' had argued he was ""forced to quit"" but this was found to be libellous by the court. * On 20 March 2017 the ''Mirror'' painted the traditional Russian pancake celebration [[Maslenitsa  as a [[Hooligan  training ground. One of the centuries-old tradition in this Russian festival is “wall-to-wall”  ‘[[:ru:Стенка на стенку|stenka na stenku ’, Ru  which is sparring between men dressed in traditional folk clothes. This tradition was wrongly represented by the ''Mirror'' in the pictures and text, labelled as violent acts and living in fear without giving context or any information about this Russian traditional festival at all. The ''Mirror'' article was titled “Russia's Ultra yobs infiltrated amid warnings England fans could be KILLED at [[World Cup 2018|World Cup .”, and received negative receptions from Russian media, also being described as [[fake news . The organisers of the traditional Russian folk festival event are looking to sue the ''Daily Mirror'', it is reported later. Representatives of the ''Daily Mirror'' acknowledged that the original material of the publication about Russian Hooligans was incorrectly illustrated with images of the traditional festival. In the updated version of the article the newspaper continues to insist that the photographed people were hooligans in the pictures, but gives no evidence of their participation in the festival.  ==Significant staff members==  ===Editors===  :1903 to 1904: [[Mary Howarth  newspaper editor |Mary Howarth  :1904 to 1907: [[Hamilton Fyfe  :1907 to 1915: [[Alexander Kenealy  :1915 to 1916: [[Ed Flynn  journalist |Ed Flynn  :1916 to 1929: [[Alexander Campbell  journalist |Alexander Campbell  :1929 to 1931: [[Cameron Hogg  :1931 to 1934: [[Leigh Brownlee  :1934 to 1948: [[Cecil Thomas  journalist |Cecil Thomas  :1948 to 1953: [[Silvester Bolam  :1953 to 1961: [[Jack Nener  :1961 to 1971: [[Lee Howard  journalist |Lee Howard  :1971 to 1974: [[Tony Miles  journalist |Tony Miles  :1974 to 1975: [[Michael Christiansen  :1975 to 1985: [[Mike Molloy  :1985 to 1990: [[Richard Stott  :1990 to 1991: [[Roy Greenslade  :1991 to 1992: [[Richard Stott  :1992 to 1994: [[David Banks  journalist |David Banks  :1994 to 1996: [[Colin Myler  :1996 to 2004: [[Piers Morgan  :2004 to 2012: [[Richard Wallace  journalist |Richard Wallace  :2012 to 2018: [[Lloyd Embley  :2018 to date: [[Alison Phillips    Source: ''Tabloid Nation''<ref name=""tabloidnation""></ref>  ===Notable columnists=== Notable former and current columnists of the ''Daily Mirror'' include: * [[The 3AM Girls   gossip columnists  * [[William Connor   opinion under the pseudonym ''Cassandra''  1935–1967   * [[Caradoc Evans   1917–1923  * [[Richard Hammond   motoring and Saturday columnist  * [[Oliver Holt   sports columnist  * [[Kevin Maguire  journalist |Kevin Maguire   UK politics  * [[Penman & Greenwood   investigators  * [[Fiona Phillips   Saturday columnist  * [[Brian Reade   Thursday columnist; also does a sports column on Saturdays  * [[Keith Waterhouse   largely humorous  1993–2009   * [[Chris Hughes  journalist |Chris Hughes   security and defence   ==Awards== ''The Daily Mirror'' won ""Newspaper of the Year"" in 2002 at the [[British Press Awards .

It is owned by parent company Reach plc. From 1985 to 1987, and from 1997 to 2002, the title on its masthead was simply The Mirror. It had an average daily print circulation of 716,923 in December 2016, dropping markedly to 587,803 the following year. Its Sunday sister paper is the Sunday Mirror.  Unlike other major British tabloids such as The Sun and the Daily Mail, the Mirror has no separate Scottish edition; this function is performed by the Daily Record and Sunday Mail, which incorporate certain stories from the Mirror that are of Scottish significance. Originally pitched to the middle-class reader, it was converted into a working-class newspaper after 1934, in order to reach a larger audience. The Mirror has had a number of owners. It was founded by Alfred Harmsworth, who sold it to his brother Harold Harmsworth  from 1914 Lord Rothermere  in 1913. In 1963 a restructuring of the media interests of the Harmsworth family led to the Mirror becoming a part of International Publishing Corporation. During the mid 1960s, daily sales exceeded 5 million copies, a feat never repeated by it or any other daily  non-Sunday  British newspaper since. The Mirror was owned by Robert Maxwell between 1984 and 1991. The paper went through a protracted period of crisis after his death before merging with the regional newspaper group Trinity in 1999 to form Trinity Mirror. During the 1930s the paper was editorially sympathetic to Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists. The paper has consistently supported the Labour Party since the 1945 general election.  "

'''WRAL-TV''', [[virtual channel  5  [[ultra high frequency|UHF  [[digital terrestrial television|digital  channel 48 , is an [[NBC -[[network affiliate|affiliated  [[television station  [[city of license|licensed  to [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh , [[North Carolina , [[United States  and serving the [[Research Triangle|Triangle  region  Raleigh–[[Durham, North Carolina|Durham –[[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill –[[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville  . It is the [[flagship  broadcasting |flagship station  of the locally based [[Capitol Broadcasting Company , which has owned the station since its inception. WRAL-TV's studios are located at Capitol Broadcasting Company headquarters on Western Boulevard in West Raleigh, directly opposite the campus of [[North Carolina State University , and its [[transmitter  is located in [[Auburn, North Carolina|Auburn .  WRAL-TV is co-owned with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox  affiliate [[WRAZ  TV |WRAZ   channel 50, also licensed to Raleigh  and radio stations [[WRAL-FM   101.5&nbsp;MHz , [[WCMC-FM   99.9&nbsp;MHz , [[WDNC   620&nbsp;kHz , and [[WCLY   1550&nbsp;kHz . The operations of WRAZ and the radio stations are co-located at WRAL-TV's studios. WRAL-TV is available on [[cable television|cable  channel 3 in most of the Triangle, except in outlying areas of the market, where it is carried on channel 5. It is also available on cable in large portions of eastern areas of the state.  The station has been affiliated with NBC since February 29, 2016, when it ended a 30-year affiliation with [[CBS   the CBS affiliation has since been picked up by [[Goldsboro, North Carolina|Goldsboro -licensed [[WNCN , channel 17 . This is channel 5's second stint with NBC; it was affiliated with that network for six years at the station's inception, followed by a secondary affiliation with NBC for the next six years.  ==History==  ===Early years=== WRAL-TV began broadcasting on December 15, 1956. The first program aired was the [[feature film|movie  ''[[Miracle on 34th Street  1947 film |Miracle on 34th Street ''. A. J. Fletcher’s Capitol Broadcasting Company, which first licensed WRAL Radio  AM 1240, now [[WPJL   in 1938, won the TV license in an upset over the much larger Durham Life Insurance Company, then-owners of radio station [[WPTF .  WRAL was originally an NBC affiliate, taking that network from Durham-based [[WTVD   channel 11, which included Fletcher's son, Floyd, among its founders . When WNAO-TV  channel 28 , the Triangle's ABC affiliate, went dark at the end of 1957, WRAL shared [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC  with WTVD until August 1, 1962, when channel 5 took the ABC affiliation full-time. This was unusual for a two-station market. ABC was at the time the smallest and weakest of the three major networks; it would not be on par with NBC and CBS in terms of ratings or affiliated stations until the early 1970s. WRAL did continue to carry ''[[The Huntley-Brinkley Report '' until January 3, 1967, when ABC's own evening newscasts expanded to 30 minutes. WRAL also continued to carry ''[[My Three Sons '' for several years after that show switched to its eventual affiliate network of CBS.  From 1960 until his election to the [[United States Senate  in 1972, [[Jesse Helms  was an editorialist on WRAL-TV's news broadcasts. His [[conservatism in the United States|conservative  commentaries were both controversial and popular with many viewers.  ===Switch to CBS=== In March 1985, WTVD's owner, [[Capital Cities Communications , purchased ABC, resulting in WTVD becoming an [[owned-and-operated station  of that network. The CBS affiliation moved to WRAL-TV on August 4, 1985.  Within six months of the switch, WRAL-TV had become one of the strongest CBS affiliates in the country. It is one of the few stations in the country to have been a primary affiliate of all of the ""Big Three"" networks.  In December 1989, WRAL was knocked off the air when a severe [[ice storm  caused the collapse of the station's  transmitter tower. Within hours, channel 5 cut a deal with the then-struggling Fayetteville [[independent station  North America |independent station  WKFT-TV  channel 40, now [[Univision  O&O [[WUVC-DT  , allowing WRAL to return to the air in only three hours. WKFT ran the entire WRAL schedule during this time. The station's new, stronger tower was activated on October 25, 1990, at which point WKFT reverted to broadcasting its own programming.  In the early 1990s, WRAL distributed its programming via C-Band satellite as part of the [[Primetime 24  package, reaching viewers in the [[Caribbean  and [[Latin America , as well as the few rural areas of the United States and [[Canada  where local over-the-air broadcast signals were not available. It was replaced in the late 1990s with fellow CBS affiliate [[WSEE-TV  from [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie , [[Pennsylvania  primarily because of preemptions of network programming due to [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC  [[college basketball|basketball .  ===Return to NBC=== On January 15, 2016, WRAL-TV announced that it would switch to NBC on February 29, 2016. Concurrently, CBS announced that the existing NBC station, [[Media General -owned and [[Goldsboro, North Carolina|Goldsboro -licensed [[WNCN   channel 17 , would replace WRAL-TV as the Triangle's CBS affiliate the same day.<ref name=tvnc-wralswap></ref> Capitol Broadcasting president and CEO Jim Goodmon stated that CBS would only renew its affiliation with WRAL if it entered into a [[reverse compensation  agreement—under which Capitol would be required to pay the network for the local rights to air its programming. NBC, on the other hand, took the line that an affiliation deal was a partnership.  Goodmon saw the switch to NBC as ""a business decision for the future.""<ref name=""Nando""/>  WRAL officially rejoined NBC at 7 a.m. on February 29. In a ceremony at the end of the morning newscast, Goodmon pressed a button decorated with the [[NBC peacock  to switch to ''[[Today  U.S. TV program |Today ''.  [[Meredith College  professor Doug Spero suggested that WRAL's overall dominance in the Triangle was so absolute that it was in a position to become one of NBC's strongest affiliates, much as it was one of CBS' strongest affiliates.<ref name=""Nando""></ref> The feeling was mutual; according to [[NBC News  correspondent [[Harry Smith  US journalist |Harry Smith , NBC officials felt like they had ""just won the lottery"" when they learned WRAL was rejoining NBC. Indeed, on the first day of WRAL's return to NBC, several dayparts saw NBC jump from third to first in the Triangle ratings at one stroke.  Notably, ''Today'', the ''[[NBC Nightly News '', and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon '' immediately saw major ratings gains in the market after their move to WRAL.  The former two shows tallied their highest ratings on record in the Triangle on the day channel 5 officially returned to NBC, showing gains of well over 200 percent compared to their previous showings on WNCN. By contrast, CBS' competing programs lost more than half their audience share.<ref name=""tvspy-firstday""></ref>  The delay in the affiliation switch kept [[NFL on CBS|CBS' coverage  of [[Super Bowl 50 , which featured the [[Carolina Panthers   based in nearby [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte   as champions of the [[National Football Conference , on WRAL-TV. As an NBC station, channel 5 carried the [[2016 Summer Olympics  in [[Rio de Janeiro , [[Brazil , making it one of the few stations that aired the Super Bowl and Olympics from different networks in the same year.<ref name=""tvspy-sbolympics""></ref>  ==Digital television==  ===Digital channels=== The station's digital signal is [[Multiplex  TV |multiplexed : {| class=""wikitable"" |- !

The station, identified as ""WRAL-HD"", began digital television operations on [[Ultra high frequency|UHF  channel 32 over a month later, on July 23, 1996. The station's digital signal moved to channel 53 in March 2000.  WRAL-TV was the first in the U.S. to broadcast a live sports program in high definition  on September 6, 1997 , as well as the first HD newscast  on October 28, 2000 . CBS utilized WRAL-HD in testing its own high-definition programming, and in 1999, began providing the station with a regular schedule of primetime programs in HD. HD sports programming recorded by WRAL was provided to other model stations as well. WRAL-TV's pioneering efforts in digital television have won wide recognition from within the television industry  ===Analog-to-digital conversion=== WRAL-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over [[Very high frequency|VHF  channel 5, at 12:55&nbsp;p.m. on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States [[Digital television transition in the United States|transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts  under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 48. Through the use of [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP , digital television receivers continues to display the station's [[virtual channel  as its former VHF analog channel 5.1.  ====ATSC 3.0====  |  enddate                  = |  location                 = Raleigh/Durham/<br>Fayetteville, North Carolina |  callsign_meaning         = see WRAL-TV infobox |  owner                    = Capitol Broadcasting Company, Inc. |  sister_stations          = WCMC-FM, WRAL-FM, WRAZ |  former_callsigns         = |  former_affiliations      =  |  former_channel_numbers   =  |  effective_radiated_power = 40 kW |  HAAT                     =  |  facility_id              = 703425 |  coordinates              =   |  licensing_authority      = FCC |  homepage                 =    On June 29, 2016, WRAL became the first U.S. television station to begin broadcasting a full-time service using [[ATSC 3.0  digital television standards, operating under an experimental license from the FCC on UHF channel 39 as '''WRAL-EX'''. The service broadcasts two subchannels, including a simulcast of WRAL's main programming in [[1080p  high definition, and a demo loop of content in [[4K resolution|4K  [[ultra high-definition television , along with testing for NBC involving the [[2016 Summer Olympics  and [[2018 Winter Olympics .

The system allows emergency information including text, web pages and video to be distributed to compatible receivers using existing digital television signals.  ==Programming== WRAL clears most of the NBC schedule in pattern, except for one hour of ''[[The More You Know  block |The More You Know ''  NBC's [[E/I -compliant block , which it preempts in favor of [[infomercial|paid programming  in the noon hour on Saturdays  as a CBS affiliate, it cleared the network's entire schedule from the late 1990s until it rejoined NBC . The only exceptions involved ACC [[college football|football  and basketball from [[Raycom Media|Raycom Sports , both of which have aired on the station since 1982 when they moved from WTVD. ACC-preempted NBC programming aired either as originally scheduled on [[digital subchannel  5.2  which is otherwise an affiliate of [[Cozi TV   or overnights on the main signal. ''The More You Know'' is split over two days; the first hour airs on Saturdays from 10 to 11 a.m., with ''[[Brain Game  North Carolina |Brain Game '' and ''Smart Start Kids''  both of which count toward WRAL's E/I commitments  airing from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m., and the second hour airs on Sundays from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m.  However, the 2003 reality show ''Cupid'' did not air on the station, as have some controversial shows on sister station [[WRAZ  TV |WRAZ , and WRAL was one of a few CBS affiliates in the nation that did not carry an hour of CBS' weekend morning children's programming block  in favor of ''Brain Game'' and ''Smart Start Kids'' . WRAL was also one of the few CBS affiliates that aired ''[[The Young and the Restless '' at 4 p.m. as a lead-in to its 5 p.m. newscast. Most CBS stations in the [[Eastern Time Zone  air ''Y&R'' at 12:30&nbsp;p.m.  CBS's recommended time for the show , but in the case of WRAL, the timeslot switch occurred in January 1993. This happened because the station's sitcom reruns  the show being run at the time was an hour-long block of ''[[The Golden Girls ''  were having no luck against ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show '' on WTVD.  The second half of their noon newscast and ''Right This Minute'' aired in ''Y&R''s recommended time slot.  Today, ''Y&R'' continues to air at 4 p.m. on [[WNCN , while WRAL-TV carries local news at the time slot.  When WRAL joined CBS in 1985, it became the Triangle's home for the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament , which has aired on CBS since 1981. Due to the Triangle's  and North Carolina's  longstanding status as a college basketball hotbed and local teams [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina  and [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke  being fixtures in the tournament, NCAA Tournament games on WRAL were consistently among the highest-rated programs in the Triangle during tournament season. Despite the NCAA Tournament moving with the rest of the CBS schedule to WNCN, WRAL-TV continued to air ACC football and/or basketball.  WRAL has broadcast memorable locally produced children's programming throughout its storied history. Its most famous and longest-running is ''Time for Uncle Paul'', which ran from 1961 to 1981, and starred Paul Montgomery. He had played various other characters on other local shows before getting his own program. He voluntarily ended his program after station management suggested a change to an educational format.  Soon after, WRAL continued to produce acclaimed educational children's shows such as ''Frog Hollow'', ''Sparks'', and ''The Androgena Show''. Today, WRAL continues to produce educational programs with such shows as ''Smart Start Kids'' and ''Brain Game''. In recent years, WRAL and [[UNC-TV  have co-produced programming, such as the 2009 Gubernatorial Inauguration and the 2006 Parade of Sail Tall Ship Show in [[Beaufort, North Carolina|Beaufort . UNC-TV has, also, begun carrying WRAL's award winning ''Focal Point'' documentaries. WRAL has long been a corporate supporter of UNC-TV, often assisting them financially and occasionally with on-air talent during UNC-TV's yearly Festival telethon.  WRAL announced on February 1, 2006 that it would begin to stream all of its programming live on the internet. This signified the latest advances in technology-driven delivery of product by a local television station. A few months later, WRAL was selected to be the flagship station for [[North Carolina Education Lottery  drawings  twice daily for certain games, with the multi-jurisdictional [[Mega Millions  Tuesday and Friday nights, and [[Powerball  Wednesdays and Saturdays . On December 3, 2007, WRAL became the first local television station to stream live video to mobile phones.  WRAL's last program as a CBS affiliate after over 30 years on February 28, 2016 was the movie ''[[Last Vegas '', while the first program after rejoining NBC the following morning was ''The Today Show''; Goodmon himself punched the button that switched channel 5 to the NBC network feed.  Current [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated  programming offered on WRAL includes: ''[[Entertainment Tonight '', ''[[Inside Edition '', and ''[[The Doctors  2008 TV series |The Doctors '' among others. All are distributed by [[CBS Television Distribution ; WRAL's affiliation switch from CBS to NBC has not affected these shows' future on the channel.  ===''Football Friday''=== Debuting in 1981, each Friday evening following the 11:00&nbsp;p.m. news, [[Tom Suiter  hosts ''Football Friday'' covering all [[high school football  games throughout [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake  and [[Durham County, North Carolina|Durham  counties along with a dozen or more counties. WRAL crews spread out across the area providing not just scores but video coverage of each of 25 to as many as 35 games in the area. The show is an extension of the expansion throughout the 1980s of high school football coverage on the 11:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast. Each Friday, video crews are sent to cover two games each. WRAL videographers and sports reporters capture highlights of the first quarter of one game and second quarter of the other game. Editors have little more than an hour to prepare highlights. From 1995 through 2002, ''Football Friday'' was broadcast from WRAL's studio A with an audience of [[cheerleading|cheerleaders , [[marching band|bands , players and fans. The arrival of the [[North Carolina Education Lottery  moved the show to the newsroom.  ==News operation== WRAL-TV presently broadcasts 39½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week  with 6½ hours on weekdays, 3 hours on Saturdays and 4 hours on Sundays . WRAL has the highest rated television news organization in the Triangle<ref name=""nando sky5""></ref> winning numerous regional Emmys. Most recently, WRAL and wral.com were nominated 29 times for Mid South Regional Emmys.  Until his retirement on July 1, 1994, Charlie Gaddy co-anchored newscasts alongside Bobbie Battista, Adele Arakawa  now with KUSA-TV in Denver , Donna Gregory  who now works for NBC , and Pam Saulsby. Today David Crabtree  who replaced Gaddy in 1994 , Debra Morgan, and chief meteorologist Greg Fishel  who took over for retiring [[Bob DeBardelaben  in 1989 , are part of the longest-running on-air news team  news, weather, and sports  in the Triangle and one of the longest-running news teams in the state. Long time sports anchor Tom Suiter retired on December 18, 2008, and was replaced by Jeff Gravely, also a sports reporter and anchor for the 10pm news on WRAZ.  In September 1995, WRAL began to produce newscasts for [[WRAZ  TV |WRAZ . That station usually simulcasts local breaking news coverage from WRAL. For national breaking news events, WRAZ carries [[Fox News Channel|Fox News  coverage, while WRAL carries coverage from [[NBC News . Otherwise, WRAZ may broadcast NBC programming in case WRAL cannot do so as in news-related emergencies. The WRAZ broadcasts include a two-hour newscast at 7 a.m. weekday mornings and a weeknight hour-long, weekend half-hour newscast at 10 p.m., seven nights a week. WRAZ previously aired a 4 p.m. newscast on weekdays; however that newscast moved to WRAL on February 29, 2016, replacing ''[[The Young and the Restless ''.  WRAL was the first commercial station to provide [[High-definition television|high definition  programming when it obtained an experimental HD transmission license from the FCC in 1996. On October 13, 2000, WRAL aired the world's first all-HD newscast.<ref name=timeline></ref> On January 28, 2001, WRAL converted all of its newsgathering and broadcasts to all digital high definition<ref name=timeline/>  the WRAZ newscasts are broadcast in high definition as well . On November 17, 2006, WRAL had a special ""reunion"" newscast during the 6 p.m. broadcast with Gaddy, Battista and DeBardelaben reprising their roles once again in commemoration of the station's 50th anniversary alongside Suiter. On October 10, 2007, the WRAL sports department launched a sports talk radio station, [[WCMC-FM   which switched from a [[country music  format ; it is now is the only FM sports talk station in the area and broadcasts in [[HD Radio . WRAL's newscasts are simulcast with local weather inserts on another sister station, [[WILM-LD  in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington .  ===Agricultural coverage=== WRAL was one of the first stations in North Carolina to cover agricultural markets and farm news in its regular newscasts. Each day's noon newscast included a farm segment featuring each day's farm commodity prices, followed by a feature agricultural story from somewhere in the viewing area or around North Carolina. This grew WRAL's popularity in rural areas and with farmers, especially in Eastern North Carolina. The noon news farm broadcasts were anchored by veteran farm reporter [[Ray Wilkinson  and were dropped in the late 1990s, but farm segments were continued on the evening news broadcasts by Ray's son Dan Wilkinson. After the sudden unexpected death of Dan Wilkinson in October 2003, it was decided that the station would no longer have a full-time farm reporter and frequent agricultural coverage came to an end.  ===Sky 5=== In 1979, WRAL became the state's first television station to begin using a news helicopter, known as ""Sky 5"". The [[Hughes 500  helicopter  was painted in the livery of the [[Saudi Arabia n [[Royal Saudi Air Force|Air Force  with ""Sky 5"" graphics added, reflecting the original customer before the sale fell through and WRAL purchased it for newsgathering.<ref name=30years></ref><ref name=publicaffairs></ref>  The current [[Bell 407  helicopter was purchased for $2 million in 2000. The  tail number represents the station's channel, that this is the third news gathering helicopter for the station and WRAL's role in pioneering high definition broadcasting. The aircraft is piloted by Steve Wiley, who has flown for the station for 27 years. Today, the aircraft is normally stored at the [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport  but a helipad is available on the roof above the Capitol Broadcasting President's office in the WRAL buildings near downtown Raleigh.<ref name=""wralpeople""></ref> The helicopter is equipped with $600,000 worth of video equipment including cameras installed on the tail, two in the cabin and a [[gyroscope  controlled high definition camera under the nose, all of which can be controlled from the rear of the aircraft by a videographer. WRAL modified the helicopter to reach speeds of 130 miles per hour providing access to anywhere in the Triangle within seven minutes.<ref name=""nando sky5""/>  In over 30 years of electronic news gathering using helicopters, WRAL has had no significant incidents and remains one of the few stations to own rather than lease their helicopter. ""Sky 5"" has also participated in numerous search and rescue operations over the years at the request of local emergency officials before returning to newsgathering duties.<ref name=30years/><ref name=publicaffairs/>  ===Awards===  WRAL has received award nominations for news 32 times, tying [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville  station [[WTVF  in the 2012 Mid-South Regional [[Emmy Awards  and won 11. WRAL took home the Emmy for [[Rick Gall|News Excellence , Evening Newscast, Breaking News, Serious Feature News Report, Light Feature News Report, Light Feature News Series, Interactivity, Promo Spot News Same Day, Promo Spot News Image, Graphics Arts, and News Writing. Several of the 2012 Emmys came from coverage of the [[Tornado outbreak of April 14–16, 2011#Raleigh/Sanford, North Carolina area|April 2011 tornadoes  that ripped through the area. Parent company Capitol Broadcasting along with the [[A.J. Fletcher Foundation  were awarded the Governor's Award, the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' highest honor in 2012 as well.  In 1997 WRAL received eight Mid-South Regional Emmy Awards including those for news excellence, best newscast, best hard news series and investigative reporting. In 1998 WRAL received seven Mid-South Regional Emmy Awards including those for best daytime newscast, special event coverage, news magazine, news promotion, public service announcement, and best children's entertainment program.  WRAL was awarded nine Mid-South Regional Emmy Awards in 2000 including for documentaries on the Cape Light and coverage of the [[1999 Special Olympics World Summer Games|Special Olympics World Games . Jim Goodmon, president and CEO of WRAL parent company Capitol Broadcasting Company, Inc., was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award as well.  In 2008, among the nine Emmy awards received by WRAL and WRAL.com received the inaugural award in Advanced Media for Interactivity for the video player used throughout the website. The station also won a bronze Horizon Interactive Award for their online hurricane tracker.  Geoff Levine won the National Press Photographer of the Year award and the station received 6 awards from the North Carolina Associated Press Broadcasters.  WRAL has consistently swept television media categories in the ''[[Independent Weekly '' and ''[[Cary News '' annual ""Best Of"" awards voted by readers.  ===Notable current on-air staff=== * [[Bill Leslie  journalist |Bill Leslie  – anchor * [[Nate Johnson  meteorologist |Nate Johnson   AMS Certified Broadcast Meteorologist and NWA Seals of Approval  – meteorologist * [[Scott Mason  journalist |Scott Mason  - ''Tar Heel Traveler'' anchor/producer  ===Notable former on-air staff===  *[[Adele Arakawa  - anchor  1983–1989, now at [[KUSA-TV  in [[Denver   *[[Jim Axelrod  - political reporter  1993–1996, now with [[CBS News   *[[Bret Baier  - reporter  mid-1990s, now with [[Fox News Channel   *[[Bobbie Battista  - former co-anchor  1976–1981, joined [[CNN  in 1982 , now at [[The Onion News Network , the online news-satirical group. *[[Sandra Bookman  - weekend anchor/reporter  1985–1989, now at [[WABC-TV  in [[New York City|New York   *[[Rich Brenner  - sports anchor  1978–1981; deceased  *[[Dale Cardwell  - reporter  1985–1991, later at [[WSB-TV  in Atlanta.

Copies are also handed out to pedestrians.   ''Metro'' is owned by [[Daily Mail and General Trust  plc  DMGT , part of the same media group as the ''[[Daily Mail '' and ''[[The Mail on Sunday '', but in some areas ''Metro'' operates as a [[Franchising|franchise  with a local newspaper publisher, rather than as a wholly owned concern. While being a sister paper to the [[Conservatism|conservative  ''Daily Mail'', the newspaper has never endorsed any political party or candidate, and claims to take a neutral political stance in its reporting.<ref name=""pressgazette.co.uk"">[http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/who-says-millennials-dont-read-newspapers-editor-ted-young-on-the-rise-and-rise-of-metro/ Who says millennials don't read newspapers?] ''[[Press Gazette '' 24 March 2017</ref><ref name=""The Economist"" />  == History == [[File:Metro, The Free Newspaper delivery van - geograph.org.uk - 1248193.jpg|thumb|A ''Metro'' delivery van   ===Origins and London launch === The ''Metro'' free newspaper concept originated in Sweden, where a publication of the same name was launched in 1995 by [[Metro International . British newspaper executives Jonathan Harmsworth and Murdoch MacLennan, from [[DMGT , were reportedly inspired by the idea and flew to Stockholm on a 'fact-finding mission' with a view to developing their own version.<ref name=""The Guardian""></ref> There were also reports in the late 1990s that both [[Metro International  and [[Rupert Murdoch 's [[News International  were considering launching free newspapers in the UK which could be a commercial threat to [[DMGT 's businesses.<ref name=""Metro at ten""></ref>  [[DMGT  subsequently launched ''Metro'', using the same name as [[Metro International 's publications but with a different logo on Tuesday March 16, 1999. This UK version of ''Metro'' had no relation to [[Metro International  or its sister newspapers in other countries. ''Metro'' was launched initially as a London-only newspaper with an original print run of 85,000 copies, which were distributed via dedicated bins in London Underground stations.<ref name=""The Guardian""/> The newspaper was produced at [[DMGT 's printworks and office complex at [[Surrey Quays  in south east London, away from the company's main newspaper office in [[Kensington , west London.<ref name=""Metro at ten""/>  ===National expansion===  In the years following its launch, the paper's distribution was gradually expanded to other major UK cities, including Manchester and Birmingham. By February 2003 ''Metro'' became operationally profitable for the first time.<ref name=""Metro at ten""/> In 2004 its reach was extended further, becoming available in more urban areas including Nottingham, Bristol and Bath.  ''Metro'''s circulation continued to rise in the following years, although readership temporarily dipped after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings . There was a 1.8% decline - the equivalent of around 9,000 readers - in copies picked up in the weeks following the attacks due to a reduction in the number of people using London's public transport network, coupled with the temporary closure of some [[London Underground  lines where ''Metro'' was distributed.  Following several years of national expansion, in 2006 the newspaper's production was moved to [[DMGT 's main newspaper offices at [[Northcliffe House  in [[Kensington , west London.<ref name=""Metro at ten""/> That same year the newspaper expanded further, launching in [[Cardiff  and [[Liverpool  in joint venture deals with [[Trinity Mirror .<ref name=""Metro at ten""/>  At the time of its 10th anniversary in 2009, the newspaper was distributed in 16 ""major"" UK cities and its circulation had grown to 1.3 million. Despite the increase in readership, that same year management also closed five regional ''Metro'' offices in Manchester, Glasgow, Newcastle, Birmingham and Bristol, which were responsible for producing regionalised arts, entertainment and food pages, citing ""challenging economic conditions"".   By 2011 ''Metro'''s distribution network had expanded to more than 50 cities in the UK. That year media commentator [[Roy Greenslade  said the publication was now making ""bumper profits"" and dubbed it ""Britain's most successful national newspaper"".  ===Launch of Irish edition=== On 10 October 2005 ''Metro Ireland'' was launched in Dublin. It followed a legal battle over the title's name with the publishers of the ''Irish Independent'' and Dublin's ''Evening Herald'', which launched its own free newspaper called ''Herald AM''. Both titles were loss-making, despite having a combined circulation of 145,000 in the [[Greater Dublin Area . On 2 July 2009, it was announced that the two freesheets would merge under the ''Metro'' banner, an operation completed by 2010. However the Irish edition was closed down in December 2014.  ===London 2012 Olympic Games=== For the first time in its history, ''Metro'' temporarily published seven days a week during the [[2012 Summer Olympics  and the [[2012 Summer Paralympics , providing free copies to spectators at the Games as well as the general public. The newspaper struck a reported £2.25 million deal with sportswear manufacturer [[Adidas  to run cover wrap adverts on each of the 17 days of the Olympics.  === Rising circulation === After more than a decade in charge, editor Kenny Campbell was replaced as editor by [[Ted Young  journalist |Ted Young  in 2014. Young's appointment coincided with a number of changes at the newspaper, including the separation of the print and online editions, along with an expansion of ''Metro'''s distribution in the UK.<ref name=Guardian_2015></ref>  In November 2016, comedian [[Richard Herring  stepped down from writing his weekly column for ''Metro''. Fellow TV comedian [[Dom Joly  later replaced him in the slot.  In 2017, ''Metro'' became the most-read newspaper in the UK, according to monthly [[National Readership Survey  figures. In March 2018 ''Metro'' officially overtook ''[[The Sun  United Kingdom |The Sun '' in total print circulation, according to ABC  [[Audit Bureau of Circulations  UK    figures.<ref name=""The Economist""/>  == Content ==  ===Print edition=== The majority of the newspaper's content is produced at [[Northcliffe House  in [[Kensington , west London. There are no regional editions within England and Wales, except for occasional differences in sports and arts content catered to specific local audiences. A separate, small team produces a Scottish edition of ''Metro'', however often the only substantial difference between the two versions is the front page.  The newspaper is divided into three main sections—news, features and sport. The news section includes ''Guilty Pleasures'', which typically contains two or four pages of showbiz and entertainment news, a letters page, and a page dedicated for business news. A popular feature of the letters page is Rush Hour Crush, in which readers send in anonymous messages to fellow users of public transport who they consider attractive. The daily column has led to at least one marriage. The news section also features occasional feature columns from political pundits such as [[Sophy Ridge  of [[Sky News . However, while offering analysis, these columns do not typically express endorsements of political positions or candidates, thus not being considered as op-ed columns as in other newspapers.  The features section contains a mix of articles on travel, homes, style, and health, science, as well as arts coverage and entertainment listings. The puzzles page currently features a crossword and [[Sudoku .  ===Online=== Metro launched a website version of the newspaper in July 2001. Between 2001 and 2014 most print edition articles were published on this website, along with additional online-only content such as blogs and opinion columns.  In 2014 production of the newspaper and the website were separated. As a result, ''Metro'' newspaper and ''Metro Online'' are now produced by separate organisations and written independently by different editorial teams, while remaining part of the same parent company.  The newspaper's content is now published online on a separate website.  == Controversies ==  In the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015 , the-then [[UK Independence Party  leader [[Nigel Farage  refused to be interviewed by ''Metro'' after accusing the newspaper of being biased against his party. This was denied by the newspaper's editor. All other national party leaders agreed to be interviewed, including Conservative prime minister [[David Cameron  and Labour leader [[Ed Miliband .<ref name=""Guardian_2015""/>  Prior to the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016  ''Metro'' published a front-page cover-wrap advert on behalf of the Leave campaign, paid for by the [[Democratic Unionist Party . The following day the newspaper published another cover-wrap advert, this time from the Remain campaign. Editor [[Ted Young  journalist |Ted Young  said both adverts, which each cost more than £250,000 to place, generated around 300 complaints each, accusing the newspaper of both pro and anti Brexit bias.  Questions were subsequently raised as to why the [[Democratic Unionist Party  placed an advert in ''Metro'', because the newspaper does not publish in Northern Ireland.<ref name=Guardian_2017></ref>  == Competition ==  ''Metro'' has faced competition in parts of the UK from other free newspapers, along with rivalry from paid-for national titles. Current editor [[Ted Young  journalist |Ted Young  has said his 'mantra' is to produce a newspaper which its readers would be willing to pay for.<ref name=""pressgazette.co.uk""/>  [[Metro International  attempted to launch its own UK edition in 1999, being distributed in [[Newcastle upon Tyne 's [[Tyne & Wear Metro  system competing with [[DMGT 's ''Metro''. After battling alongside each other with the same name, Metro International's ''Metro'' changed its name to ''Morning News''. This attempt was short-lived however, and ''Morning News'' was discontinued shortly afterwards.  In 2005 [[Rupert Murdoch  said he was ""worried"" by competition from ''Metro'' and that it had damaged the circulation of his own newspaper ''The Sun''. He told a press conference he was watching the free newspaper market ""keenly and apprehensively"". Murdoch's [[News International  subsequently launched a London-based evening freesheet in 2006 called ''[[The London Paper ''. This was closed on 18 September 2009.  ''[[London Lite '' was another free, evening newspaper published in central London only from 2006 to 2009, at the time owned by the same parent company as ''Metro'', and was seen as a 'spoiler' to protect against the commercial threat from ''The London Paper''.  Another rival is the ''[[London Evening Standard '', which became a freesheet in 2009, although unlike ''Metro'' it is only published in the London region.  == App products ''11versus11'' and ''Guilty Pleasures'' == Metro launched two new mobile app products in 2016: 11versus11, which is a football news app, and Guilty Pleasures, a celebrity news app. Both apps offer personalised content based on a user's interest profile. 11versus11 won the Best Lifestyle, Sports & Entertainment App award at the 2017 European Digital Media Awards.  ==Editors== : :1999: [[Ian MacGregor  journalist |Ian MacGregor  :2001: Kenny Campbell :2014: [[Ted Young  journalist |Ted Young   ==See also== *''[[Digitiser ''  ==References==   == External links == * [https://www.metro.news metro.news] Website with all Metro newspaper and app content  * [http://e-edition.metro.co.uk Metro e-edition] Print e-edition and archive of Associated Newspapers' Metro newspaper * [http://metro.co.uk/ metro.co.uk] Owned by Associated Newspapers but separate from Metro print edition * [https://twitter.com/MetroUKNews @MetroUKNews] Metro newspaper Twitter account           [[Category:Daily Mail and General Trust  [[Category:Free daily newspapers  [[Category:Media in Newcastle upon Tyne  [[Category:Newspapers published in Ireland  [[Category:Media in Dublin  city   [[Category:London newspapers  [[Category:Publications established in 1999  [[Category:1999 establishments in the United Kingdom  [[Category:Daily newspapers published in the United Kingdom ","Metro is the United Kingdom's highest-circulation newspaper,  published in tabloid format by DMG Media.

The ''Register,'' published in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim , is owned by [[Digital First Media . [[Freedom Communications  owned the newspaper from 1935 to 2016.   ==History== The ''Register'' was founded by a consortium as the ''Santa Ana Daily Register'' in 1905. It was sold to J.P. Baumgartner in 1906 and to J. Frank Burke in 1927. In 1935 it was bought by [[Raymond C. Hoiles , who renamed it the ''Santa Ana Register'' and reorganized his holdings as Freedom Newspapers, Inc., in 1950, later Freedom Communications. The paper dropped ""Santa Ana"" from its title in 1952.  In 1956, the newspaper was a prominent supporter of a vociferous campaign by anti-communists against the [[Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act , claiming that it was part of a Communist plot to establish concentration camps in [[Alaska . Circulation rose with the burgeoning population of [[Orange County, California|Orange County  and after the ''Register'' added a morning edition in 1959.   In 1970 Hoiles' son, Clarence, became co-publisher with his brother Harry until 1979, when R.&nbsp;David Threshie, Clarence's son-in-law, was named to the position.  ===1980s=== Faced with an aggressive push into the county by the ''[[Los Angeles Times '' under then-publisher Otis Chandler, Threshie brought in 30-year-old N. Christian Anderson III as editor. Political positions were restricted to the editorial page. In 1981, the paper began publishing in full color.  In 1985, the paper assumed the name ''The Orange County Register''. In the same year it won its first [[Pulitzer Prize , for its photographic coverage of the [[1984 Summer Olympics  in Los Angeles. It won additional Pulitzers in 1989 for beat reporting by Edward Humes on U.S. military problems with [[night vision device|night-vision goggles  and in 1996 for an investigation into [[Ricardo Asch 's fertility clinics.  ===1990s=== In 1990, the newspaper launched the 24-hour OCN news channel with news and feature stories about Orange County. It closed in 2001.  In 1992, Orange County Register Communications launched ''[[Excélsior ,'' a Spanish-language weekly.  In 2010 ''Excélsior'' had a circulation of 51,000. It covers Orange County's growing Hispanic community, which now numbers over a million. Julio Saenz is the editor and general manager.  In 1999, Threshie became Chairman of the Board of Freedom Communications, and N. Christian Anderson III assumed the position of publisher and [[chief executive officer .   ===2000s=== Ken Brusic was named vice president of content and executive editor in April 2002. In 2003, a family schism led to a sale on Oct. 9th of a majority interest in Freedom Communications to investors led by the [[Blackstone Group  and [[Providence Equity Partners . Through a stock arrangement, the Hoiles family descendants retained control of the board.  In 2006, Orange County Register Communications launched the ''[[OC Post '', a tabloid with shortened versions of ''Register'' stories as well as news articles from the [[Associated Press . The paper also had its first significant staff reductions in December 2006, with 40 newsroom employees taking buyouts, along with a small number of layoffs.  By April 2007, ''The Orange County Register'' had made cuts to help maintain shareholder profit, which had averaged more than 20 percent annually in the preceding five years. Since the launch of the ''[[OC Post '' in 2006, OCRC has cut the ''Register's'' editorial staff by 10 percent, eliminated its 3% holiday bonuses for editorial staff. and postponed pay raises to editorial staff, which had averaged 3 percent annually, for six months. In September 2007, Terry Horne replaced N. Christian Anderson III as publisher.  In June 2008, [[KTLA , ''[[The Los Angeles Times '' and [[Fox News  reported that the ''Register'' had begun a one-month trial of outsourcing some layout and copy-editing work to India to save costs. The trial was not deemed a success, and since then editing has been done by the ''Register'' in Orange County. In spring of 2009, [[Freedom Communications  instituted furloughs for all employees nationwide, followed by a permanent 5% pay cut starting in July 2009. News reports in August 2009 indicated that Freedom Communications planned to file for bankruptcy and turn control of its publications, including ''The Orange County Register'', over to its lenders.  In September 2009, a column written by sports columnist Mark Whicker caused controversy. In the column, Whicker wrote about various sporting events that had occurred over the preceding 18 years, and how they had been missed by [[Jaycee Dugard , a girl who had been kidnapped, raped, and forced to bear her kidnapper's children. Whicker ended his column with the line ""Jaycee, you have left the yard."" The column generated widespread criticism and was parodied in blogs such as [[Deadspin , who called it ""the single worst piece of journalism ever committed on this page,"" and ''[[The Huffington Post ''.  ===2010s=== On July 25, 2012, ''The Orange County Register'' and six other papers were purchased by 2100 Trust LLC. The papers continued to operate under the Freedom Communications name.<ref name=FormerOC>[http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/01/business/la-fi-oc-register-lawsuit-20131102 Ken Bensinger, ""O.C.

The ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote that Kushner, ""a former greeting-card executive with no prior media experience,"" claimed that the prior owners had given him ""inaccurate valuations for a host of crucial financial indicators"" and that he faced ""$62.3 million in unexpected financial liabilities as a result.""<ref name=FormerOC /> On August 19, 2013, the ''Long Beach Register'' was launched as an edition of the ''Orange County Register'' serving the [[Long Beach, California , community. It was focused solely on community news, including city government, public and private education, local sports coverage, business and entertainment as an intended competitor to the ''[[Long Beach Press-Telegram ''. In addition, on January 20, 2014, ''[[The Press-Enterprise '' became an edition of the ''Orange County Register'' while maintaining coverage of the [[Inland Empire .<ref name=RPE></ref>  On April 16, 2014, the ''Orange County Register'' launched the ''Los Angeles Register'', ""more a print play than a digital one"" serving [[Los Angeles County . It was the first time since the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Herald-Examiner '' folded on November 1, 1989, that a main competitor to the ''[[Los Angeles Times '' was launched, this time intended to be ""as local as one edition can be for the entire county.""<ref name=LAR1></ref> Five months later, Kushner announced in a company memo that the ''Los Angeles Register'' was ending publication effective immediately. Kushner wrote that ""pundits and local competitors"" will be quick to call the effort a failure while he believes that ""not taking bold steps toward growth"" would have been the true failure.<ref name=LAR2></ref> The ''Long Beach Register'' became a Sunday-only publication in June 2014, and ceased publication in December 2014.<ref name=""LBRstops""></ref> In October the ''Los Angeles Times'' sued the ''Register'' for failing to pay more than $2 million to the ''Times'' for delivery services for the now-defunct Register newspapers in Los Angeles and Long Beach. In March 2014 the Los Angeles Superior Court granted the ''Times'' a $4.2 million [[writ of attachment  to secure the ability of the ''Times'' to enforce a possible judgment in its favor.  On March 10, 2015, Aaron Kushner and his partner, Eric Spitz, resigned from executive duties at the paper and Freedom Communications Inc. The company was rumored to be readying itself for a potential sale. Publisher Rich Mirman, a former Las Vegas casino executive who had invested in Freedom, was announced as the new president and chief executive.  On February 12, 2016, Freedom Communications announced that the ''Orange County Register'' and the ''Press-Enterprise'' along with its websites, community weeklies and the two Spanish-Language weeklies ''Excelsior'' in Orange County and ''La Prensa'' in the Inland Empire, were being placed in a ""stalking horse"" auction after the company declared bankrupt at the end of 2015. Both Digital First Media and Tribune Publishing were the bidders. The auction started on March 21 and was completed on March 31, 2016. On March 21, 2016, [[Digital First Media  acquired both the ''Orange County Register'' and the ''Press-Enterprise'' for $52.3 million in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court in [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana . The U.S. Department of Justice blocked the sale of Freedom Communications to [[Tribune Publishing  because it would create a newspaper monopoly in both Orange and Riverside Counties. Los Angeles News Group was renamed Southern California News Group on March 31, 2016, once the sale of Freedom Communications to Digital First Media was completed. It has 11 paid regional dailies, and community weeklies serving the South Bay communities of Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach and Palos Verdes Peninsula, the Long Beach neighborhoods north and east of downtown and over 20 community weeklies in Orange County, as well as the Spanish-language weeklies ''Impacto USA'' and ''Unidos'', now consolidated as ''Excelsior'', which will have three editions for Los Angeles County, Orange County and Inland Empire. On Sept. 21, 2016, it was announced that the Register would move its headquarters to 2190 Towne Centre Place, Anaheim, and vacate its longtime home at 625 N. Grand Ave., Santa Ana. The new headquarters opened April 24, 2017.  ==Editorial stances== The ''Register'' was notable for its generally [[Libertarianism|libertarian -leaning editorial page. Although it sometimes supported Republican politicians and positions, it was the largest newspaper in the country to have opposed the [[Iraq War  from the beginning and opposed laws regulating issues such as prostitution and [[Drug addiction|drug use . It was one of a handful of newspapers that opposed the [[Japanese American internment|internment of Japanese aliens and Japanese-Americans  during [[World War II .<ref name=""LA Times""></ref><ref name=""NY Times""></ref> It also opposed [[California Proposition 8  2008 |Proposition 8  in 2008, which proposed a ban on [[same-sex marriage .<ref name=""No on Prop 8""></ref> After the Digital First purchase of Freedom Communications, the ''Register''s editorial page was merged with that of the ''Los Angeles Daily News'' and Digital First's other papers in the region to form a single editorial board for the [[Southern California News Group  on regional and national issues.  ==Other publications== In addition to publishing the ''Orange County Register'', [[Southern California News Group  publishes ''OC Family'' magazine, ''Coast'' magazine, and the following affiliated weeklies:  ** ''Anaheim Bulletin'' of [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim  ** ''Coastal Current''  North and South editions  of [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach <ref name=""dimartino""></ref> ** ''North County News Tribune'' of [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton  ** ''Irvine World News'' of [[Irvine, California|Irvine <ref name=""dimartino""/> ** ''Laguna Woods Globe'' of [[Laguna Woods, California|Laguna Woods  ** ''Saddleback Valley News'' of [[Lake Forest, California|Lake Forest /[[Mission Viejo, California|Mission Viejo <ref name=""meg1"">[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-18/business/fi-343_1_media-general Media General Puts 31 Papers, Including 13 in County, Up for Sale]</ref><ref name =meg2>[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-29/business/fi-229_1_orange-county Owner of Orange County Register Buys 30 Weeklies]</ref> ** ''The Wave'' of [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach   ==Online content== On April 1, 2013, the ''Orange County Register'' began providing its online content through a metered [[paywall .

Its founding publisher, [[News Corporation , debuted the title on September 18, 1995. Originally edited by founders [[Bill Kristol  and [[Fred Barnes  journalist |Fred Barnes , the ''Standard'' had been described as a ""redoubt of [[neoconservatism "" and as ""the neo-con bible."" It was owned by MediaDC, a subsidiary of Clarity Media Group, itself a subsidiary of [[The Anschutz Corporation . On December 14, 2018, its owners announced that the magazine was ceasing publication, with the last issue published on December 17.  Many of the magazine's articles were written by members of conservative think tanks located in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington , including the [[American Enterprise Institute , the [[Ethics and Public Policy Center , the [[Foundation for Defense of Democracies , the [[Hudson Institute , and the [[Foreign Policy Initiative . Individuals who wrote for the magazine included [[Elliott Abrams , [[Peter Berkowitz , [[John R. Bolton , [[Ellen Bork , [[David Brooks  commentator |David Brooks , [[Gertrude Himmelfarb , [[Christopher Hitchens , [[Harvey Mansfield , [[Cynthia Ozick , [[Joe Queenan , and [[John Yoo . The magazine's website also produced regular online-only commentaries and news articles. The site's editorial stance was described as [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative .  ==History==  The ''Standard'' was viewed as heavily influential during the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|administration of George W. Bush   2001-2009 , being called the [[Inflight magazine|in-flight magazine  of [[Air Force One .<ref name="":0""></ref> In 2003, although the magazine's circulation was only 55,000, Kristol said that ""We have a funny relationship with the top tier of the administration. They very much keep us at arm's length, but [Vice President] [[Dick Cheney  does send over someone to pick up 30 copies of the magazine every Monday.""  In 2006, though the publication had never been profitable and reputedly lost more than a million dollars a year, News Corporation head [[Rupert Murdoch  dismissed the idea of selling it.  In June 2009, a report circulated that a sale of the publication to [[Philip Anschutz  was imminent, with Murdoch's position being that, having purchased ''[[The Wall Street Journal '' in 2007, his interest in the smaller publication had diminished. ''[[The Washington Examiner '' reported that month that the ''Examiner''s parent company, the Anschutz-owned Clarity Media Group, had purchased the ''Standard''; the price was about $1 million.  The ''Standard'' increased its paid circulation by 39 percent between its June 2009 and June 2010 [[BPA Worldwide|BPA  statements. Its print circulation of about 100,000 in 2013 had decreased to 72,000 by 2017, according to the BPA, with circulation dropping about 10 percent between 2016 and 2017.<ref name="":0"" />  In late 2016, Kristol ended his time as editor-in-chief. He was replaced by Stephen Hayes, the magazine's senior writer. Under Hayes' leadership, the ''Standard'' continued to be critical of Donald Trump; Trump's supporters in turn criticized the ''Standard'', and the magazine's influence in Republican circles dwindled.  In December 2017, ''The Weekly Standard'' became an official fact-checking partner for [[Facebook .   On December 14, 2018, Clarity Media Group announced that it would cease publication of the magazine after 23 years. The closure of ''The Weekly Standard'' was so Clarity Media's other magazine, the ''[[Washington Examiner '', could absorb the ''Standard''s subscribers.   ===Support of the invasion of Iraq===  The ''Standard'' promoted and supported the invasion of Iraq to remove [[Saddam Hussein .    In November 1997 [[Bill Kristol  and [[Robert Kagan  wrote an editorial titled ""Saddam Must Go"", in which they stated ""We know it seems unthinkable to propose another ground attack to take Baghdad. But it’s time to start thinking the unthinkable.""  In the first issue the magazine published after 9/11, according to [[Scott McConnell  of ''[[The American Conservative '', ""[[Gary Schmitt  and [[Giselle Donnelly|Tom Donnelly , two employees of Kristol’s [[Project for the New American Century|PNAC , clarified what ought to be the country’s war aims. Their rhetoric was to link Saddam Hussein and [[Osama bin Laden  in virtually every paragraph, to join them at the hip in the minds of readers, and then to lay out a strategy that actually gave attacking Saddam priority over eliminating al-Qaeda.""  On December 16, 2018, co-founder and contributing editor [[John Podhoretz  defended the coverage answering the question by [[Lulu Garcia-Navarro  on [[NPR : ""Do you regret the coverage of Iraq War?"" saying ""I think, basically, what - all a magazine - editors, writers - can promise is that they will be honest and say what they mean and think and argue the best way that they can. And with the facts available at the time, that is what The ''Standard'' did.""  ===Libel case=== In 1997, nearly a year after a cover story that included allegations of hiring a prostitute and plagiarism against best-selling author [[Deepak Chopra , the editors of ''The Weekly Standard'' accepted full responsibility for the errors in the story, and apologized.""

He had become ill in his office just a few hours after he helped break ground for the new St. Petersburg campus of the [[University of South Florida .

The following year [[Alan Bond  businessman |Alan Bond , through Bond Corporation, gained control of Bell Group and hence the paper. This ownership structure only survived for a few years until the collapse of Bond Corporation. A newly formed company, ''West Australian Newspapers Holdings'', then purchased the paper from the receivers before being [[initial public offering|floated  in an oversubscribed $185 million public offering.<ref name=""175 years of The West Australian"">[http://www.australian-media.com.au/index.php?c=home&p=news&article=7823 175 years of The West Australian]</ref> Chairman [[Trevor Eastwood  announced in the annual report that the company was listed on the [[Australian Securities Exchange     on 9 January 1992.

After having acquired [[Seven Media Group  in February 2011, West Australian Newspapers Holdings Limited became [[Seven West Media , Australia's largest diversified media business.  == History == [[Image:PerthGazette 1833 06 01 1 masthead.jpg|thumb|Masthead from the ''Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal'', published Saturday 1 June 1833.   ''The West Australian'' traces its origins to '''''The Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal''''', the first edition of which appeared on 5 January 1833. Owned and edited by Perth [[postmaster  [[Charles Macfaull , it was originally a four-page weekly. It was, at first, published on Saturdays, but changed to Fridays in 1864. From 7 October 1864 it was known as '''''The Perth Gazette and Western Australian Times''''' and was published by Arthur Shenton, until 24 March 1871, after which the publisher was Joseph Mitchell, until 29 September 1871. The new publisher, M. Shenton, remained in place until 26 June 1874. when it was bought by a syndicate who renamed it '''''The Western Australian Times''''' and who in September 1874 increased production to two editions a week.  On 18 November 1879, it was relaunched as '''''The West Australian'''''. In October 1883, production was increased to three editions per week; two years later it became a daily publication. The proprietors of the ''West Australian'' at that time also inaugurated the '''''[[Western Mail  Western Australia |Western Mail ''''', in 1885. Initially, delivery of the paper beyond settled areas was problematic, but the growth and development of the rural railway system in the early 1900s facilitated wider circulation.  === Locations === [[File:Newspaper house gnangarra-10.jpg|thumb|upright|Clock on the former premises, Newspaper House, [[St Georges Terrace   Newspaper House, the former office and publishing plant of ''The West'' on [[St Georges Terrace , across the road from the [[Palace Hotel, Perth|Palace Hotel , was a prominent landmark in the life of the city and state for over 50 years. It was vacated in the mid-1980s for the ill-fated [[Old Perth Technical School#Redevelopment progress|""Westralia Square""  redevelopment which was completed in 2012 under the name [[Brookfield Place  Perth |Brookfield Place . The editorial staff was temporarily relocated in a nearby office building. Recognised as part of an important heritage precinct, Newspaper House was scheduled for preservation and refurbishment.  In 1988, larger and more modern accommodation for the paper's printing presses was commissioned in [[Osborne Park, Western Australia|Osborne Park . Ten years later, the editorial operations also moved to the Osborne Park complex.<ref name=""175 years of The West Australian""/>  === Acquisitions === In September 2015 the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  approved the acquisition of ''[[The Sunday Times  Australia |The Sunday Times '', which would give Seven West Media a monopoly over major newspapers in the state. Finalisation of the deal, which includes the website [[PerthNow , was announced by ''The West'' on 8 November 2016.  === Circulation and profits slump === ''The West'' recorded a significant fall of nearly 25% in profit in June 2016. A serious drop in circulation was also reported with average weekday circulation down from 157,000 to 145,000, while the weekend edition averaged 241,000, down from 258,000.

It was first published as a broadsheet in 1900 by [[Sir Arthur Pearson, 1st Baronet|Sir Arthur Pearson . Its sister paper, the '''''Sunday Express''''', was launched in 1918. In February 2019, it had an average daily circulation of 315,142.<ref name=""circ""></ref>  The paper was acquired by [[Richard Desmond  in 2000. [[Hugh Whittow   was the editor from February 2011 until he retired in March 2018. [[Gary Jones  journalist |Gary Jones  took over as editor-in-chief in March 2018.

In addition to its sister paper, Express Newspapers also publishes the [[Red tops|red top newspapers  the ''[[Daily Star  British newspaper |Daily Star '' and ''[[Daily Star Sunday ''.  ==History== [[File:Express Building Manchester.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Exterior of [[Owen Williams  engineer |Owen Williams ' [[Daily Express Building, Manchester|Daily Express Building  in Manchester.  [[File:Express Building.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Exterior of [[Daily Express Building, London|Daily Express Building  in London, designed by Ellis and Clark. The ''Daily Express'' was founded in 1900 by [[Sir Arthur Pearson, 1st Baronet|Sir Arthur Pearson , with the first issue appearing on 24 April 1900. Pearson, who had lost his sight to [[glaucoma  in 1913, sold the title to the future [[Max Aitken|Lord Beaverbrook  in 1916.<ref name=""FOB""></ref>      It was one of the first papers to place news instead of advertisements on its front page<ref name=""FOB""/>, and  carried gossip, sport, and women's features. It was also the first in Britain to have a [[crossword|crossword puzzle .  The ''Express'' began printing in Manchester in 1927. In 1931 it moved to [[Daily Express Building, London|120 Fleet Street , a specially commissioned [[art deco  building. Under Beaverbrook, the paper set newspaper sales records several times throughout the 1930s.<ref name=""hist""></ref> Its success was partly due to aggressive marketing campaign and a circulation war with other populist newspapers. Arthur Christiansen became editor in October 1933. Under his direction sales climbed from two million in 1936 to four million in 1949. He retired in 1957. The paper also featured [[Alfred Bestall 's ''[[Rupert Bear '' cartoon and satirical cartoons by [[Carl Giles  which it began publishing in the 1940s. On 24 March 1933, a front-page headline, ""Judea Declares War on Germany""  because of the [[Anti-Nazi boycott of 1933  , was published.   During the late 1930s, the paper advocated the [[appeasement  policies of the Chamberlain government, due to the influence of Lord Beaverbrook.   The ruralist author [[Henry Williamson  wrote for the paper on many occasions for half a century, practically the whole of his career. He also wrote for the ''Sunday Express'' at the beginning of his career.  In 1938, the publication moved to the [[Daily Express Building, Manchester   nicknamed the 'Black Lubyianka'  designed by [[Owen Williams  engineer |Owen Williams  on the same site in [[Great Ancoats Street . It opened a similar building in Glasgow in 1936 in Albion Street. Glasgow printing ended in 1974 and Manchester in 1989 on the company's own presses. Johnston Press has a five-year deal, begun in March 2015, to print the northern editions of the ''Daily Express'', ''Daily Star'', ''Sunday Express'' and the ''Daily Star Sunday'' at its Dinnington site in Sheffield. The Scottish edition is printed by facsimile in Glasgow by contract printers, the London editions at Westferry Printers.  In March 1962, Beaverbrook was attacked in the House of Commons for running ""a sustained vendetta"" against the [[British Royal Family  in the ''Express'' titles. In the same month, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh  described the ''Express'' as ""a bloody awful newspaper. It is full of lies, scandal and imagination. It is a vicious paper."" At the height of Beaverbrook's control, in 1948, he told a [[Royal Commission  on the press that he ran his papers ""purely for the purpose of making propaganda"".<ref name=""Beers""></ref><ref name=""adammatthew5""></ref> The arrival of television, and the public's changing interests, took their toll on circulation, and following Beaverbrook's death in 1964, the paper's circulation declined for several years. During this period, the ''Express'', practically alone among mainstream newspapers, was vehemently opposed to entry into what became the [[European Economic Community .<ref name=""hist"" />    Partially as a result of the rejuvenation of the ''Daily Mail'' under [[David English  editor |David English  and the emergence of ''[[The Sun  United Kingdom |The Sun '' under [[Rupert Murdoch  and editorship of [[Larry Lamb  newspaper editor |Larry Lamb , average daily sales of the ''Express'' dropped below four million in 1967, below three million in 1975, and below two million in 1984.  The ''Daily Express'' switched from [[broadsheet  to tabloid in 1977  the ''Mail'' having done so six years earlier , and was bought by the construction company [[Trafalgar House  company |Trafalgar House  in the same year. Its publishing company, Beaverbrook Newspapers, was renamed Express Newspapers. In 1982, Trafalgar House spun off its publishing interests to a new company, Fleet Holdings, under [[Victor Matthews, Baron Matthews|Lord Matthews , but this succumbed to a hostile takeover by [[United Newspapers  in 1985. Under United, the ''Express'' titles moved from Fleet Street to [[Blackfriars Road  in 1989.  Express Newspapers was sold to publisher [[Richard Desmond  in 2000, and the names of the newspapers reverted to ''Daily Express'' and ''Sunday Express''. In 2004, the newspaper moved to its present location on Lower Thames Street in the [[City of London .<ref name=""hist"" />  On 31 October 2005, UK Media Group [[Entertainment Rights  secured majority interest from the ''Daily Express'' for [[Rupert Bear . They paid £6&nbsp;million for a 66.6% control of the character. The ''Express'' retains minority interest of one-third plus the right to publish Rupert Bear stories in certain Express publications.  ===Richard Desmond era=== [[File:Chancellor George Osborne and Richard Desmond.jpg|thumb|In 2000, Express Newspapers was bought by [[Richard Desmond   ''left''   In 2000, Express Newspapers was bought by Richard Desmond, publisher of celebrity magazine ''[[OK! '', for £125 million. Controversy surrounded the deal since Desmond also owned [[softcore pornography  magazines. As a result, many staff left, including editor [[Rosie Boycott  and columnist [[Peter Hitchens  . Hitchens moved to ''[[The Mail on Sunday '', saying working for the new owner was a moral conflict of interest since he had always attacked the pornographic magazines that Desmond published. Despite their divergent politics, Desmond respected Hitchens.  In 2007, Express Newspapers left the [[National Publishers Association  due to unpaid fees. Since payments to the NPA fund the [[Press Complaints Commission , it is possible that the ''Express'' and its sister papers could cease being regulated by the PCC. The chairman of the [[Press Standards Board of Finance , which manages PCC funds, described Express Newspapers as a ""rogue publisher"".  The Express group lost prominent libel cases in 2008–2009; it paid damages to people involved in the [[Disappearance of Madeleine McCann|Madeleine McCann  case  see below , a member of the [[Muslim Council of Britain , footballer [[Marco Materazzi , and sports agent [[Willie McKay . The losses led the media commentator [[Roy Greenslade  to conclude that Express Newspapers  which also publishes the ''Star'' titles  paid more in libel damages over that period than any other newspaper group. Although most of the individual amounts paid were not disclosed, the total damages were recorded at £1,570,000.<ref name=""Greenslade""> </ref> Greenslade characterised Desmond as a ""rogue proprietor"".<ref name=""Greenslade"" />  In late 2008, Express Newspapers began cutting 80 jobs to reduce costs by £2.5&nbsp;million; however, too few staff were willing to take voluntary redundancy.  In early 2008, a previous cost-cutting exercise triggered the first 24-hour national press strike in the UK for 18 years. In late August 2009 came plans for a further 70 redundancies, affecting journalists across Express Newspapers  including the ''Daily'' and ''Sunday Express'', the ''Daily Star'', and the ''Daily Star Sunday'' .  In August 2009, the [[Advertising Standards Authority  United Kingdom |Advertising Standards Authority  criticised the company for [[advertorial s as features alongside adverts for the same products. The ASA noted that the pieces were 'always and uniquely favourable to the product featured in the ads and contained claims that have been or were likely to be prohibited in advertisements'  In January 2010, the ''Daily Express'' was censured by the Advertising Standards Authority over a front-page promotion for ""free"" fireworks. This led to comment that the ''Express'' has become ""the Ryanair of Fleet Street"", in that it is a ""frequent offender"" which pays little heed to the ASA's criticisms.  In May 2010, Desmond announced a commitment of £100&nbsp;million over five years to buy new equipment for the printing plants, beginning with the immediate purchase of four new presses, amid industry rumours that he was going to establish a printing plant at Luton.  On 31 December 2010, the Express, with all the media titles in Desmond's [[Northern & Shell  group, were excluded from the [[Press Complaints Commission  after withholding payment. [[Guy Black, Baron Black of Brentwood|Lord Black , chairman of [[Press Standards Board of Finance|PressBof , the PCC's parent organisation, called this ""a deeply regrettable decision"".  According to ''Press Gazette'', in December 2016 circulation figures showed gross sales of the ''[[Daily Mail '' were 1,491,264 compared to 391,626 for the ''Daily Express''.<ref name=""circ""/>  The full run of the ''Daily Express'' has been digitised and is available at UK Press Online.  In September 2017, ''[[Daily Mirror '' publisher [[Trinity Mirror  announced its interest in buying all of Express Newspapers from Desmond. The ''[[Financial Times '' called it potentially the biggest change in the British newspaper industry for a decade.  ==''Sunday Express''== <!-- [[Daily Mirror  links here -->  [[File:SundayEx.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Front page of the ''Sunday Express'', 7 May 2011   The printing press of the ''Sunday Express'' was first started by [[Lady Diana Cooper|Lady Diana Manners  on 29 December 1918. It is edited by Michael Booker. Its circulation in February 2019 was 272,259.<ref name=""circ""/>  ==Controversies==  ===John Bodkin Adams=== Suspected [[serial killer  [[John Bodkin Adams|Dr John Bodkin Adams  was arrested in 1956, accused of murdering up to 400 wealthy patients in [[Eastbourne , England.<ref name=Cullen></ref> The press, ""egged on by police leaks, unanimously declared Adams guilty,"" except for [[Percy Hoskins , chief crime reporter for the ''Express''.<ref name=Hoskins>''Two Men Were Acquitted: The trial and acquittal of Doctor John Bodkin Adams'', Secker & Warburg, 1984</ref> Hoskins was adamant that Adams was a naive doctor prosecuted by an overzealous detective, [[Herbert Hannam , whom Hoskins disliked from previous cases.<ref name=Hoskins/> The ''Express'', under Hoskins' direction, was the only major paper to defend Adams, causing [[Lord Beaverbrook  to question Hoskins's stance.<ref name=Hoskins/>   Adams was cleared in 1957 of the murder of [[Edith Alice Morrell   a second count was withdrawn controversially . After the case, Beaverbrook phoned Hoskins and said: ""Two people were acquitted today"", meaning Hoskins as well.<ref name=Hoskins/> The ''Express'' carried an exclusive interview with Adams, whom Hoskins interviewed in a safe house away from other newspapers. According to archives released in 2003, Adams was thought by police to have killed 163 patients.<ref name=Cullen/>  ===Dunblane===   On 8 March 2009, the Scottish edition of the ''Sunday Express'' published a front-page article critical of survivors of the 1996 [[Dunblane massacre , entitled ""Anniversary Shame of Dunblane Survivors"". The article criticised the 18-year-old survivors for posting ""shocking blogs and photographs of themselves on the internet"", revealing that they drank alcohol, made rude gestures and talked about their sex lives.  The article provoked complaints, leading to a front-page apology a [[fortnight  later,. The [[Press Complaints Commission  described the article as a ""serious error of judgement"" and said, ""Although the editor had taken steps to resolve the complaint, and rightly published an apology, the breach of the Code was so serious that no apology could remedy it"".  ===Diana, Princess of Wales=== The ''Daily Express'' had a reputation for printing [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales  as front-page news, earning it the nickname the ''Daily Ex-Princess''; this has been satirised in ''[[Private Eye '' as the ''Diana Express'' or the ''Di'ly Express'', and has been attributed to Desmond's friendship with regular ''Eye'' target [[Mohamed Al Fayed|Mohamed Fayed .<ref group=note> For instance in the ""Hackwatch"" column of ''Private Eye'' #1174, 19 December 2006.</ref> In 2006 and 2007, these front-page stories consistently appeared on Mondays, and ended only when the paper focused instead on the [[Madeleine McCann  story  see below .   Even on 7 July 2006, the anniversary of the [[7/7|London bombings   used by most other newspapers to publish commemorations  the front page was given over to Diana. This tendency was also mocked on ''[[Have I Got News for You '' when on 6 November 2006, the day other papers reported the death sentence given to [[Saddam Hussein  on their front pages, the ''Express'' led with ""SPIES COVER UP DIANA 'MURDER'"".  According to ''[[The Independent '' ""The Diana stories appear on Mondays because Sunday is often a quiet day.""<ref name=""Independent Hill""></ref> In February and March 2010 the paper returned to featuring Diana stories on the front page on Mondays.  In September 2013, following an allegation raised by the estranged wife of an [[Special Air Service|SAS  operative, the ''Daily Express'' returned to running daily Princess Diana cover stories.  ===Madeleine McCann=== In the second half of 2007 the ''Daily Express'' gave a large coverage to the [[disappearance of Madeleine McCann . From 3 August 2007 to 10 November 2007, the ''Express'' dedicated at least part of the next 100 front pages to her. Of those, 82 used the headline to feature the details of the disappearance  often stylised by ""MADELEINE"" in red block capitals, plus a picture of the child .  Though the family initially said some journalists may have ""overstepped their mark"" they acknowledged the benefits in keeping the case in the public eye, but said coverage needed to be toned down since daily headlines were not necessarily helpful. In March 2008, the McCanns launched a [[libel  suit against the ''Daily Express'' and the ''[[Daily Star  United Kingdom |Daily Star '', as well as their Sunday equivalents, following their coverage. The action concerned more than 100 stories across the four newspapers, which accused the McCanns of causing and covering up their daughter's death.<ref name=""Damages due""/> Express Newspapers pulled all references to Madeleine from its websites.  In a settlement at the [[High Court of Justice , the newspapers ran a front-page apology to the McCanns on 19 March 2008, another apology on the front of the Sunday editions of 23 March and a statement of apology at the High Court. The newspapers also agreed to pay costs and damages, which the McCanns said they would use to fund the search for their daughter.<ref name=""Damages due""></ref> ''Guardian'' media commentator [[Roy Greenslade  said it was ""unprecedented"" for four major newspapers to offer front-page apologies but also said it was more than warranted given that the papers had committed ""a substantial libel"" that shamed the British press. [[Craig Silverman  of ''Regret the Error'',  a blog that reports media errors, argued that given how many of the stories appeared on the front page, anything less than a front-page apology would have been ""unacceptable.""  In its apology, the ''Express'' said ""a number of articles in the newspaper have suggested that the couple caused the death of their missing daughter Madeleine and then covered it up. We acknowledge that there is no evidence whatsoever to support this theory and that Kate and Gerry are completely innocent of any involvement in their daughter's disappearance."" This was followed in October by an apology and payout  forwarded to the fund again  to a group who had become known as the ""[[Tapas Seven "" in relation to the case.  ===Accusations of xenophobia and hate speech === In 2013, the paper launched a 'crusade' against new [[European Union  rules of migrants from Bulgaria and Romania. The front page on Thursday 31 October declared 'Britain is full and fed up. Today join your Daily Express Crusade to stop new flood of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants'. The [[Aberystwyth University  Student Union announced a ban on the sale of the paper. However, this ban was overturned in March 2016, following student campaigning in opposition to it. [[UKIP  leader [[Nigel Farage  declared that he had signed the petition, and urged other to do the same. Romanian politician [[Cătălin Ivan  expressed 'outrage' at the campaign. 150,000 people signed the petition.  In a statement released by The [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights   OHCHR  on 24 April 2015, the tabloid's name was mentioned in an accusation of producing [[hate speech , initially referring to an article in [[The Sun  United Kingdom |''The Sun'' : ""...To give just one glimpse of the scale of the problem, back in 2003 the ''Daily Express'' ran 22 negative front pages stories about asylum seekers and refugees in a single 31-day period"", same report from OHCHR very strong statement, ""..the High Commissioner noted that Article 20 of the ICCPR, as well as elements relating to hate speech in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination*  both of which have been ratified by the U.K., as well as by all other EU countries , were rooted in the desire to outlaw the type of anti-Semitic and other racially based hate speech used by the Nazi media during the 1930s"".   Appearing in April 2018 before a home affairs select committee that is investigating the treatment of minority groups in print media, ''Daily Express'' editor Gary Jones said that he would be looking to change the tone of the paper. Jones said that he had found past pages of the newspaper “downright offensive,” adding that they made him feel “very uncomfortable” and contributed to an “Islamophobic sentiment” in the media.   ==Editors==  ===''Daily Express''=== * [[Sir Arthur Pearson, 1st Baronet|Arthur Pearson   April 1900 – 1901  * [[Bertram Fletcher Robinson   July 1900 – May 1904  * [[R.

Later, under president Frank J. Walton, the Heritage Foundation began using [[direct mail fundraising  and Heritage's annual income grew to $1 million per year in 1976.<ref name=TPOI-1></ref> By 1981, the annual budget grew to $5.3 million.<ref name="":2"" />  Heritage advocated for pro-business policies, [[anti-communism  and [[neoconservatism  in its early years, but distinguished itself from the conservative [[American Enterprise Institute|American Enterprise Institute  AEI   by also advocating for Christian conservatism.<ref name="":2"" /> Through the 1970s, Heritage would remain small relative to Brookings and the AEI.<ref name="":2"" />  ===Reagan administration=== In January 1981 Heritage published the ''[[Mandate for Leadership '', a comprehensive report aimed at reducing the size of the federal government, providing public policy guidance to the incoming [[Reagan administration , including more than 2,000 specific suggestions to move the federal government in a conservative direction. The report was well received by [[the White House , and several of its authors went on to take positions in the [[Reagan administration .<ref name=TPOI-3></ref> Reagan liked the ideas so much that he gave a copy to each member of his cabinet to review.<ref name=""heritage.org""></ref> Approximately 60% of the 2,000 proposals were implemented or initiated by the end of Reagan's first year in office.<ref name=TPOI-3/><ref name=Holwill></ref> [[Ronald Reagan  later on said that the Heritage Foundation played a ""vital force"" in the successes during his presidency.<ref name=""heritage.org""/>  Heritage was influential in developing and advancing of the so-called ""[[Reagan Doctrine ,"" a Reagan administration foreign policy initiative in which the U.S. provided military and other support to [[anti-communism|anti-communist  resistance movements fighting [[Soviet Union|Soviet -aligned governments in [[Afghanistan , [[Angola , [[Cambodia , [[Nicaragua  and other nations during the final years of the [[Cold War .  Heritage also [[advocacy|advocated  the development of new [[ballistic missile  defense systems for the United States. Reagan adopted this as his top defense priority in 1983, calling it the [[Strategic Defense Initiative .<ref name=TPOI-3/> By mid-decade, The Heritage Foundation had emerged as a key organization in the national conservative movement, publishing influential reports on domestic and defense issues, as well as pieces by prominent conservative figures, such as [[Bob Dole  and [[Pat Robertson .<ref name=TPOI-4></ref> In 1986, ''[[Time  magazine |Time '' called Heritage ""the foremost of the new breed of advocacy tanks"".<ref name=Time></ref> During the Reagan and Bush administrations, The Heritage Foundation served as the President's brain trust on foreign policy.  ===George H. W. Bush administration=== The Heritage Foundation remained an influential voice on domestic and foreign policy issues during President [[George H. W. Bush 's administration. It was a leading proponent of [[Operation Desert Storm  against [[Iraq , and – according to Frank Starr, head of the ''[[Baltimore Sun ''s Washington bureau – the foundation's studies ""laid much of the groundwork for Bush administration thinking"" about post-Soviet foreign policy.<ref name=Starr></ref> In domestic policy, the Bush administration agreed with six of the ten budget reforms contained in ''Mandate for Leadership III'' and included them in their 1990 budget proposal. Heritage also became involved in the [[culture war s of the 1990s with the publication of ""The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators"" by [[William Bennett . The Index documented how crime, illegitimacy, divorce, teenage suicide, drug use and fourteen other social indicators had become measurably worse since the 1960s.<ref name=TPOI-5></ref>  ===Clinton administration=== Heritage continued to grow throughout the 1990s and its journal, ''[[Policy Review '', hit an all-time-high circulation of 23,000. Heritage was an opponent of the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993 . President Clinton's welfare reforms were analogous with Heritage's recommendations and were adopted in the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act  of 1996. In 1995, Heritage published the first [[Index of Economic Freedom , co-authored by policy analyst Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy. In 1997, the Index became a joint project between the Heritage Foundation and the ''[[Wall Street Journal ''.<ref name=TPOI-5 />  In 1994, Heritage advised [[Newt Gingrich  and other conservatives on the development of the ""[[Contract with America "", which was credited with helping to produce a Republican majority in [[United States Congress|Congress . The ""Contract"" was a pact of principles that directly challenged both the political status-quo in Washington and many of the ideas at the heart of the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton administration .  ===George W. Bush administration=== In 2005, ''[[The Washington Post '' criticized the Heritage Foundation for softening its criticism of [[Malaysia  following a business relationship between Heritage's president and Malaysia's then-prime minister [[Mahathir Mohamad . The Heritage Foundation denied any conflict of interest, stating its views on Malaysia changed following the country's cooperation with the U.S. after the [[September 11 attacks  in 2001, and changes by Malaysia ""moving in the right economic and political direction.""   ===Obama administration=== In December 2012, an announcement was made that Senator [[Jim DeMint  would resign from the Senate to head the Heritage Foundation. Pundits predicted his tenure would bring a sharper, more politicized edge to the Foundation. DeMint's eventual ouster in 2017 led some, such as Mickey Edwards  R-Okla. , to believe Heritage sought to pare back its partisan edge and restore its reputation as a pioneering think tank.  On May 10, 2013, [[Jason Richwine , who co-authored the think tank's controversial report on the costs of [[amnesty , resigned his position following intensive media attention on his [[Harvard  PhD thesis from 2009 and comments he made at a 2008 [[American Enterprise Institute  forum. Richwine argued that Hispanics and blacks are [[Race and intelligence|intellectually inferior  to whites and have trouble assimilating because of a supposed genetic predisposition to lower [[Intelligence quotient|IQ .  A 2011 study on [[poverty in America  was criticized for what critics called an overly narrow definition of poverty. Criticism was published in opinion editorials in ''[[The New Republic '', ''[[The Nation '', the [[Center for American Progress , and ''[[The Washington Post ''.  A 2013 study by Heritage senior fellow [[Robert Rector  on the 2013 Senate Immigration Bill  [[Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013   was criticized for its methodology by critics from across the political spectrum. Notably, outlets like ''[[Reason Magazine '' and the [[Cato Institute  criticized the report for failing to employ [[dynamic scoring  despite Heritage's support for such methodology in analyzing other policy proposals. The study was also criticized because its co-author, Jason Richwine, said in his 2009 doctoral dissertation that immigrants' IQ's should be considered when crafting public policy.  In July 2013, following disputes over the [[United States farm bill|farm bill , the [[Republican Study Committee  of 172 conservative U.S. House members reversed a decades-old tradition of access by barring Heritage Foundation employees from attending its weekly meeting in the Capitol, but continues cooperation through ""regular joint events and briefings"".  In September 2015, the Foundation stated publicly that it had been targeted by [[Hacker  computer security |hackers  and had experienced a breach in which donors' information was taken. ''[[The Hill  publication |The Hill '' publication compared the attack to [[Office of Personnel Management data breach|another notable data breach  at the [[Office of Personnel Management  a few months before. The identity of those that attacked the Foundation and their motivations are unknown.  ===Trump administration=== The Heritage Foundation has been described as a major influence on the [[presidential transition of Donald Trump  and the Trump administration.<ref name="":0""></ref><ref name="":1""></ref> The foundation had a powerful say in the staffing of the administration, with ''CNN'' noting during the transition that ""no other Washington institution has that kind of footprint in the transition.""<ref name="":0"" /> One reason for the Heritage Foundation's disproportionate influence relative to other conservative think tanks is that other conservative think tanks had members who identified as ""never-Trumpers"" during the 2016 election whereas the Heritage Foundation signaled early on to Trump that it would be supportive of him.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":1"" />  In 2014, the Heritage Foundation began building a database of approximately 3,000 conservatives who they trusted to serve in a hypothetical Republican administration for the upcoming 2016 election.<ref name="":1"" /> According to individuals involved in crafting the database, several hundred people from the Heritage database ultimately received jobs in the Trump administration.<ref name="":1"" /> At least 66 foundation employees and alumni got positions in the administration.<ref name="":1"" /> The foundation also recommended cabinet members [[Scott Pruitt , [[Betsy DeVos , [[Mick Mulvaney , [[Rick Perry , and [[Jeff Sessions .<ref name="":1"" /> Heritage head Jim DeMint personally intervened on behalf of Mulvaney, who would go on to head the [[Office of Management and Budget  and the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau .<ref name="":1"" />  ==Policy influence== [[File:US Navy 100513-N-8273J-010 Chief of Naval Operations  CNO  Adm. Gary Roughead speaks at the Heritage Foundation.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Chief of Naval Operations   CNO  Admiral [[Gary Roughead  speaks at The Heritage Foundation.  The Heritage Foundation has regularly ranked as one of the world's most influential think tanks. The ''2016 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report'' published by the [[Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program  at the [[University of Pennsylvania  ranks Heritage 12th among ""Top Think Tanks Worldwide"" and seventh among ""Top Think Tanks in the United States"". Additionally, the program ranks Heritage 25th in the world in ""Defense and National Security"", ""sixth in the world in ""Domestic Economic Policy"", 14th in the world in ""Education Policy"", 24th in the world in ""Foreign Policy and International Affairs"", tenth in the world ""Domestic Health Policy"", 30th in the world in ""International Economic Policy"", tenth in the world in ""Social Policy"", 12th in the world in ""Transparency and Good Governance"", first in the world in ""Best Advocacy Campaign"", 13th in the world in ""Best Managed Think Tanks"", seventh in the world in ""Best New Idea or Paradigm Developed"", 18th in the world in ""Best Think Tank Network"", fifth in the world in ""Best Use of Social Networks"", ninth in the world in ""Think Tanks to Watch in 2017"", fifth in the world in ""Best External Relations/Public Engagement Programs"", third in the world in ""Best Use of the Internet"", seventh in the world in ""Best Use of Media"", tenth in the world in ""Most Innovative Policy Ideas/Proposals"", eighth in the world in ""Most Significant Impact on Public Policy"", and 17th in the world in ""Outstanding Policy-Oriented Public Programs"".  Heritage has hosted many influential foreign and domestic political leaders since its founding, including members of [[United States Congress|Congress , foreign heads of state, and U.S. presidents. On November 1, 2007, President George W. Bush visited Heritage to defend his appointment of [[Michael Mukasey  to succeed [[Alberto Gonzales  as [[Attorney General of the United States ; Mukasey's nomination faced opposition in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate  over the nominee's refusal to label the interrogation tactic of [[waterboarding  as illegal. Mukasey was confirmed and became Attorney General eight days later.  The [[health insurance mandate  in the 2010 [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , also known as [[Obamacare , is an idea hatched in 1989 by [[Stuart Butler  at Heritage in a publication titled ""Assuring Affordable Health Care for All Americans"".  This was also the model for [[Mitt Romney 's health care plan in Massachusetts.  In October 2011, The Heritage Foundation and the [[American Enterprise Institute   AEI  announced they would co-host the [[Republican Party  United States  presidential debates, 2012|Republican Party presidential candidates' debate  on foreign policy and national defense. The event took place at [[DAR Constitution Hall|Constitution Hall  on November 22, 2011, and was the first presidential debate to be sponsored by either Heritage or AEI.<ref name=""heritage1""></ref><ref name=""dailycaller1""></ref>  Several Heritage Foundation personnel have served, or gone on to serve, in senior governmental roles, including: [[Richard V. Allen , [[Paul Bremer , [[Elaine Chao , [[Lawrence Di Rita , [[Michael Johns  policy analyst |Michael Johns , [[John Lehman , and [[Edwin Meese .<ref name=personnel></ref>  ==Publications and activities== Heritage's 1981 book of policy analysis, ''[[Mandate for Leadership '', was a landmark in advocacy for limited government. At 1,000-plus pages, ''Mandate for Leadership'' offered specific recommendations on policy, budget and administrative action for all Cabinet departments.  Until 2001, the Heritage Foundation published ''[[Policy Review '', a public policy journal, which was then acquired by the [[Hoover Institution . From 1995 to 2005, the Heritage Foundation ran [[Townhall.com , a conservative website that was subsequently acquired by [[Camarillo, California -based [[Salem Communications . In 2005, the Foundation published ''The Heritage Guide to the Constitution'', a clause-by-clause analysis of the [[United States Constitution .  Once per year Heritage publishes its ''Budget Chart Book'' using visual graphs and charts to demonstrate the growth of federal spending, revenue, debt and deficits, and entitlement programs. The chart relies on 42 visual images to convey its data, which Heritage makes available to the public for free distribution.  Policy analysts and fellows of the Heritage Foundation frequently publish books, both through Heritage and other non-fiction imprints. Among independent publications, in 2010 the [[Intercollegiate Studies Institute  published ''[[We Still Hold These Truths '' by director of American Studies Matthew Spalding.<ref name=Coyne></ref>  Under Jim DeMint's leadership, the process involved in publishing policy papers changed at the Heritage Foundation.<ref name="":1"" /> Whereas previous senior staff reviewed policy papers by staff, DeMint and his team heavily edited policy papers or shelved them.<ref name="":1"" /> In response to this, several scholars at the foundation quit.<ref name="":1"" />  === Indices === Internationally, and in partnership with the ''[[Wall Street Journal '', Heritage publishes the annual ''[[Index of Economic Freedom '', which measures a country's freedom in terms of property rights and freedom from government regulation. The factors used to calculate the ''Index'' score are corruption in government, barriers to [[international trade , [[income tax  and corporate tax rates, government expenditures, [[rule of law  and the ability to enforce contracts, regulatory burdens, banking restrictions, [[labor movement|labor  regulations, and [[black market  activities. Deficiencies lower the score on Heritage's ''Index''. The Heritage Foundation also publishes ''The Insider'', a quarterly magazine about public policy.  Charles W. L. Hill, after discussing the international shift toward a market-based economic system and Heritage Foundation's ''Index of Economic Freedom'', said ""given that the Heritage Foundation has a political agenda, its work should be viewed with caution.""<ref name=intbusn-mcgrawhill-polagen></ref>  In 2002, Heritage began publishing its annual Index of Dependence report on the growth of federal government programs that constrain private sector or local government alternatives and impact the dependence of individuals on the federal government. It examines programs in five broad categories: housing; health care and welfare; retirement; higher education; and rural and agricultural services.<ref name=Hogberg></ref> The report has found that each year the number of Americans who pay nothing in federal personal income taxes continues to increase, while there is a simultaneous increase in the number who rely on government services. The 2010 report found that Americans' dependence on government grew by 13.6% in 2009 during the worst U.S. economic crisis since the [[Great Depression . According to Heritage, this is the biggest increase since 1976 and the fifth largest going back to 1962, when the foundation began tracking dependence.<ref name=Hogberg/> The report stated that in the previous eight years, the index of government dependence has grown by almost 33 percent.  ===Digital communications=== Until 2014, the Heritage Foundation published a blog, ''The Foundry'', with reporting provided by Heritage staff and fellows. News stories originally published by The Foundry have been reported by media outlets,<ref name=Bila></ref> including reporting on a 15-cent Christmas Tree tax proposed by the Obama administration. Following a Heritage blog post by [[David Addington  that was critical of the tax, the story was reported by [[ABC News , and according to [[Fox News , this criticism in the media led to a delay in the implementation of the tax.  In 2014, ''The Foundry'' was phased out and replaced with ''[[The Daily Signal '', the Heritage Foundation's multimedia news organization.<ref name=Chasmar></ref><ref name=Byers></ref>  Since 2006, the Foundation has hosted ""The Bloggers Briefing"", a meeting of conservative and independent bloggers organized by [[Robert Bluey .<ref name=Owens></ref> According to Bluey, the meetings were launched to provide conservative bloggers with greater understanding of conservative policy debates and a forum to discuss ideas, as there was then no regular meeting of people involved in the conservative blogosphere.<ref name=Owens/> Guest speakers at the meetings have included [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.|Jon Huntsman , [[John Boehner  and [[Robert Novak , and the briefings are video recorded and live streamed on the Internet.<ref name=Owens/>  In June 2011, Heritage launched ""Scribe"", an investigative journalism feature by Robert Bluey for its blog, The Foundry. At the time of its launch, Bluey stated that Scribe would feature ""long-form investigative stories"" focusing on important policy issues, video report, analysis and breaking news. Scribe is part of a trend of ""think tank journalism"" using the knowledge of Heritage policy experts to inform investigative stories.  According to The Next Web, the Foundation ""has strong followings on most major platforms – from [[YouTube  to [[Twitter  to [[Facebook "".<ref name=Owens/> Rory Cooper, the Foundation's communications director, stated that the organization uses social media platforms such as Facebook for issue-based campaigns to provide individuals and the media with information directly from the Foundation.<ref name=Owens/>  ===Other media=== In 2009, Heritage produced ''33 Minutes'', a one-hour documentary film about the foreign policy challenges facing the United States, titled after the time required for a [[intercontinental ballistic missile|long-range nuclear ballistic missile  to be fired from any distant hostile nation and deliver its payload to any American city. The film interviews numerous foreign policy experts, including former Assistant Secretary of State [[Kim Holmes , professor and journalist [[James Carafano , weapons scientist [[Ken Alibek , former [[White House Chief of Staff  [[Edwin Meese , and former [[British Prime Minister  [[Margaret Thatcher . The Heritage Foundation has hosted viewings of this film, followed by panel discussions.  The foundation sponsors the radio show ''Istook Live!'', which is hosted by former congressman [[Ernest Istook  and a production of Heritage's sister organization, [[Heritage Action for America .  ===Republican presidential debate=== On November 22, 2011, The Heritage Foundation and the [[American Enterprise Institute  co-hosted the [[Republican Party  United States  presidential debates, 2012|Republican Party presidential candidates' debate  on foreign policy and national defense held at [[DAR Constitution Hall|Constitution Hall . The event was the first presidential debate to be sponsored by either Heritage or AEI.<ref name=""heritage1""/><ref name=""dailycaller1""/> During the debate, Heritage fellows [[Edwin Meese  and [[David Addington  were among those who questioned candidates on policy.<ref name=Rutenberg/> The debate was praised by ''[[The New York Times '' for putting ""pressure on candidates to show their policy expertise"".<ref name=Rutenberg></ref> According to conservative commentator [[Michael Barone  pundit |Michael Barone , the debate was ""probably the most substantive and serious presidential debate of this election cycle.""  ===Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom=== In 2005, Heritage established the [[Margaret Thatcher  Center for Freedom in honor of the former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister , sponsoring hundreds of events involving world leaders since its inception. Thatcher herself maintained a long relationship with The Heritage Foundation. Shortly after leaving office, Thatcher was honored by Heritage at a  September 1991 dinner. Seven years later, Thatcher delivered the keynote address during Heritage's 25th anniversary celebration. ''Weekly Standard'' Editor [[William Kristol  said at the time, ""Given that Reagan obviously couldn't be here, I think it was important to have Mrs. Thatcher because she and Reagan are really the great heroes of conservatism in the last few decades and still today."" In 2002, Thatcher was again honored by Heritage as the recipient of its annual [[Clare Boothe Luce Award , which was presented by then-Vice President [[Dick Cheney . Thatcher was later named Patron of the Heritage Foundation, her only official association with any U.S.-based group.  ===Associations=== The Heritage Foundation is an associate member of the [[State Policy Network .<ref name=politico></ref>  ==Funding== In 1973, businessman [[Joseph Coors  contributed $250,000 to establish The Heritage Foundation and continued to fund it through the [[Adolph Coors Foundation .<ref name=Miller></ref> In 1973, it had trustees from [[Chase Manhattan Bank , [[Dow Chemical , [[General Motors , [[Pfizer , [[Sears  and [[Mobil .  Heritage is a tax-exempt [[501 c  3   organization as well as a [[BBB Wise Giving Alliance  accredited charity funded by donations from private individuals, corporations and charitable foundations.<ref name=Barro></ref><ref name=HeritageAbout></ref> As a [[501 c  3  , Heritage is not required to disclose its donors and donations to the foundation are tax-deductible.<ref name=Barro/> According to a [[MediaTransparency  report in 2006, donors have included [[John M. Olin Foundation , the [[Castle Rock Foundation , the [[Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation  and the [[Bradley Foundation .<ref name=Berkowitz></ref> Other financing as of 2016 includes $28,129,000 from the combined [[Scaife Foundations  of the late billionaire [[Richard Mellon Scaife . Heritage is a grantee of the [[Donors Trust , a nonprofit [[donor-advised fund .<ref name=MotherJones20130205></ref><ref name=MotherJones20130211></ref><ref name=nbc></ref> As of 2010, Heritage reported 710,000 supporters.<ref name=Kreutzer></ref>  For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011, [[Charity Watch  reported that [[Edwin Feulner , past president of The Heritage Foundation, received the highest compensation in its top 25 list of compensation received by charity members. According to [[Charity Watch , Feulner received $2,702,687 in 2013. This sum includes investment earnings of $1,656,230 accrued over a period of 33 years.  Heritage's total revenue for 2011 was $72,170,983 and its expenses were $80,033,828.<ref name=""charitynavigator1""></ref><ref name=""WSJ""></ref>  ==In popular culture== The Heritage Foundation was mentioned periodically in the [[NBC  fictional television series ''[[The West Wing ''.  The character Patricia Calhoun, a former member of the [[Office of Management and Budget  and a [[Republican Party  United States |Republican  appointee to the [[Federal Election Commission  in the fictional [[Josiah Bartlet|Bartlet  administration, is identified as the former Director of the Roe Institute for Economic Policy at The Heritage Foundation.  Calhoun is depicted in the series as an aggressive advocate of [[campaign finance reform . This is not a focus of the modern Foundation which has endorsed controversial [[Citizens United  effectively removing such controls.  ==Notable Board of Trustees members== * [[Thomas A.

229,Y,phnompenhpost.com,"  | free =  | dirinteractive =  | publishing_country =  | publishing_city =     '''''The Phnom Penh Post'''''    is a daily [[English language|English-language  newspaper published in [[Phnom Penh , [[Cambodia . Founded in 1992 by publisher [[Michael Hayes  publisher |Michael Hayes  and [[Kathleen O'Keefe , it is Cambodia's oldest English-language newspaper. The paper was initially published fortnightly as a full-color [[Tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid ; in 2008 it increased frequency to daily publication and redesigned the format as a [[Berliner  format |Berliner . ''The Phnom Penh Post'' is also available in Khmer language. It previously published a weekend magazine, 7Days, in its Friday edition. Since July 2014, it has published a weekly edition on Saturdays called ''Post Weekend''. ''Post Weekend'' was folded into the paper as a Friday supplement in 2017 and was discontinued in 2018.   It has a staff of Cambodian and foreign journalists covering national news. The newspaper includes specific business, lifestyle and sports sections, and also prints a ""Police Blotter"", which has items related to crime translated from local [[Khmer language|Khmer-language  dailies.  Since its founding in Phnom Penh in July 1992, the printed edition was formerly published on a fortnightly basis, and read in Cambodia and worldwide by over 20,000 people in more than 40 countries.  In early 2008, the newspaper received investment from some Australians and became a daily publication on August 8, 2008.  The Post's news and analysis provide regular and thorough coverage of current issues in a rapidly changing Cambodia. Significant events covered range from the implementation of the UN-sponsored [[1991 Paris Peace Accords  and subsequent elections, to the promulgation of a new constitution enabling the establishment of a constitutional monarchy.

Founded in 1992 by publisher Michael Hayes and Kathleen O'Keefe, it is Cambodia's oldest English-language newspaper. The paper was initially published fortnightly as a full-color tabloid; in 2008 it increased frequency to daily publication and redesigned the format as a Berliner. The Phnom Penh Post is also available in Khmer language. It previously published a weekend magazine, 7Days, in its Friday edition. Since July 2014, it has published a weekly edition on Saturdays called Post Weekend. Post Weekend was folded into the paper as a Friday supplement in 2017 and was discontinued in 2018.  It has a staff of Cambodian and foreign journalists covering national news. The newspaper includes specific business, lifestyle and sports sections, and also prints a ""Police Blotter"", which has items related to crime translated from local Khmer-language dailies. Since its founding in Phnom Penh in July 1992, the printed edition was formerly published on a fortnightly basis, and read in Cambodia and worldwide by over 20,000 people in more than 40 countries.  In early 2008, the newspaper received investment from some Australians and became a daily publication on August 8, 2008. The Post's news and analysis provide regular and thorough coverage of current issues in a rapidly changing Cambodia. Significant events covered range from the implementation of the UN-sponsored 1991 Paris Peace Accords and subsequent elections, to the promulgation of a new constitution enabling the establishment of a constitutional monarchy.

248,Y,truth-out.org," | alexa =  48,118   <ref name=""alexa""></ref> <!-- Updated monthly by LkolblyBot -->    '''Truthout''' is a [[nonprofit  news organization which aims to provide independent reporting and commentary on a diverse range of social justice issues. Since they were founded in 2001, they have anchored their work in principles of accuracy, transparency, and independence from corporate influence and partisan forces.  Truthout describes itself as a type of journalism in pursuit of justice. Truthout is dependent on its readers and donations from foundations who support their work. Donations from individual readers have accounted for an average 81% of their annual budget over a five year period. Some of Truthout's main areas of focus are mass incarceration, social justice and climate change.  Truthout's editorial team is led by editor in chief [[Maya Schenwar , and managing director Ziggy West Jeffery.  ==Coverage examples== Truthout has published several pieces which have impacted local and national policy.  === Illegal Navy Training === In 2016, [[Dahr Jamail  and Truthout released [[Navy  documents outlining plans for combat training exercises along vast non-military areas of [[Washington  state |Washington State  coastline. The documents showed the areas the Navy was prepared to utilize, without the mandatory risk assessments, medical plans, surveys of training areas and coordinating their activities with local, state and federal law enforcement officials. The release of these documents forced the Navy to postpone this training for at least 2 years. It caused commotion within the Washington state government, as they weren’t aware of the Navy's plans.  === Offshore Fracking === In 2013, Truthout journalist Mike Ludwig unearthed with a [[Freedom of Information Act  United States |Freedom of Information Act  request with the [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department  revealed that [[fracking  technology was being used on offshore oil rigs in the ecologically sensitive [[Santa Barbara Channel . Coastal conservationists were alarmed, and environmental groups sprang into action, generating protests and broad public discussion about offshore fracking. At one point, lawsuits filed by environmental groups forced federal officials to place a moratorium on offshore fracking in the Channel while regulators reviewed the practice and their rules for making it safe. In 2014, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA  issued a new rules requiring offshore drillers to disclose fracking chemicals they dump into the ocean off the California coast. &nbsp;  === Fracking in the Gulf of Mexico === In 2016, a Truthout investigation revealed commonplace fracking in the [[Gulf of Mexico , where offshore oil and gas drillers used fracking technology to maximize oil and gas production in aging undersea wells. A story broken by journalist Mike Ludwig revealed that the [[Barack Obama|Obama  administration had rubber-stamped 1,500 permit modifications to allow fracking in the Gulf of Mexico and had routinely excluded the practice from in-depth environmental reviews—even during the initial days of the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|Deepwater Horizon disaster . That investigation shined a critical light on industry's practice of mixing toxic fracking chemicals with drilling wastewater and dumping it directly into shallow waters of the Gulf. This practice was the subject of further legal challenges from environmental groups.  === Feminine Hygiene in Virginia Prisons === In September 2018, Truthout broke a story that exposed a new policy forbidding visitors to Virginia prisons that are run by the Department of Corrections from using tampons or feminine hygiene cups. The story sparked a public outcry and the policy was quickly suspended.  === The Case of Marissa Alexander === [[Marissa Alexander case|Marissa Alexander  was originally sentenced to 20 years in prison after being found guilty of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon—for firing a warning shot in what many argue was self-defense against her abusive ex-husband. An appeals court overturned her conviction, and Alexander agreed to a plea bargain that included time served for the 1,030 days she had already spent behind bars, another 65 days in jail and two years of house arrest. When her period of electronic ankle monitoring ended, and she was finally truly free, Alexander spoke to Truthout about her experience and her commitment to fight for other criminalized survivors of [[domestic violence . Truthout covered the role that social media and community organizing had in mobilizing for Marissa's case in the United States.  ===Safety Issues at BP=== ''[[60 Minutes '' cited a report published at Truthout as a source for its May 16, 2010 episode about the [[BP oil spill  and the [[whistleblower  who warned about a possible blowout at another BP [[deepwater drilling  site. Digital Journal wrote up the story. [[CNN 's [[Randi Kaye  in an article cited a report by Truthout as the first article on BP Alaska employee Mark Kovac's inside knowledge about the safety concerns at the [[Prudhoe Bay , Alaska BP oil field. On July 14, 2010, the [[United States House of Representatives  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure held a hearing in the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials. The hearing titled ""The Safety of Hazardous Liquid Pipelines  Part 2 : Integrity Management"", cited an investigative report by Truthout as a document for the committee's investigation.  ===Veterans' Issues===  Truthout has closely followed issues affecting Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. Coverage has especially focused on veteran health care and [[post-traumatic stress disorder . An ongoing Truthout investigation has claimed widespread neglect within the [[Veterans Health Administration  of veterans with PTSD.  === Health Care: Defending the ACA, Fighting for Single Payer === Truthout covered repeated efforts to pass “Trumpcare.” They clearly outline that they are not impartial on the matter as they believe it to be an issue which is ""literally a matter of life and death"" for millions of Americans. Truthout has published reporting both on the fine print details of the proposed legislation and the groups who are fighting back.  == Awards ==  === Izzy Award === [[Dahr Jamail  was awarded the 2018 [[Izzy Award  for outstanding achievement in independent media for his reporting on climate change and other environmental issues. The judges wrote: ""There is an urgency and passion in Dahr Jamail’s reporting that is justified by the literally earth-changing subject matter. And it’s supported by science and on-the-scene sources, whether covering ocean pollution, sea level rise, deafening noise pollution or Fukushima radiation.""  Jamail's monthly wrap-ups of the latest climate research and trends – “Climate Disruption Dispatches” – have become an essential resource for scientists and fellow journalists.  === San Francisco Press Club Journalism Awards === A joint Truthout and [[Earth Island Journal  investigation “America's Toxic Prisons” by Candice Bernd, Zoe Loftus-Farren, and Maureen Nandini Mitra won awards in two categories of the 2018 San Francisco Press Club Journalism Awards. The investigation won second place in the Magazines category for environment/nature reporting and investigative reporting.   ==Controversies== [[File:Fbi-section-chief-of-international-terrorism.pdf|thumb|Example: FBI Section Chief of International Terrorism Division's Memo to Immigration About [[Abu Zubaydah    On May 13, 2006, after [[Jason Leopold  posted on Truthout that [[Karl Rove  had been [[Indictment|indicted  by the [[grand jury  investigating the [[Plame affair , Rove spokesman [[Mark Corallo  denied the story, calling it ""a complete fabrication"". Truthout defended the story, saying on May 15 they had two sources ""who were explicit about the information"" published,<ref name=""Jason Leopold Caught Sourceless""></ref> and confirmed on May 25 that they had ""three independent sources confirming that attorneys for Karl Rove were handed an indictment"" on the night of May 12.<ref name=""Jason Leopold Caught Sourceless""/>  The grand jury concluded with no indictment of Rove.<ref name=""salon""></ref>  In his memoir, ''Courage and Consequence'',  Karl Rove addressed the Leopold article.

According to Rove, ""[Special Counsel] [[Patrick Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald  got a kick out of the fictitious account and e-mailed Luskin to see how he felt after such a long day.""  Jason Leopold no longer works at Truthout. He is now a [https://www.buzzfeed.com/jasonaleopold senior investigative reporter] at [[BuzzFeed .  ==Staff== Truthout is led by Editor-in-Chief [[Maya Schenwar , and Managing Director Ziggy West Jeffery.

On August 27, 2009, a member of Truthout's board of directors signed a recognition statement by the organization of [[The Newspaper Guild|The Newspaper Guild/CWA , allowing employed writers for the site to unionize with the Newspaper Guild/CWA as their preferred bargaining representative. The site also held what it called the first-ever ""virtual [[card check "", whereby paid writers faxed [[PDF s of their individual signatures to members of the site's organizing committee  who were based in New York, Sacramento, Los Angeles and Chicago respectively  in order to verify their unionizing authorization cards and establish a bargaining unit of the writers.

The publication’s humor often depends on presenting mundane, everyday events as newsworthy, surreal, or alarming  such as “Rotation of Earth Throws Entire North American Continent into Darkness” . In 1999, comedian [[Bob Odenkirk  praised the publication, stating, ""It's the best comedy writing in the country, and it has been since it started.""<ref name=""ew_19990108""></ref>  ''The Onion'' also runs ''[[The A.V.

''ClickHole'' is a satirical website from ''The Onion'' founded in 2014 that parodies [[clickbait  websites such as ''[[BuzzFeed '' and ''[[Upworthy ''. In 2017 the site briefly became ''PatriotHole'', parodying sites like ''[[Breitbart '' with a far right stance by running articles with an extremist view, though these articles were still fake.

According to former editorial manager, Chet Clem, their food budget was so low when they started the paper that they were down to white bread and onions.

The article was then passed around by White House staffers who were apparently alienated by Kushner's appointment.  ===Controversies=== ====U.S. Presidential Seal dispute==== In September 2005, the assistant counsel to President [[George W.

The letter stated, ""It is inconceivable that anyone would think that, by using the seal, ''The Onion'' intends to 'convey... sponsorship or approval' by the president"",  but then went on to ask that the letter be considered a formal application requesting permission to use the seal.<ref name=""nytimes_20060129"" /><ref name=""nytimes_20051024""></ref><ref name=""huffingtonpost_20100503""></ref>  ====85th Academy Awards controversy==== During the [[85th Academy Awards , a post on ''The Onion''s Twitter account called 9-year-old [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress  nominee [[Quvenzhané Wallis  ""a [[cunt "".

The publication’s humor often depends on presenting mundane, everyday events as newsworthy, surreal, or alarming  such as “Rotation of Earth Throws Entire North American Continent into Darkness” . In 1999, comedian Bob Odenkirk praised the publication, stating, ""It's the best comedy writing in the country, and it has been since it started.""The Onion also runs The A.V. Club and ClickHole.

In 2017 the site briefly became PatriotHole, parodying sites like Breitbart with a far right stance by running articles with an extremist view, though these articles were still fake. After a few days the site returned to its previous state, running PatriotHole as a sub segment as of May 2017."

254,Y,ledevoir.com,"    '''''Le Devoir''''' is a French-language newspaper published in [[Montreal  and distributed in [[Quebec  and throughout Canada. It was founded by journalist, politician, and [[Quebec nationalism|nationalist  [[Henri Bourassa  in 1910.  ''Le Devoir'' is one of few independent large-circulation newspapers in Quebec  and one of the few in Canada  in a market dominated by the [[media conglomerate  [[Quebecor   including ''[[Le Journal de Montréal '' .  Historically ''Le Devoir'' was considered Canada's francophone [[newspaper of record , although in the 21st century it has been challenged for that title by the increased status of competitor ''[[La Presse  Canadian newspaper |La Presse ''.  == History == [[Henri Bourassa , a young and promising [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party  MP from [[Montreal , rose to national prominence in 1899 when he resigned his seat in [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament  in protest at the Liberal government's decision to send troops to support the British in the [[South African War  of 1899–1902.<ref name=""autogenerated1"">[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0000912 Bourassa, Henri<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Bourassa was opposed to all Canadian participation in British wars and would go on to become a key figure in fighting for an independent Canadian foreign policy.  He is considered both a forebear of French Canadian nationalists as well as a Canadian nationalist more generally. He was also an early promoter of the bicultural Anglo-French conception of Canada, and an impassioned advocate for the political and cultural equality of all French Canadians within Confederation, wherever they may reside.<ref name=""autogenerated1"" />  In 1910 he founded ''Le Devoir'' as an outlet for his anti-imperialist [[Ligue nationaliste  and to fight for the rights of French Canadians within Confederation. In its maiden edition, published January 10, 1910, Bourassa explained the name  ""the duty"" in English  and mission of the newspaper thus: ""To ensure the triumph of ideas over appetites, of the public good over partisan interests, there is but one means: awake in the people, and above all in the ruling classes, a sense of public duty in all its forms: religious duty, national duty, civic duty.""  Bourassa headed the newspaper until August 3, 1932, when he was replaced by [[Georges Pelletier . After the death of Pelletier in early 1947, the role of editor-in-chief would pass to [[Gérard Filion , ex-editor of ''La Terre de chez nous,'' under whose reign the paper would publish highly controversial critiques of [[Maurice Duplessis 's government in Quebec by journalists and figures such as [[André Laurendeau . [[Claude Ryan , a [[Quebec federalist ideology|federalist , took the helm in 1964, followed by Jean-Louis Roy in 1980 and Benoit Lauzière in 1986. In 1990 the paper got its first woman editor-in-chief when [[Lise Bissonnette  succeeded Lauzière, firmly establishing the paper's sovereigntist orientation following the federalist years of Ryan and his successors.<ref name=""autogenerated1"" /> She would continue on in her post until 1998, with the current editor-in-chief, Bernard Descôteaux, taking over the following year.  While the paper has in recent times becomes associated with the Quebec nationalist movement, it is important to note that Bourassa himself was in fact opposed to the notion of a separate [[territorial entity  for the majority French-speaking province, believing instead in an Anglo-French conception of Canada in which French-speaking Canadians would see their culture recognized as equal and protected and encouraged from coast to coast. Instances of this view can be found in both his campaign for Franco-Ontarian rights as well as his ardent opposition to controversial priest and historian [[Lionel Groulx  in the 1920s following Groulx's musing on the possibility and desirability of a separate Quebec state.<ref name=""autogenerated1"" /> This said, the history of ''Le Devoir'' would become characterized by varying phases  as well as shades  of French Canadian and later Québécois nationalism, opening its pages in the troubled 1930s to Groulx and his followers, yet seeing a federalist at its helm in 1964 in the form of Claude Ryan, who in 1978 would go on to become leader of the [[federalist  [[Quebec Liberal Party .  Ideologically, ''Le Devoir'' has been a chief voice against military intervention and in favour of [[pacifism  and [[social democracy , opposing conscription in [[World War II   see [[Conscription Crisis of 1944   and endorsing, under federalist Ryan's tenure, the election of [[René Lévesque 's new socialist-inspired [[Parti Québécois  in the [[Quebec general election, 1976|1976 election , despite its platform centred on Québécois nationalism. Once considered a reformist paper, it has recently been associated less with ideas that challenge the status quo of Quebec's economic, political and cultural issues.  == Business == [[File:Croix Grand-Pré 1924.jpg|thumb|Le Devoir trip to Acadia  [[Grand-Pré, Nova Scotia|Grand-Pré  , 1924 Le Devoir began as several other businesses besides the newspaper. These ventures included a general printer and publishing house, a bookstore, and a travel agency. Trips were initially organized to coincide with Catholic congresses around the world, as well as for ""pilgrimages"", allowing Quebecois to visit the French diaspora across North America. Such trips included Acadia  1924, 1927 , Ontario  1925 , and Louisiana  1931 . The purpose of the travel venture was, said Napoleon Lafortune, to ""extend the 'work' of the newspaper to defend the French language and the Catholic faith, but by other means."" The unusual service officially lasted from 1924 to 1947, though it effectively ended at the start of World War II when international civilian travel became very difficult.  ''Le Devoir'' has a relatively low circulation of about 34,000 on weekdays and 58,000 on Saturdays. Its financial situation has often been precarious, and recent years are no exception: in 2002, it had revenues of $14,376,530, with a meager profit of $13,524, while the previous year it had made a small loss.  == Other information == The newspaper's slogan is ''""Fais ce que dois""''  Do what [you] must . ''""Le Devoir""'' means ""the duty"" in French. In 1993, following a redesign by Lucie Lacava, a Montreal-based design consultant, the [[Society for News Design  awarded ''Le Devoir''  Best of Show award for ""Overall Design Excellence"" and in 1994 the same group awarded it its Gold award in the Feature Design category.

The story of the ''Herald'' begins in 1870 with a paper known as the ''Lexington Daily Press''. In 1895, a descendant of that paper  was first published as the ''Morning Herald'', later to be renamed the ''Lexington Herald'' in 1905. Meanwhile, in 1888 a group of Fayette County [[Republican Party  United States |Republicans  began publication of a competing afternoon paper named the ''Kentucky Leader'', which became known as the ''Lexington Leader'' in 1901.<ref name=""HL_COL""></ref>  In 1937, the owner of the ''Leader'', John Stoll, purchased the ''Herald''.<ref name=""HL_COL""/> The papers continued as independent entities for 46 years.  Despite the common ownership, the two papers had different editorial stances; the ''Herald'' was moderately liberal while the ''Leader'' was conservative. The two newspapers published a combined Sunday edition. In 1973, both were purchased by ''Knight Newspapers'', which merged with ''Ridder Publications'' to form [[Knight Ridder  the following year.<ref name=""HL_062706""/> A decade later, in 1983, the ''Herald'' and ''Leader'' merged to form today's ''Lexington Herald-Leader''.<ref name=""MCCO""/>  In 1985, publisher [[Creed Black  allowed reporters to publish a series of articles which exposed widespread corruption within the [[University of Kentucky 's [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Wildcats men's basketball team .<ref name=nytimes></ref> From 1979 to 1991, the paper was edited by [[John Carroll  journalist |John Carroll , who went on to edit ''[[The Baltimore Sun '' and ''[[The Los Angeles Times ''.

The job eliminations were a cumulation of efforts that started in May when the workforce was reduced by 15 positions.<ref name=""HL_071201""/>  On July 4, 2004, the newspaper, in an effort to apologize for failing to cover the [[Civil Rights Movement , published a front-page package of stories and archive photos documenting Lexingtonians involved in the movement.<ref name=""MCCO""/> The stories, written by Linda B. Blackford and Linda Minch, received international attention, including a story on the front page of ''[[The New York Times ''. It also received an annual professional award by the Kentucky chapter of the [[Special Libraries Association .  On June 27, 2006, the [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy Company  purchased [[Knight Ridder  for approximately $4 billion in cash and stock on June 27, 2006. It also assumed  Knight Ridder debt of $2 billion. McClatchy sold 12 Knight Ridder papers, but the ''Herald-Leader'' was one of 20 retained.  ==Office and production plant== The ''Herald-Leader'''s new office and production plant facility was completed in September 1980 at a cost of $23 million. It was a  structure that featured 14 Goss Metro offset presses that had the capacity to produce 600,000 newspapers in a typical week.  The plant is on a  lot at the corner of East Main Street and Midland. The $23 million cost was divided into $7,804,000 for architecture, $750,000 for interiors and $8,500,000 for production equipment and presses.  In June 2016, it was announced that the ''Herald-Leader'' would cease its printing operations in Lexington, passing that role to Louisville-based Gannett Publishing Services. As a result of the move, 25 full-time and 4 part-time employees would be laid-off. It was also announced that the plant would be put up for sale, with the Fayette County property valuation administrator assessing the property at $6.84 million for tax purposes. The first issue of the Louisville-printed ''Herald-Leader'' published on August 1, 2016. The last issue of the Lexington Herald-Leader to be printed in Lexington was printed on July 31, 2016. It marked the end of 229 years of newspaper printing in Lexington.  The Herald-Leader building has been proposed as a new city hall for the [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government .

The ''Journal'' was an organ of the [[Whig Party  United States |Whig Party , founded and edited by [[George D. Prentice , a New Englander who initially came to Kentucky to write a biography of [[Henry Clay . Prentice would edit the ''Journal'' for more than 40 years.  In 1844, another newspaper, the ''Louisville Morning Courier'' was founded in Louisville by [[Walter Newman Haldeman . ''The Louisville Daily Journal'' and the ''Louisville Morning Courier'' were the news leaders in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville  and were politically opposed throughout the [[American Civil War|Civil War ; ''The Journal'' was [[Abolitionism|against slavery  while the ''Courier'' was [[Confederate States of America|pro-Confederacy . The ''Courier'' was suppressed by the Union and had to move to Nashville, but returned to Louisville after the war.  In 1868, an ailing Prentice persuaded the 28-year-old [[Henry Watterson  to come edit for the ''Journal''. During secret negotiations in 1868, ''The Journal'' and the ''Courier'' merged and the first edition of ''The Courier-Journal'' was delivered to Louisvillians on Sunday morning, November 8, 1868.  ===Watterson era=== [[File:Editorial Staff of ""The Courier-Journal"" 1868.jpg|thumb|Editorial staff of ''The Courier-Journal'', 1868.  Henry Watterson, the son of a Tennessee congressman, had written for ''[[Harper's Magazine '' and the ''[[New York Times '' before enlisting in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate  Army. He became nationally known for his work as ''The Courier-Journal'' emerged as the region's leading paper. He supported the Democratic Party and pushed for the industrialization of Kentucky and the South in general, notably through urging the [[Southern Exposition  be held in Louisville. He attracted controversy for attempting to prove that [[Christopher Marlowe  had actually written the works of [[Shakespeare . He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1917 for editorials demanding the United States enter [[World War I .<ref name=""presshist""></ref>  ''The Courier-Journal'' founded a companion afternoon edition of the paper, ''[[The Louisville Times '', in May 1884. In 1896, Watterson and Haldeman opposed Democratic presidential candidate [[William Jennings Bryan  over his support of ""[[Free Silver "" coinage. This unpopular decision upset readers and advertisers, many of whom pulled their support for ''The Courier-Journal''. Kentucky voted for the Republican candidate in 1896, the first time in state history, and local political leaders blamed the Courier. Only the popularity of ''The Louisville Times'', which had no strong editorial reputation, saved the newspaper company from bankruptcy. The ''Courier'' supported Bryan in future elections.<ref name=""presshist"" />  Haldeman had owned the papers until his death in 1902, and by 1917 they were owned by his son, William, and Henry Watterson.  ===Bingham ownership=== [[File:Courier-Journal offices in downtown Louisville.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Courier-Journal'' offices in downtown Louisville, built during the Bingham era   On August 8, 1918, [[Robert Worth Bingham  purchased two-thirds interest in the newspapers and acquired the remaining stock in 1920. The liberal Bingham clashed with longtime editor Watterson, who remained on board, but was in the twilight of his career. Watterson's editorials opposing the [[League of Nations  appeared alongside Bingham's favoring it, and Watterson finally retired on April 2, 1919.<ref name=""presshist"" />    As publisher, Bingham set the tone for his editorial pages, and pushed for improved public education, support of African Americans and the poor of [[Appalachia . In 1933, the newspapers passed to his son, [[Barry Bingham, Sr.  Barry Bingham would continue in his father's footsteps, guiding the editorial page and modernizing the paper by setting up several news bureaus throughout the state, expanding the news staff. During Barry Bingham, Sr.'s tenure, the paper was considered Kentucky's ""Newspaper of Record"" and consistently ranked among the 10 best in the nation.<ref name=""presshist"" />  In 1971, [[Barry Bingham, Jr.  succeeded his father as the newspapers' editor and publisher.  The Binghams were well-liked owners popularly credited with being more concerned with publishing quality journalism than making heavy profits. They also owned the leading local radio and television stations -- [[WHAS-TV , [[WHAS-AM , and [[WAMZ|WAMZ-FM —and [[Standard Gravure , a [[rotogravure  printing company that printed ''The Courier-Journal'' Sunday ''Magazine'' as well as similar magazines for other newspapers.  Barry Bingham Jr. sought to free the papers from conflicts of interests, and through ''The Louisville Times'', experimented with new ideas such as signed editorials. Bingham Jr. also parted with tradition by endorsing several Republican candidates for office.<ref name=""presshist"" />  In 1974, [[Carol Sutton  became managing editor of ''The Courier-Journal'', the first woman appointed to such a post at a major US daily newspaper. Under the leadership of C. Thomas Hardin, director of photography, the combined photography staff of ''The Courier-Journal and Louisville Times'' was awarded the 1976 [[Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography  for its coverage of school desegregation in Louisville.  [[Barry Bingham, Jr.  served as editor and publisher until he resigned in 1986, shortly after his father announced that the newspaper company was for sale, in large measure because of disagreements between Bingham Jr. and his sister [[Sallie Bingham|Sallie .  ===Gannett ownership===  [[File:CJ Dispenser.jpg|thumb|left|200px  In July 1986, [[Gannett|Gannett Company, Inc.  purchased the newspaper company for $300 million and appointed George N. Gill President and Publisher. Gill had been with the newspaper and the Binghams for over two decades, working his way up from reporter to Chief Executive Officer of the Bingham Companies. In 1993, Gill retired and Edward E. Manassah became President and Publisher.  February 1987 saw the last publication of ''[[The Louisville Times '', which like most afternoon papers had experienced declining readership; the news operations of the two papers had previously been consolidated under Gannett.  In 1989, the paper's news staff won the Pulitzer Prize for general local reporting for what the Pulitzer board called ""exemplary initial coverage"" of a [[Carrollton, Kentucky bus collision|collision  that was the nation's worst drunk-driving crash and school-bus accident. In 2005, cartoonist [[Nick Anderson  cartoonist |Nick Anderson  won the paper's 10th Pulitzer, but when he left for the ''[[Houston Chronicle '', the paper did not replace him, instead relying largely on submissions from local cartoonists. One, lawyer Marc Murphy, has become a near-regular and gained respect for his work.  On December 3, 2008, it was announced that ''The Courier-Journal'' would lay off 51 employees, including 17 who voluntarily took buyout offers, as part of a larger cutback by Gannett due to financial losses. Seven months later, the paper announced another 44 layoffs, reducing the workforce to 575 employees.  The newspaper resumed polling on elections, and began videostreaming its editorial-board conferences with major candidates, under Publisher Arnold ""Arnie"" Garson, who came from the Argus Leader, Gannett's paper in Sioux Falls, S.D., in late 2008. Garson is an outspoken promoter of the future of printed newspapers in the digital age. Under him, the paper began keeping occasional major stories or sports columns off its website and promoting them as print exclusives. Most of these have run on Sundays; in July 2009, Garson announced that the paper's Sunday home-delivery circulation was up 0.5 percent over the previous year.  ==Awards==  ===Pulitzer Prize===  {| class=""wikitable"" |- !

The paper is currently published by the Pacific Newspaper Group, a division of [[Postmedia Network . It is published six days a week, Monday to Saturday.  Now combined with The Province newspaper, the ''Sun'' still has the largest newsroom of any newspaper in western Canada. The ''Sun'' is a [[broadsheet  newspaper and was not originally related to the [[Sun Media  chain and its tabloid ''Sun'' papers in [[Toronto Sun|Toronto , [[Ottawa Sun|Ottawa , [[Winnipeg Sun|Winnipeg , [[Calgary Sun|Calgary  and [[Edmonton Sun|Edmonton . However, Sun Media was acquired by Postmedia in 2015, making the ''Vancouver Sun'' and the tabloid ''Sun'' papers part of the same company.  == History == [[Image:Vancouver Sun Tower.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Sun Tower  was the newspaper's home from 1937 to 1965.   When the ''Sun'' began operation, it was published at 125 West Pender Street, just around the corner from ''[[The Province '', its rival at the time. From 1917 until his death in 1936, its publisher was [[Robert James Cromie .  In 1924, the Sun bought the ''[[Vancouver World '' newspaper, which had been in financial difficulty for some time.  In March 1937, a fire destroyed the ''Sun'''s business and editorial offices. The only casualty was the janitor, who suffered minor burns and smoke inhalation. The ''Sun'' promptly moved across the street into the World Building, where the ''World'' had been published. The building was accordingly renamed the [[Sun Tower .  In 1958, the ''Sun'' and the ''Province'' joined to create the ''Pacific Press'' in response to the rising costs of producing newspapers. First the papers merged their mechanical and financial departments, then they both moved into the Pacific Press Building on December 27, 1965.  The newspaper's [[photojournalism|photography department  became the first in the world to fully switch over to [[digital photography  following the 1994 release of the [[Kodak DCS 400 series , which used a [[Nikon F90  body; the camera was developed by [[Kodak  in collaboration with [[The Associated Press  and each unit cost $16,950.<ref name=""photo-digital""></ref> Later in 1997 the paper moved to [[Granville Square .  In 1997, Kennedy Heights, the printing press for the Vancouver Sun and The Province, was opened in Surrey.  In May 2009, the newspaper laid off long-time editorial cartoonist [[Roy Peterson  who had been drawing for the paper since 1962.  In December 2011, after much research on the demographics of the greater [[Vancouver  area, the newspaper launched a Chinese-language version ''[[Taiyangbao '' with original Chinese language content.  According to an article broadcast on China Now on [[China Radio International   December 2011 , the key to success was not necessarily to ""translate"" its English-language version into Chinese.  In January 2015, the Kennedy Heights printing press operation was shut down, resulting in 220 workers losing their jobs.  Printing of the Vancouver Sun and The Province were outsourced, each to different printing press operations.  In 2017, the Vancouver Sun and Province moved to east Vancouver, to the Broadway Tech Centre.   == Circulation == ''The Vancouver Sun'' has seen, like most [[List of newspapers in Canada#Daily newspapers|Canadian daily newspapers  a decline in [[Newspaper circulation|circulation .

A July 2008 article in the ''[[Ottawa Citizen '' included ''Jezebel'' as one of several sites launched as part of the ""online [[estrogen  revolution,"" referring to a [[comScore  finding that community-based women's websites were tied with political sites as the Internet's fastest-growing category. The article also cited ''[[Ad Age ''s research showing that women's Internet use is outpacing men's.  In 2010, ''Jezebel'' received widespread media coverage when it criticized ''[[The Daily Show '' for its treatment of women writers and correspondents. As a result of this publicity, the site was parodied as ""JoanOfSnark.com"" on an episode of ''[[30 Rock '', ""[[TGS Hates Women "".  A ''[[Slate  magazine |Slate '' article at the time criticized the blog and similar feminist blogs for manipulating readers to achieve page views by masking anger  often aimed at attractive women  as a result of jealousy and insecurity as ""righteously indignant rage"" and promoting in-group behavior at the expense of rational discourse.  Kashmir Hill of ''[[Forbes '' has been critical of the blog on two occasions. In 2012, ''Jezebel'' faced criticism when it published screen shots of a video depicting a rape and some users threatened to boycott the site. Later, in November 2012, ''Jezebel'' was criticized for publicizing the names of teenagers who posted racist tweets in response to [[Barack Obama 's re-election.  The website has been criticized at times for how it handles race issues, including its selection in July 2014 of a white woman as the new editor-in-chief over a black candidate who had been with the site since its founding.  In 2014, ''Jezebel'' writers accused the company Gawker Media of failing to address a campaign of harassment against its staff and readers, which included rape-themed images and threats of violence. In the post, which was titled ""We Have a Rape Gif Problem and Gawker Media Won't Do Anything About It"" the site's staff wrote that ""an individual or individuals has been using anonymous, untraceable burner accounts to post gifs of violent pornography in the discussion section of stories on ''Jezebel''"" for months.  In 2014, Caitlin Dewey of ''[[The Washington Post '' criticized ''Jezebel'' for its article about [[Vogue  magazine |''Vogue's''  February issue, which depicted a [[Photo manipulation|retouched  photograph of actress [[Lena Dunham  on its cover along with retouched images of her within. Dewey described it as a ""feminist self-parody"", stating that ""[Editor-in-chief Jessica] Coen doesn't just object to the type of unrealistic, unhealthy [[Photo manipulation#Photoshopping|Photoshopping  that warps our collective perception of what constitutes a normal size and shape, but to alterations of any kind"", which she believes ""doesn't really further that cause"" of combating distorted [[body image  in advertising.  Evolutionary theorist [[Geoffrey Miller  psychologist |Geoffrey Miller  has harshly criticized websites like ''Jezebel'' and discussed them in the context of modern [[witch hunt s and [[inquisition s.  ==References==   ==External links== *      [[Category:Gawker Media  [[Category:American blogs  [[Category:Women's websites  [[Category:Internet properties established in 2007  [[Category:Feminist blogs  [[Category:2007 establishments in the United States ","Jezebel is a liberal blog geared towards women, under the tagline ""Celebrity, Sex, Fashion for Women.

Founded on August 22, 1811, as the '''''Greensburg Gazette''''' and in 1889 consolidated with several papers into the '''''Greensburg Tribune-Review''''',<ref name=autogenerated5></ref> the paper circulated only in the eastern suburban counties of [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland  and parts of [[Indiana County, Pennsylvania|Indiana  and [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania|Fayette  until May 1992, when it began serving all of the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area  after a strike at the two Pittsburgh dailies, the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette '' and ''[[Pittsburgh Press '', deprived the city of a newspaper for several months.  The Tribune-Review Publishing Company was owned by [[Richard Mellon Scaife , an heir to the [[Mellon family|Mellon  banking, oil, and aluminum fortune, until his death in July 2014. Scaife was a major funder of conservative organizations, including the [[Arkansas Project .  Accordingly, the ''Tribune-Review'' has maintained a conservative editorial stance, contrasting with the more centrist ''Post-Gazette.''  In addition to its flagship paper, the company publishes 17 weekly community newspapers, the ''Pittsburgh Pennysaver'', as well as '''TribLive.com''' and '''TribTotalMedia.com'''.  == History ==  ===Origin=== The paper began as the ''Gazette'' on August 22, 1811. After a series of name changes and mergers it became the ''Greensburg Daily Tribune'' in 1889. In 1924, it and the ''Greensburg Morning Review'', launched by [[Dave Berry  American football |David J. Berry  in 1903, consolidated their interests under a single ownership.<ref name=""trib1955""></ref> Both papers continued separate publication until 1955, when they merged to form the ''Greensburg Tribune-Review''.<ref name=""trib1955""/> Scaife bought the ''Tribune-Review'' in 1970.  Scaife was a decade early in trying to unarm the ''Post-Gazette''. In 1981–82, he started a short-lived eastern suburbs paper, ''The Daily-Sunday Tribune''.<ref name=autogenerated1></ref>  ===Kent State and the Pulitzer=== <!-- Courtesy note per [[MOS:LINK2SECT : [[Valley News Dispatch  links here. --> The Tribune-Review owns several ""satellite"" papers that insert or surround the regional publication with neighborhood specific stories.  The ''Valley News Dispatch'', of Pittsburgh suburbs [[Tarentum, Pennsylvania|Tarentum  and [[New Kensington, Pennsylvania|New Kensington  is one such satellite.  Local journalism student [[John Filo  worked for the publication while attending nearby [[Kent State University  and served as the Valley News Dispatch's correspondent of the [[Kent State shootings . His photography that day has ascended to iconic status and won the paper its only [[Pulitzer Prize .  ===1990s expansion, and ''North Hills News Record''=== [[File:Pittsburgh newspaper consolidation timeline.png|right|250px|thumb|Pittsburgh newspaper consolidation timeline  During a newspaper strike that temporarily shut down the ''Post-Gazette'' and ultimately closed the ''Pittsburgh Press'', Scaife launched the ''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review'', an edition of the Greensburg-based ''Tribune-Review'' covering [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County  and Pittsburgh.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Over time, it became a stand-alone newspaper headquartered on Pittsburgh's North Side. In 1997, Scaife added to his small collection of newspapers by purchasing ''The Daily Courier'' of [[Connellsville, Pennsylvania|Connellsville , the ''Leader Times'' of [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania|Kittanning  and ''The Valley Independent'' of [[Monessen, Pennsylvania|Monessen  from [[Thomson Newspapers .  In late 1997, Scaife's NewsWorks facility opened in the [[North Hills  Pennsylvania |North Hills .<ref name=autogenerated3></ref> In December 1997, the Tribune-Review company purchased the ''North Hills News Record'', even though four months earlier, then-Trib president Ed Harrell told the ''Pittsburgh Business Times'' that the company was not interested in the ''News Record''.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Nine months after purchasing the ''North Hills News Record'' from [[Gannett Company , Tribune-Review Publishing Co. announced the paper would be merged with the ''Pittsburgh Trib''. ''The News Record'' was most successful during the newspaper strike of the early 1990s.<ref name=autogenerated2></ref> At its demise, the ''North Hills News Record'' had a daily circulation of more than 16,000, nearly 1,000 less than its circulation before the Trib bought it.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> In early 2000, the Trib announced the ""News Record"" name would retire after more than two years of a combined ""Tribune-Review/North Hills News Record"" banner. North Hills coverage would be wrapped into the Trib's neighborhoods section.  ===2000s mergers and consolidations=== In 2000, the Trib announced it would convert its [[Irwin, Pennsylvania|Irwin -based paper, the daily  except Sunday  ''Standard Observer'', into a twice-weekly regional section of the Greensburg ''Tribune-Review''. Citing a ""sagging economy"", the Trib laid off more than four percent of its workforce in 2003, including [[freelance writer s.<ref name=autogenerated4></ref> More shakeups continued in 2005 as circulation numbers dropped and a top official left. An online message board featured back and forth fights between Pittsburgh and Greensburg employees.<ref name=autogenerated4 />  Edward Harrell, then-president of the Tribune Review Publishing Company, announced in January 2005 that most of the regional editions of the paper would have their newsroom, management and circulation departments merged and staff reductions would follow. The merged papers include the ''Tribune-Review'' of Greensburg, the ''Valley News Dispatch'' of [[Tarentum, Pennsylvania|Tarentum , ''The Leader-Times'' of [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania|Kittanning , ''The Daily Courier'' of Connellsville and the ''Blairsville Dispatch''. ''The Valley Independent'', the only paper with a unionized newsroom and contract, was not affected.  The company incorporated as Trib Total Media in the summer of 2005, and purchased Gateway Newspapers, a community publication group servicing approximately 22 communities, at the time, in and around Pittsburgh's Allegheny County. Two managers were immediately laid off. The exact number of proposed redundancies was not announced. In September 2005, Harrell announced his retirement as president of Tribune-Review Publishing Company, effective December 31, 2005. He had served as president since 1989. Several staff writers were laid off in December 2005 as two of Gateway's newspapers were discontinued.  In May 2008, the ''Post-Gazette'' and the Trib reached a deal for one company to deliver both papers. The Post-Gazette would begin delivering the Trib to most of the area with some exceptions. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. On June 20, 2008, Trib Total Media publicly announced it was closing several weekly newspapers in the Gateway Newspapers chain. The papers affected include: ''Bridgeville Area News'', ''North Journal'', ''McKnight Journal'', ''Woodland Progress'', ''Penn Hills Progress'', ''Coraopolis-Moon Record'' and the ''Advance Leader''. Many of those papers were several decades old. The company also announced major changes to the remaining Gateway publications including a revamp of the Pennysaver in the communities that have Gateway newspapers. Several published reports say the remaining community newspapers would expand coverage to include areas no longer serviced by Gateway publications. The communities served by those titles will now be served by other Gateway newspapers.  ===2015 restructuring=== In November, 2015, Trib Total Media announced that they would be cutting back on home delivery of printed newspapers and emphasize digital delivery.<ref name=tribrestruct></ref> The restructuring included the sale of two dailies and six weeklies to West Penn Media.<ref name=tribsale></ref> Two papers were closed,<ref name=pgclose></ref> ''The Daily News'' in McKeesport,<ref name=monclosed></ref> and ''The Valley Independent'' in Monessen.<ref name=valleyclosed></ref>  The remaining papers, in Pittsburgh, Greensburg and Tarentum, became regional editions of a single title, the ''Tribune-Review''.  Home delivery was reduced in some parts of Allegheny and Westmoreland counties.<ref name=pgclose/> Trib Total Media laid off 153 full and part-time workers from its staff of approximately 1,100, another 68 had accepted buyouts in October.<ref name=""tribrestruct""/>  The Pittsburgh edition of the ''Tribune-Review'' went ""all-digital"" after it published its last print edition on November 30, 2016. The Greensburg-based Westmoreland edition and the Tarentum-based Valley News Dispatch edition remained in print.  == Investigations, national attention == [[Carl Prine , an investigative reporter for the newspaper, conducted a probe with the [[CBS  news magazine ''[[60 Minutes '' that highlighted the lack of security at the nation's most dangerous chemical plants following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks .  The reporters, and a CBS camera operator, were charged with trespassing at a Neville Island plant during their investigation. They were later acquitted when the judge accepted that the story had been in the public interest.  In 2007, Prine's further investigation into the subject was featured in the PBS documentary series [[Exposé: America's Investigative Reports , in a two-part episode titled ""Think Like A Terrorist.""  One Tribune-Review flap went national when [[Colin McNickle , then editor of the newspaper's editorial page, attended a July 26, 2004 speech at the [[Massachusetts  State House given by [[Teresa Heinz Kerry , who had been the subject of two negative articles in the Tribune-Review's opinion pages. After the speech, there was a dispute between McNickle and Heinz Kerry over her use of the term ""un-American activity.""  == Circulation == The daily Tribune-Review is published in three geographic editions: Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Valley News Dispatch.  The Tribune-Review claimed to show the highest gains in readership over the past five years of any newspaper in America's top 48 markets, which were dominated by sinking readership. The growth can be attributed to purchases of other newspapers which were then reclassified as editions of the Tribune Review.  According to surveys by International Demographics Inc., an independent media research firm in Houston, the number of Tribune-Review readers jumped 17.8 percent from 2007 to 2012.  As part of the ''Trib Total Media'' conglomerate, the Tribune-Review has a news exchange partnerships with WPXI, Pittsburgh's NBC affiliate and until 2013, it was a sister publication to Pittsburgh's second-largest news radio station, [[KQV . Trib Total Media is the Official Newspaper of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates  and the [[Pittsburgh Penguins   the latter of which Scaife was a co-founder in [[1967 NHL expansion|1967   and has strong partnerships with many nonprofit and community businesses and organizations throughout Western Pennsylvania.  == See also ==  * [[Arkansas Project  * [[Brad Bumsted  * [[Randy Bish  * ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ''  == Notes and references ==   == External links == * [http://www.triblive.com ''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review'' web site] * [http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A29147 ""Trials and Trib-ulations: An insider's look at Pittsburgh's second daily""], [[Pittsburgh City Paper , September 1, 2005    [[Category:Newspapers published in Pittsburgh  [[Category:Publications established in 1889 ","The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, also known as ""the Trib,"" is the second largest daily newspaper serving metropolitan Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the United States.

'''Euronews''' is a European pay television [[news broadcasting|news  network, headquartered in [[Lyon , France. The network began broadcasting on 1 January 1993, and aimed to cover world news from a [[Pan-European identity|pan-European  perspective.  It is jointly owned by several European and [[North Africa n state broadcasting organisations, and since 2015 majority owned  53%  by Media Globe Networks led by Egyptian billionaire [[Naguib Sawiris  who is chairman of the supervisory board.  ==History and organisation== [[File:Euronews_HQ_©euronews_photo_Stéphane_Audras_2015.10.15_ 169 .JPG|thumb|Euronews headquarters in Lyon   ===General=== In 1992, following the [[Gulf War|First Persian Gulf War , during which [[CNN 's position as the preeminent source of [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour news  programming was cemented, the [[European Broadcasting Union  decided to establish Euronews to present information from a European perspective. The channel's first broadcast was on 1 January 1993 from Lyon. An additional broadcast studio was set up in London in 1996. It was founded by a group of ten European public broadcasters:  *[[Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation|CyBC , Cyprus *[[France Télévisions , France *[[RAI , Italy *[[RTBF , Belgium *[[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal|RTP , Portugal *[[RTVE , Spain  former shareholder  *[[Télé Monte Carlo|TMC , Monaco  former shareholder  *[[Yleisradio|YLE , Finland *[[ERTU , Egypt  In 1997, the British news broadcaster [[ITN  purchased a 49 percent share of Euronews for £5.1&nbsp;million from [[Alcatel-Alsthom . ITN supplies the content of the channel along with the remaining shareholders, which are represented by the '''SOCEMIE'''    [[consortium . Euronews SA is the operating company that produces the channel and holds the broadcasting licence. It is co-owned by the ten founders and:  *[[All-Russia State Television and Radio Company|VGTRK , Russia *[[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT , Turkey *[[Česká televize|ČT , Czech Republic *[[Public Broadcasting Services|PBS , Malta *[[Société Nationale de Radiodiffusion et de Télévision|SNRT , Morocco *[[Radiotelevizija Slovenija|RTVSLO , Slovenia *[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ , Ireland *[[UA:PBC , Ukraine *[[SRG SSR|SRG-SSR , Switzerland *[[Televiziunea Română|TVR , Romania *[[Sveriges Television|SVT /[[Modern Times Group|MTG , Sweden *[[Établissement de la Radiodiffusion-Télévision Tunisienne|ERTT , Tunisia *[[Entreprise nationale de télévision|ENTV , Algeria  The broadcast switched from solely [[Analog transmission|analogue  to mainly [[Digital data|digital  transmission in 1999. In the same year, the Portuguese audio track was added. The Russian audio track appeared in 2001.  In 2003, ITN sold its stake in Euronews as part of its drive to streamline operations and focus on news-gathering rather than channel management.<ref name=""BroadcastMagazine""></ref>  On 6 February 2006, Ukrainian public broadcaster [[National Television Company of Ukraine|Natsionalna Telekompanya Ukraïny  NTU   purchased a one percent interest in SOCEMIE.<ref name=""digitalspy""></ref>  On 27 May 2008, Spanish public broadcaster [[RTVE  decided to leave Euronews to promote its international channel TVE Internacional. It also cited legal requirements to maintain low debt levels through careful spending as a factor influencing its decision to leave.<ref name=""elmundo""></ref>  In February 2009, the Turkish public broadcaster [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT  became a shareholder in the channel, and joined its supervisory board. TRT purchased 15.70% of the channel's shares and became the fourth main partner after France Télévisions  23.93% , RAI  21.54% , and [[All-Russia State Television and Radio Company|VGTRK   16.94% .  In February 2015, the channel's executive board approved a bid by Media Globe Networks, owned by Egyptian telecom magnate [[Naguib Sawiris , to acquire a 53% controlling stake in the media outlet. The deal raised questions over Euronews's future editorial posture and independence.  ===Language availability=== [[File:COTY 2018, Le Grand-Saconnex  1X7A9290 .jpg|thumb|Good Morning Europe anchor Belle Donati  {| class=""wikitable sortable"" |- ! # !

The service was designed for viewers for whom ""watching news is not an option"" by providing a direct simulcast to the TV channel, with ""No Comment"" segment being replaced by music. The music of the bulletin openings are also transmitted on Euronews Radio. Weather reports are read by a female announcer.  ===Africanews===   On 20 April 2016, the French subsidiary of Euronews launched an African version of their news service called Africanews in French and English.  ===Partnership with NBC=== In November 2016, the channel's executive board was in talks with [[NBCUniversal , parent company of [[NBC News , for a ""strategic partnership"". NBCU would acquire 15 to 30% ownership of the Euronews network, would contribute to Euronews content, and facilitate NBC News' expanded operations in Europe. After successful negotiations with the [[European Commission , who feared that the partnership would result on an ''Americanization'' of Euronews, the NBCUniversal News Group finally purchased a 25% stake in Euronews in February 2017 for $30&nbsp;million. NBC News president [[Deborah Turness  was appointed to head up international operations, and incumbent Euronews CEO Michael Peters, which has led it since 2004, became CEO of the new partnership. Both report directly to NBC News chairman [[Andrew Lack  executive |Andy Lack . The resulting partnership became known as Euronews NBC.    Although Sawiris and NBC News have the largest stakes in Euronews, editorial control by SOCEMIE members has been assured, with the broadcasters having seven slots in the editorial board, as opposed to Sawiris' company  which has three slots  and NBC News, which only has one, thereby reducing rumours of an ''Americanization'' of Euronews' values. Editorial control is fully handled by Euronews' teams, with NBC only focusing on planning and coordinating tasks.  After the formation of the partnership, video reports from NBC News' properties began to appear frequently on the TV channel and reports from [[NBCNews.com  began to be distributed on its digital platforms.   On 9 May 2017, Euronews split its service into 12 language-specific editions, of which nine have a linear TV channel with its own language voiceover, but now including contents, on-air graphics  except for some segments  and its lower-third news ticker in the language. The ''glocal'' strategy allows the language editorial teams to personalise the content and presentation of their channel, not only by sharing own-produced content with other languages, but by producing content that is relevant to local audiences, and allowing local reporters and presenters to appear on camera in all its language editions. The splitting process finished on 24 May 2017. <ref name="":0""></ref>  Alongside the major language split, satellite distribution for the German, Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish channels was discontinued, now being only available via fibre-optic IP uplink.<ref name="":0"" /> However, the discontinuation of the German-language channel from satellite distribution generated outcry from many German satellite TV owners, resulting on the restoration of the German-language channel on the [[Astra 1L  satellite on 25 July 2017, via an unencrypted SD feed sitting alongside the French-language channel.  Additionally, the Arabic and Persian language editions became available only on Euronews' website and apps, with the TV channels being discontinued, and the Ukrainian edition was discontinued outright, due to lack of funding from the Ukrainian government.  Finally, the Euronews channel in English became known as the ''World'' edition, and distribution to premises in the American continent via fibre-optic IP uplink is set to begin later in 2018. <ref name="":0"" /> These changes caused the elimination of 43 staff positions, mainly from the Ukrainian edition, causing major layoffs and production staff having more flexible roles.   In 2018, Euronews' English-language channel began to gradually revamp its programming schedule, with the roll-out of a new slate of presenter-led programming to complement its already existing shows, a move that was reported earlier in the year, after the success of its presenter-led special reports and weekly programming introduced in recent years. <ref name="":1""></ref> Alongside conventional rolling news shows, debate programming, talk shows and new presenter-led shows will be offered during the weekly schedule, and throughout programmes, Euronews reporters from different nationalities will be offering context on stories close to their respective home nationalities.   The roll-out began on 22 May, when Euronews debuted the first of these new shows, ''Good Morning Europe'', a five-hour morning show which airs every weekday morning from 7am. It was first anchored by former [[RT  TV network |RT  correspondent and [[TVB Pearl  news presenter Tesa Arcilla, which anchored it in a temporary basis. Some weeks later, former [[France 24  presenter [[Belle Donati  began presenting the show, alternating with Arcilla; after she moved to [[Brussels  in September, she became the main anchor of the slot. Two months later, on 17 July, Euronews debuted a six-hour breaking news show, ''Euronews Now'', anchored by Tokunbo Salako, covering the dayside and afternoon slots. On 3 September, the new evening programme lineup was launched, starting with a politics-focused show, ''Raw Politics'', hosted by Tesa Arcilla, and featuring former [[Sky News  reporter Darren McCaffrey from [[Brussels . Two weeks later, on 17 September, the full roll-out was completed with the introduction of a 5-hour evening rolling news show, ''Euronews Tonight'', presented by former [[Sky News  and [[BBC News  presenter Sam Naz.<ref name="":2""></ref> The traditional pre-produced blocks of video content still remains on late nights and weekends. Most overnights now repeat the previous day's edition  either full or half length  of ''Euronews Now''.  New weekly programming is also being produced, including the weekly interview series ''Uncut'', which feature conversations from political leaders and newsmakers worldwide with minimum to no editing. The first episodes feature German-French politician [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit  interviewing former [[UKIP  leader [[Nigel Farage  and former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister  [[Tony Blair  about [[Brexit . Additionally, a new social media unit was created, with journalists with a background on digital news verification leading it. The newly-created team help to produce ''The Cube'', a social media segment during rolling news shows, focusing on analysis on treatment and reactions about news headlines on social media, with special attention at the major stories of the day. ''No Comment'', a long-standing element of Euronews' programming, remains on the channels' schedule, and it's being gradually integrated into the rolling news shows on the English-language channel. <ref name="":2"" />  Additionally, a major investment in mobile reporting via [[iPhone  devices helped Euronews gain a major [[Scoop  news |scoop , becoming the only TV news outlet worldwide to broadcast live coverage from the [[Aquarius  NGO ship |MV Aquarius , with Paris correspondent Annelise Borges  formerly with [[France 24   on assignment. Borges broadcast live during 10 days as the new Italian far-right government denied the Aquarius access to Italian ports. The coverage made headlines on many news outlets worldwide, and helped Euronews boost its credibility and its audience.<ref name="":2"" /> The new Euronews also hired new correspondents in London, Berlin, Moscow, Rome, Madrid and Washington D.C., and gained access to NBC News' large network of correspondents worldwide.  As of September 2018, the other language editions are unaffected, with the pre-produced blocks of video content remaining at all times, although there are plans to introduce presenter-led programming during the morning slots on these other channels.<ref name="":1"" />  After the takeover of [[Sky plc  by NBCUniversal's parent company [[Comcast  on 22 September 2018, EuronewsNBC will increase its worldwide reach, as it plans to closely integrate its operations  and those of NBC News  with those of [[Sky News .  ==Broadcast== The channel is available in 430&nbsp;million households in 166 countries worldwide. It reaches more than 170&nbsp;million European households by [[cable television|cable , [[satellite television|satellite  and [[terrestrial television|terrestrial . It also began to secure availability on [[multimedia  platforms such as [[IPTV  and digital media.<ref name=""MediaPressPack""></ref>  Euronews launched an application for mobile devices  [[Android  operating system |Android , [[iPhone , and [[iPad   which is called ""Euronews Live"". The application is free of charge and is available on Google Play and the App Store. This app was later shut down quietly.  The following countries also broadcast Euronews through terrestrial channels for a limited amount of time:  *ArmNews.Eu  [[Sweden   in Russian *[[Face TV  Bosnia and Herzegovina |Face TV   [[Bosnia-Herzegovina   in English *[[Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation|CyBC  DTV Platform  [[Cyprus   in English and [[Modern Greek|Greek   also simulcasted by [[RIK 2  when its programming is over  *[[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT   [[Greece   in English and [[Modern Greek|Greek  *[[Télé Liban|TL   [[Lebanon   in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Arabic  daily at 8:00 *[[RTÉ One , [[RTÉ News Now   Ireland  in English *[[Extremadura TV , [[Aragón TV , [[7RM  Murcia  Spain  in [[Castilian Spanish|Spanish  *[[TVM  Malta |TVM   [[Malta   in English *[[RTP2  and [[RTP Açores   [[Portugal   in [[European Portuguese|Portuguese  *[[TVR News   [[Romania   in [[Romanian language|Romanian  *[[TV Koper-Capodistria   [[Slovenia   in Italian *[[RSI La 1  & [[RSI La 2   [[Switzerland   in Italian and [[Standard German|German  *[[RTS Un   [[Switzerland   in French and English *[[TRT Haber   [[Turkey   in [[Turkish language|Turkish    The channel's programmes are also available by [[podcast , and it has also maintained a YouTube channel since October 2007.  In 2012, the largest Belarusian state network MTIS stopped broadcasting Euronews for unknown reasons.  In 2013, the new commercial channel Planet TV started broadcasting Euronews dubbed in Slovenian after Antenna TV SL purchased a major stake in the company. Euronews airs after closedown  or sign-off  of Planet TV, but both call sign logos are displayed.  In September 2016, Euronews disappeared from the [[Freesat  channel list in the UK, in a move made by Sawiris.  In September 2017, VGTRK have ceased simulcasting Euronews to expand broadcasting hours of [[Russia-K  channel.  ===HD=== [[High-definition television|High-definition   HD  broadcasting was started on 2 November 2016 via satellite using [[Hot Bird -capacities  English audio only . Regarding the audio codec, Euronews used the [[Dolby Digital|AC3  format at the beginning here, changing to the [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC  codec in March 2017, and changing it again to the MPEG codec in April 2017.  ==Logos== [[File:Euronews logo globe.png|135px|thumb|right|Identifying graphic used with logo below  [[File:Euronews logo text.svg|135px|thumb|right|Logo used from October 1998 to June 2008  [[File:Euronews grey logo.svg|135px|thumb|right|Logo used from June 2008 to May 2016   The current Euronews logo is the fifth.

In 2005, the newspaper was ranked in the top 100 in daily/Sunday circulation in the [[United States . It has been owned by [[Advance Publications  since 1947.   On August 28, 2012, the newspaper's publisher announced that it would shift to a three-day print publication schedule beginning January 1, 2013, and expand its digital focus on its website, PennLive.com, and social-media platforms. This followed similar moves at other Advance-owned publications.  It is now published Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. Also, as of May 4, 2015, ''LNP'', a seven-day newspaper based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, is printed in the same facility as ''The Patriot-News''.  == History == ''The Patriot-News'' officially traces its history to March 4, 1854, with the founding of ''The Daily Patriot''.  Its heritage dates, however, to December 1820, involving a weekly newspaper named ''The Pennsylvania Intelligencer''.  In 1855, ''The Patriot'' bought the ''Democratic Union'', successor of the ''Intelligencer,'' and merged them into ''The Patriot & Union.''  It was a weekly paper, but published three days a week when the legislature was in session.  It became a daily publication again in 1868 as ''The Morning Patriot'', changing its name to the ''Harrisburg Daily Patriot'' in 1875 and dropping Harrisburg from its masthead in 1890.  The other half of the paper began in 1917 as ''The Evening News.''  In 1947, both papers were bought by Edwin Russell, with financial backing from the Newhouse chain, forerunner of Advance Publications.  Later that year, the Newhouse chain assumed majority ownership, though Russell remained as the papers' driving force until his death in 2001.<ref name=""history""></ref>  In 1996, ''The Patriot'' and ''Evening News'' merged into a single morning paper, ''The Patriot-News''.  For many years, ''The Patriot-News'' was infamous for an editorial printed by its predecessor, ''The Patriot & Union'', on November 24, 1863, in which it dismissed the [[Gettysburg Address  as ""silly remarks"" that should disappear into ""a veil of oblivion.""  On November 14, 2013, ''The Patriot-News'' issued a retraction, saying the ''Patriot & Union'' editorial board failed to recognize the ""momentous importance, timeless eloquence, and lasting significance"" of the Gettysburg Address.  The retraction received considerable national coverage; [[NPR  and [[Fox News Channel  interviewed several of the paper's editors.  Deputy opinion page editor Matthew Zencey said the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address was the perfect time to ask, ""Gee, can you believe what rock heads ran this outfit 150 years ago?""  From 1953 to 1980, ''The Patriot'' and ''The Evening News'' were operated alongside south-central Pennsylvania's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC  affiliate, WTPA. That station was sold to [[Los Angeles Times|Times Mirror  with the rest of the Newhouse television division in 1980 and is now [[WHTM-TV , owned by [[Nexstar Media Group .  ==Awards, honors, and special notice== Despite its modest size, ''The Patriot-News'' has consistently won top state journalism awards in competition with Pennsylvania's largest newspapers. In 2012, ''Patriot-News'' reporter [[Sara Ganim  and staff were awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize  for breaking the story of the [[Penn State child sex abuse scandal|Penn State sex abuse scandal .<ref name=PP01/>  In 2003, the paper won the Pennsylvania Newspaper Association]s G. Richard Dew Award for Journalistic Service for its coverage of the attempted sale of [[Hershey Foods . In 2004, the newspaper was named as one of ""10 That Do It Right"" by [[Editor & Publisher  magazine. The newspaper has won the [[Pennsylvania Newspaper Association 's Keystone Press Award Division I Sweepstakes, which goes to the large metro newspaper that wins the most journalism awards, in 2004, 2006, and 2010, competing against the newspapers in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Allentown as the smallest paper in that division.  The year 2004 also began a run in the Pennsylvania Newspaper Association's Newspaper of the Year Awards unmatched in the contest's history. ''The Patriot-News'' has been either first or second place as the state's Newspaper of the Year for seven years in a row, with first-place wins in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2010. The contest includes more than 50 newspapers from across the state, including Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.  The newspaper's reporters have won the Pennsylvania Newspaper Association's Distinguished Writing Award multiple times, most recently to reporter John Luciew in 2013. The first award went to reporter Jim Lewis in 2001, 2004, and 2005. Reporter Ford Turner won second place in 2008 and first place in 2010.   In 2007, public watchdog reporter [[Jan Murphy  won a First Amendment award from the Associated Press Managing Editors for her stories uncovering profligate spending at [[PHEAA , the state agency that gives college loans to students. That same year, reporter Ford Turner won the APME's Public Service award for uncovering an unusually high rate of cancer among residents of a small neighborhood of [[Selinsgrove, PA|Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania . Murphy also won first prize in investigative reporting from the [http://www.ewa.org/site/PageServer National Education Writers Association] for her stories on PHEAA spending.  The World Association of Newspapers Young Reader Prize for Newspaper in Education in 2007 was awarded to ''The Patriot-News'' for its SchoolHouse News program with the [[Harrisburg School District  Pennsylvania |Harrisburg  Pa.  School District .  Investigative reporter [[Peter Shellem|Pete Shellem , who died in 2009, received widespread recognition for his work in freeing the innocent from prison. Shellem's stories in ''The Patriot-News'' resulted in the release of four people who had been convicted of murder: Patty Carbone, who had served 11 years; Steven Crawford, who had served 28 years; Barry Laughman, who had served 16 years; and David Gladden, who had served 12 years. His reporting also freed Charles Dubs, who had served five years on a rape conviction. In ''The New York Times'' obituary for Shellem, [[Barry Scheck , co-director of the Innocence Project at the [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law  at Yeshiva University, called him ""a rare, one-man journalism innocence project.""  Crime reporter and [[Penn State  grad Sara Ganim began gaining national attention in the wake of the Penn State sex abuse scandal after coach [[Jerry Sandusky 's indictment in November 2011. Ganim had written a substantial piece in March 2011, when few others were covering the story. Among other follow-ups, she then spoke to two of the mothers of alleged victims for the paper in the immediate wake of the indictment. “You can credit the ''Patriot-News'' with giving me the time a reporter needs to cover this kind of story,"" she said to a New York media columnist who specially noted her coverage. Ganim garnered a number of awards and notices for the reporting and, in March 2012, the [[Scripps Howard Foundation|Scripps Howard  Award for Community Journalism. In April 2012, Ganim and the news staff were awarded the 2011 [[Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting  for the coverage.<ref name=PP01></ref>  ==Audience== In 2012, the paper drew 476,000 readers weekly in print and on PennLive.

The paper is the second largest in the state  first is the  ''[[Charlotte Observer '' . The paper has  been awarded three [[Pulitzer Prize s; the most recent of which was in 1996 for a series on the health and environmental impact of North Carolina's booming hog industry. The paper was one of the first in the world to launch an online version of the publication, [[Nando|Nando.net  in 1994.  ==History== The ''News & Observer'' traces its roots to ''The Sentinel,'' which was founded by the Rev. William E. Pell in 1865 'to help expose corruption in state politics""  to maintain [[white supremacy   during the [[Reconstruction Era .  paper's struggles to stay relevant and make money led to new ownership in 1868. With the new owner ''The Sentinel'' began to cover the [[Democratic Party  United States |Democrats ' push to retake the [[North Carolina General Assembly|North Carolina Legislature , along with the impeachment of [[William Woods Holden|Gov. William W. Holden  in 1871. [[File:Josephus Daniels 1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Josephus Daniels, the principal shaper of ''The News & Observer''  ''The Sentinel'' went bankrupt a little over ten years after the paper was first founded. The owners of the newly founded ''Raleigh Observer'', Peter M. Hale and [[William L. Saunders , bought the now-bankrupt paper, ending its publication and focusing on the ''Raleigh Observer''. After about ten years the paper ran out of money, so the two owners sold to the owner of the ''Raleigh News'', Samuel A. Ashe.  Ashe combined the two papers under the new banner ''The News & Observer'' in September 1880, making it the sole daily paper in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh . Ashe ran the company personally until 1894, focusing on politics and the [[Democratic Party  United States |Democratic  party. Ashe used connections within the Democratic Party to get an upper leg on upcoming stories. This model worked well for the paper until Ashe lost favor in the Democratic [[caucus , leading the paper to fall on hard financial times for the fourth time in its history.  ===The voice of white supremacy=== In 1894 the paper was sold at auction, this time to a [[Washington, North Carolina  native who was a strong Democratic supporter. [[Josephus Daniels , with help from [[Julian Carr  industrialist |Julian S. Carr  and other friends, bought the paper. Quickly Daniels refocused the ''News and Observer'' to combat rampant corruption and other problems he saw within the state. Put differently by Daniels himself, ""The ''News and Observer'' was relied upon to carry the Democratic message and to be the militant voice of [[White Supremacy , and it did not fail in what was expected, sometimes going to extremes in its partisanship.""<ref name=Campbell></ref> Daniels believed that ""the greatest folly and crime"" in U.S. history was giving negros the vote.<ref name=Campbell/>  In the Findings of the Wilmington Race Riot Commission, Daniels is the only name mentioned as a cause of the [[Wilmington insurrection of 1898 ,<ref name=Report></ref> According to historian Helen Edmonds, the paper ""led in a campaign of prejudice, bitterness, vilification, misrepresentation, and exaggeration to influence the emotions of the whites against the Negro.""<ref name=Report/> The result was the only successful ''[[coup d'état '' in American history, the overthrow of an elected government by force.  In 1900 he used the paper to support soon-to-be Governor [[Charles Brantley Aycock|Charles B. Aycock , another white supremacist, during his bid for the office. He also used the paper to advocate [[Women's suffrage|female suffrage , [[workers' compensation , state industrialization, better roads and [[crop rotation .  Daniels also used the ''News and Observer'' to persuade [[North Carolina  citizens to support the [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchisement  of blacks in the 1910s and 1920s. Daniels later [[renounce d the racist policies of the 1910s ''News and Observer''.  In 2006, on occasion of the release of the report of the 1898 Wilmington Race Riot Commission, the newspaper offered ""an apology for the acts of someone [Daniels] we continue to salute in a different context…and for the misdeeds of the paper as an institution."" The newspaper published a 16-page special report on the events of 1898.  ===After Daniels=== Daniels continued to run the paper until his death in the mid-1940s. After his death his four sons assumed management of the company. All four sons contributed to the operation of the paper, but [[Jonathan W. Daniels|Jonathan Daniels , editor from 1933 to 1941 and from 1948 until 1964, kept the paper in the direction of appealing for school desegregation and a reduction in race related discrimination. It was also under Jonathan's leadership that ''The News and Observer'' bought out the ''[[Raleigh Times '' and moved to a building on South McDowell St. in [[downtown Raleigh , where they stayed until the building was sold in 2015.  On September 3, 1934, ''The News and Observer'' began a column about state politics called ""Under the Dome"", which started on the back page, moved to the front and now runs in the local section.  In 1968, the Daniels family hired [[Claude Sitton , who had been a correspondent for ''[[The New York Times '' and later an editor there. Serving as the editorial director of the paper, he promoted ''The News & Observer'' as a government watchdog and moved the news of the paper away from the personal and partisan stances it had taken under [[Josephus Daniels . However, its editorials were still often aligned with the Democratic Party.  A year later, the ''[[Mini Page '' children's supplement was created and published. Today, it is one of America's most widely used children's newspaper supplements.  In 1971, Sitton became the editor and the paper began buying and publishing smaller local newspapers, starting with ''The Island Packet'' in [[Hilton Head, South Carolina  and ''The Cary News'' in [[Cary, North Carolina .  On March 16, 1980, a welder's torch started a fire and burned through newsprint threaded through the press, injuring three and causing millions in damage.  In 1987, the staffs of ''The News & Observer'' and ''The [[Raleigh Times '' merged, and on November 30, 1989, the last edition of ''The [[Raleigh Times '' was published. In 1988, ''The News & Observer'' endorsed its first [[Republican Party  United States |Republican  candidate for statewide election, showing, perhaps, a distancing from Democratic partisanship.  Throughout the early 1990s, ''The News & Observer'' divested itself of various local newspapers in South Carolina and the North Carolina mountains, and by September 1993, Sunday sales of ''The News & Observer'' reached 200,000 for every week. However, the newspaper still owns ''The Cary News'', ''Chapel Hill News'', and the ''Smithfield Herald'' among other newspapers. In 1994, the paper created [[Nando .net, becoming an Internet service provider and began publishing the [[NandO Times  online newspaper.  In 1999, ''The News & Observer'' was named one of America's 100 best newspapers by the [[Columbia Journalism Review , and one of the 17 best-designed newspapers in the world by the [[Society for News Design .  With McClatchy's acquisition of most of [[Knight Ridder 's properties in 2006, the state's two largest papers—the ''N&O'' and the ''[[Charlotte Observer ''—are now under common ownership.  In September 2008, the ''News and Observer'' offered buyouts to all 320 newsroom employees, approximately 40% of its staff, in an effort to cut expenses. Previously the company had shut down its Durham news bureau and in a separate event laid off 70 employees. Layoffs and buyouts have continued since then. [http://graphicdesignr.net/papercuts/index.php?s=%22news+%26+observer%22]  In 2015 the newspaper announced it would sell its facility in downtown Raleigh for redevelopment, which will entail demolition of much of the facility. New presses will be installed at the newspaper's auxiliary production facility in [[Garner, North Carolina|Garner . Editorial offices will remain in a portion of the redeveloped facility.  ==Awards == ; 1996 – Pulitzer Prize in Public Service : In the Winter of 1995 ''The News & Observer'' released a nine part series on  the booming pork industry in [[North Carolina . The series covered environmental and health risk of the waste disposal systems used within the pork industry in the state. The award was presented to the paper for the work done by Melanie Sill, Pat Stith and, [[Joby Warrick .  ; 1989 – Pulitzer Prize in Criticism : [[Michael Skube  was awarded for his writing about books and other literary topics.  ; 1983 – Pulitzer Prize in Commentary : [[Claude Sitton  was awarded for his distinguished commentary.  ==Ownership == On May 17, 1995 the News & Observer Publishing Company was sold to [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy Newspapers  of [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento , [[California  for $373 Million ending 101 years of Daniels family ownership. In the mid-1990s [[Flexography|Flexo  Machines were installed allowing the paper to print thirty-two pages in color which was the largest capacity of any newspaper within the United States at the time. The McClatchy Co. Currently operates a total of twenty-nine daily newspapers in fourteen states with a combined weekday circulation of 1.6 million and a Sunday circulation of 2.4 million.  ==Other publications == The News & Observer Publishing Co. owns ten [[Bi-weekly newspaper|bi-weekly  newspapers that are no longer published, as of January 2018.

292,Y,news24.com,"  News 24          '''News24.com''' is an English-language [[South Africa n online news publication created in October 1998 by the multinational media company, [[Naspers .    == History == === 1998–2001: Early years === News24 was launched in October 1998 as part of Naspers’ new internet strategy. Naspers’ new managing director at the time, Koos Bekker, wanted to expand the company's online portfolio by offering News24 users breaking news around the clock.  Rossouw was appointed News24's first publisher. News24 focused on offering its users breaking local news, while relying on wire copy to keep them informed of international news. Within its first year, News24 became the biggest news website in South Africa.  Initially based in Johannesburg, News24 relocated to Cape Town in 2001 to form part of the newly created Media24 Digital division under the leadership of Russell Hanly. The move was brought on by the restructuring of Media24's digital operations. Soon the need to restructure arose, and News24's employees were cut from 30 to 18, with Douw Steyn as business manager and Cobus Heyl as editor. During this time, Independent Newspaper's IOL overtook News24 as South Africa's number one news website.  However, according to Heyl, ""this deficit was made up in the first two months of operation in Cape Town through renewed focus on breaking news. While we publish in text and pictures, News24 should have more uninterrupted broadcast news than daily newspaper news."" Most of News24's content  70%  came from the wires or translated newspaper articles  20% , yet steps were taken to produce more original content.  === 2001: Reality TV and terror attacks === Two events in 2001 significantly increased News24's popularity amongst internet users. The first Big Brother South Africa reality television show and the [[September 11 terrorist attacks  on the [[World Trade Center  1973–2001 |World Trade Center  in New York City boosted News24's momentum beyond expectation.  Even though Big Brother South Africa wasn't a traditional news event, the site couldn't ignore the show's popularity – especially to those who had access to the internet, as they were captivated by the housemates’ shenanigans. News24 brought users live updates and screengrabs as events happened. This worked well with the trend of high internet usage during the day and TV usage at night.  Heyl described 11 September 2001 as ""one of the most exciting afternoons at News24. This was undoubtedly the day News24 stopped crawling and started walking."" After the first plane hit the World Trade Center, News24's editorial team immediately switched from the Big Brother live application, to focus on images of the unfolding event in the US, commenting on the news as it came in. Other groups in the 24.com network also contributed content by writing background pieces, creating slideshows, graphics and maps. ""Within seconds to minutes all the news on the homepage was replaced with news reports and some of the most dramatic news pictures ever seen,"" said Heyl. The marketing team organised live reads on radio, which made News24 the local breaking news site on the event in South Africa. ""As far as usage was concerned, News24 never looked back again,"" said Heyl.  ===  2002: Restructuring === Despite the fact that News24's traffic continued to climb, it was still struggling to turn a profit and in September 2002 the operation was restructured again. The editorial team was cut back to 12. Heyl took over as business manager, while Bryan Porter became editor. News24 became central to all of Media24 Digital's sites and re-launched in December 2002. For the first time News24's potential to traffic users to other Media 24 Digital sites in the 24.com network was used. The new template included strong homepage focus areas showcasing content from other 24.com sites like Health24, Food24 and Women24.  === 2003 to 2006: profit, TV and mobile === In 2003, Media24 Digital's advertising team began to earn commission. News24 was the company's best performing digital unit in terms of usage and revenue with remarkable Y-on-Y revenue growth in 2003 and 2004.  During this period News24 branced out into TV and cellphones.  The South African Internet market had few ""at home"" users. Dial-up internet was slow and expensive, which resulted in most people accessing the internet from work. News24's online usage would peak during office hours and significantly drop at night and over the weekends. It was decided that News24 would launch on DStv's interactive platform to strengthen its brand usage during off-peak hours.  At the same time, News24 was working on its first WAP site to make content available on cellphones. According to Porter, ""This heralded a new brand position for News24 – ‘Anywhere, Anytime’, meaning our users could access the news wherever they were, whenever they liked, on the device of their choice.""  To differentiate themselves from their competitors in a market that relied heavily on wire service content, News24 began to recruit regular columnists to cover a wide range of issues. The columnist section was launched in mid 2004, focusing on news analysis, as well as financial and sport commentary.  Usage-wise, News24 became the first online site to register one million unique local users in a single month and during the course of 2004 witnessed some profitable months. In November 2004, Heyl was replaced as business manager by the Sunday Times's Elan Lohmann. Porter remained as editor and Jannie Momberg and Elmarie Jack as news editors. Lohmann sought to monetise News24 by restructuring the advertising model, extending the product offering and focussing on a more service-orientated approach to advertisers.4 Momberg became the editor of News24 in 2006.  ===  2007: MyNews24 === News24 introduced a user-generated content section in 2007 to reflect the web 2.0 and the growth of social media. This section in effect replaced the letters section of the site and allowed users to have their articles, and later photos and blogs published.  === 2009: Facelift === In May 2009 News24 underwent a facelift to update its look.  New features on the site included: Inside News24, which offered users links to more in-depth  content from other 24.com channels. Two new sections, Opinion and Multimedia, were created as well.  MyNews24 experienced major changes as users could now rate content and authors, user-generated photographs featured more and the leaderboard allowed users to track the performance of their articles. By 2009 user-generated content had grown by 79%.  News24 ended the year on a high note with a record-breaking 1.5 million unique local users visiting the site in the month of November.  === 2010: Over two million users === In April 2010, News24 became the first South African website and online news provider to reach more than two million domestic unique browsers  UBs  in a month. Including international readership, the site reached over 2.8 million unique users in April.  ""Given that no other news site to date has surpassed the one million UB mark, the two million South Africans per month milestone is a major achievement and proves we are on the cutting-edge of local internet engagement,"" said Momberg.  News24’s mobile application also experienced significant growth. Traffic to the site’s WAP application increased by more than 124% from February to April in 2010.  === 2011: Exploring new markets === In April 2011, News24 launched a Zulu language news site to meet the public’s demand for news in their home language. As expected, the site quickly flourished on the mobile platform, offering a new channel of accessing news for users who do not access the web through a computer.  News24 Kenya was launched in October 2011, followed by News24 Nigeria in June 2012 in a bid to create a presence in other African territories. As expected, the growth of the sites has been most obvious on mobile.  == Content == === News === The main news sections on the site are South Africa, World, Africa, Travel, Technology, Green and Opinion. News24 also publishes Special Reports  SA Politics, Zimbabwe, AIDS Focus and more  that offer readers in-depth coverage of the most important news events.  Regular columnists feature on the site and deliver comments on events in the news. Reportage on business news is done through Fin24.com and on sport through Sport24.co.za.   Entertainment news is reported on Channel24.co.za.  === MyNews24 === Inspired by the South Korean citizen journalism website, OhmyNews, News24 launched MyNews24 in 2007. This section allows users to publish their own articles and photographs. Cathryn Reece, who was in charge of running MyNews24, said that it took some time for it to take off, but that the number of unique users have grown from 5,000 in 2007 to 183,000 in 2010 and 480,500 in May 2014.  While users can write about whatever they want, Reece said that most of the submissions they receive are “news-related opinion based articles”. The amount of user-generated content is also dependent on news events.  Photographs sent in by users are “a big component” of MyNews24. Reece said that it seems that more people are willing to send in photographs if they witness something newsworthy than actually write an article about it. Also, through advertising the fact that users can publish photographs on MyNews24, many have become used to the idea of sending in images. According to Momberg, MyNews24 allows users to “engage with the news of the day, giving it more depth and public perspective”.  ===  Lifestyle === News24 links to softer health, lifestyle, and entertainment stories across the 24.com network through their Special Focus or Inside News24 sections, both of which appear on the homepage.  Other 24.com sites include: •	Health24 •	Women24 •	Traveller24 •	Wheels24 •	Food24 •	GoTravel24 •	Channel24 •	Parent24 •	Ancestry24 •	Careers24 •	Property24 •	isiZulu News24 •	Wheels24 •	Fin24 •	News24 Nigeria •	News24 Kenya  === Multimedia === Multimedia has been part of News24 since 2009. The site’s multimedia coverage is offered across the site’s news sections with specific significance to locally produced South African content.  Having grown to an average of 150,000 unique browsers per month, it is the biggest multimedia component of a news website in South Africa.  == Mobile == In 2003 News24 started to develop its WAP site to make content available on cellphones. Mobile was identified as a key growth sector for News24.  In South Africa, and other African countries, internet penetration is still low as many people only have web access at work, while others don’t have any access at all. However, South Africa’s cellular penetration stood at 98% in 2009. This, coupled with the increased availability of cheaper smartphones, would suggest that more and more people are accessing the internet from their phones.  By visiting m.news24.com, users can download the mobile version of News24, which is designed for smaller cellphone screens.  === Applications === News24's iPhone application was the first application of its kind among digital news sources in South Africa. The application is available for Apple, Windows, BlackBerry, Android users, as well as Java-enabled phones, and includes top stories, multimedia, the latest sport and entertainment news – and so much more. The application can also be used to submit  news tips or photographs.  The News24 app is the most downloaded news application in Africa .  In August 2010, News24 launched its iPad application, the first of its kind in South Africa. The application takes advantage of the iPads bigger screen and is a hybrid of the current iPhone application and the website.  == Interactive TV == News24’s interactive channel on DStv was launched in October 2003. This service allows DStv subscribers to view News24’s top stories via their TV sets. Other sections include general news, sport and finance, with particular focus on South Africa and Africa.  The decision to launch this channel was inspired by the trend in South Africa whereby internet usage drops significantly after office hours and TV usage rises at night. When stories are updated on the website, they are automatically fed to DStv, which is updated at various intervals, day and night, seven days a week.  == References == * News24 turns ten.

Founded in 1847, and formerly self-styled as the ""World's Greatest Newspaper""  for which WGN [[WGN  AM |radio  and [[WGN-TV|television  are named , it remains the most-read daily newspaper of the [[Chicago metropolitan area  and the [[Great Lakes region . It is the eighth-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation  and became the second-largest under Tribune's ownership after the ''Chicago Tribune''s parent company purchased the ''[[Los Angeles Times '' .<ref name=""top 100 daily""></ref>  Traditionally published as a [[broadsheet , on January 13, 2009, the ''Tribune'' announced it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery, but would publish in [[Tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid  format for newsstand, news box, and commuter station sales. This change, however, proved to be unpopular with readers and in August 2011, the ''Tribune'' discontinued the tabloid edition, returning to its traditional broadsheet edition through all distribution channels.  The ''Tribune''s [[Masthead  publishing |masthead  is notable for displaying the [[American flag , in reference to the paper's motto, ""An American Paper for Americans."" The motto is no longer displayed on the masthead, where it was placed below the flag.  ==History==  ===Beginnings=== The ''Tribune'' was founded by [[James Kelly  journalist |James Kelly , John E. Wheeler, and Joseph K. C. Forrest, publishing the first edition on June 10, 1847. Numerous changes in ownership and editorship took place over the next eight years. Initially, the ''Tribune'' was not politically affiliated, but tended to support either the [[Whig Party  United States |Whig  or [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil  parties against the [[Democratic Party  United States |Democrats  in elections. By late 1853, it was frequently running [[xenophobic  editorials that criticized foreigners and [[Roman Catholics . About this time it also became a strong proponent of [[The Temperance movement in the United States|temperance . However [[nativism  politics |nativist  its editorials may have been, it was not until February 10, 1855 that the ''Tribune'' formally affiliated itself with the nativist American or [[Know-Nothing movement|Know Nothing  party, whose candidate [[Levi Boone  was elected [[Mayor of Chicago  the following month.  ===Medill editorship=== [[File:Chicago Tribune Advertisement 1870.jpg|thumb|left|An 1870 advertisement for ''Chicago Tribune'' subscriptions  [[File:Cheer up.jpg|thumb|The lead editorial in the first issue the ''Chicago Tribune'' published after the [[Great Chicago Fire    By about 1854, part-owner Capt. J. D. Webster, later General Webster and chief of staff at the [[Battle of Shiloh , and Dr. Charles H. Ray of [[Galena, Illinois , through [[Horace Greeley , convinced [[Joseph Medill  of [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland 's ''[[The Plain Dealer|Leader '' to become managing editor. Ray became editor-in-chief, Medill became the managing editor, and [[Alfred Cowles, Sr. , brother of [[Edwin Cowles , initially was the bookkeeper. Each purchased one third of the ''Tribune''. Under their leadership, the ''Tribune'' distanced itself from the Know Nothings, and became the main Chicago organ of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party . However, the paper continued to print anti-Catholic and anti-Irish editorials, in the wake of the massive Famine immigration from Ireland.  The ''Tribune'' absorbed three other Chicago publications under the new editors: the ''[[Free West '' in 1855, the ''[[Democratic Press '' of [[William Bross  in 1858, and the ''[[Chicago Democrat '' in 1861, whose editor, [[John Wentworth  mayor |John Wentworth , left his position when elected as Mayor of Chicago. Between 1858 and 1860, the paper was known as the ''[[Chicago Press & Tribune ''. On October 25, 1860, it became the ''Chicago Daily Tribune''. Before and during the [[American Civil War , the new editors strongly supported [[Abraham Lincoln , whom Medill helped secure the presidency in 1860, and pushed an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist  agenda. The paper remained a force in Republican politics for years afterwards.  In 1861, the ''Tribune'' published new lyrics by [[William Weston Patton|William W. Patton  for the song ""[[John Brown's Body "". These rivaled [[The Battle Hymn of the Republic|the lyrics  published two months later by [[Julia Ward Howe . Medill served as mayor of Chicago for one term after the [[Great Chicago Fire  of 1871.  ===Years of McCormick=== Under the 20th-century editorship of Colonel [[Robert R. McCormick , who took control in the 1920s, the paper was strongly [[United States non-interventionism|isolationist  and aligned with the [[Old Right  United States |Old Right  in its coverage of political news and social trends. It used the motto ""The American Paper for Americans"". Through the 1930s to the 1950s, it excoriated the [[Democratic Party  United States |Democrats  and the [[New Deal  of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt , was resolutely disdainful of the British and French, and greatly enthusiastic for [[Chiang Kai-shek  and Sen. [[Joseph McCarthy .  When McCormick assumed the position of co-editor  with his cousin [[Joseph Medill Patterson   in 1910, the ''Tribune'' was the third-best-selling paper among Chicago's eight dailies, with a circulation of only 188,000.<ref name=""current"">""Robert R. McCormick,"" ''Current Biography 1941'', pp. 545–547.</ref> The young cousins added features such as advice columns and homegrown comic strips such as ''[[Little Orphan Annie '' and ''[[Moon Mullins ''. They promoted political ""crusades"", with their first success coming with the ouster of the Republican political boss of Illinois, Sen. [[William Lorimer  politician |William Lorimer .<ref name=""current"" /> At the same time, the ''Tribune'' competed with the Hearst paper, the ''[[Chicago American|Chicago Examiner '', in a circulation war. By 1914, the cousins succeeded in forcing out Managing Editor William Keeley. By 1918, the ''Examiner'' was forced to merge with the ''[[Chicago Record-Herald|Chicago Herald ''.  [[File:Chicago Tribune, September 4, 1919.gif|thumb|upright|''Tribune'' in 1919   In 1919, Patterson left the ''Tribune'' and moved to New York to launch his own newspaper, the New York ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News ''.<ref name=""current""/> In a renewed circulation war with Hearst's ''Herald-Examiner'', McCormick and Hearst ran rival lotteries in 1922. The ''Tribune'' won the battle, adding 250,000 readers to its ranks. Also in 1922, the ''Chicago Tribune'' hosted an international [[Architectural design competition|design competition  for its new headquarters, the [[Tribune Tower . The competition worked brilliantly as a publicity stunt, and more than 260 entries were received. The winner was a [[neo-Gothic  design by New York architects [[John Mead Howells  and [[Raymond Hood .  The newspaper sponsored a pioneering attempt at Arctic aviation in 1929, an attempted round-trip to Europe across [[Greenland  and [[Iceland  in a [[Sikorsky Aircraft|Sikorsky  amphibious aircraft. But, the aircraft was destroyed by ice on July 15, 1929, near [[Ungava Bay  at the tip of [[Labrador , Canada. The crew were rescued by the Canadian science ship [[CSS Acadia|CSS ''Acadia'' .  The ''Tribune''s reputation for innovation extended to radio—it bought an early station, WDAP, in 1924 and renamed it [[WGN  AM  , the station [[call letters  standing for the paper's self-description as the ""World's Greatest Newspaper'. [[WGN-TV|WGN Television  was launched April 5, 1948. These broadcast stations remain ''Tribune'' properties to this day and are among the oldest newspaper/broadcasting cross-ownerships in the country.  The ''Tribune''s East Coast sibling, the New York ''Daily News'', later established [[WPIX  television and radio.   The ''Tribune''s legendary sports editor [[Arch Ward  created the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game  in 1933 as part of the city's [[Century of Progress  exposition.  From 1940 to 1943 the paper supplemented its comic strip offerings with ''The Chicago Tribune Comic Book'', responding to the new success of [[comic book s. At the same time, it launched the more successful and longer lasting ''[[Spirit  comics |The Spirit Section '', which was also an attempt by newspapers to compete with the new medium.  During the McCormick years, the ''Tribune'' was a champion of [[modified spelling  for simplicity  such as spelling ""although"" as ""altho"" . McCormick, a vigorous campaigner for the Republican Party, died in 1955, just four days before Democratic boss [[Richard J. Daley  was elected mayor for the first time.  One of the great scoops in ''Tribune'' history came when it obtained the text of the [[Treaty of Versailles  in June 1919. Another was its revelation of United States war plans on the eve of the [[Pearl Harbor  attack. The ''Tribune''s June 7, 1942, front page announcement that the United States had broken Japan's naval code was the revelation by the paper of a closely guarded military secret. The story revealing that Americans broke the enemy naval codes was not cleared by censors, and had US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt  so enraged that he considered shutting down the ''Tribune''.  ===1948 U.S. presidential election=== [[File:Deweytruman12.jpg|thumb|alt=Man in gray suit and wire glasses holding newspaper that says ""[[Dewey Defeats Truman ""|[[Harry S. Truman|Truman  was widely expected to lose the 1948 election, and the ''Chicago Tribune'' ran the incorrect headline, ""[[Dewey Defeats Truman "".   The paper is well known for a mistake it made during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential election . At that time, much of its composing room staff was on strike. The early returns led editors to believe  along with many in the country  that the Republican candidate [[Thomas Dewey  would win. An early edition of the next day's paper carried the headline ""[[Dewey Defeats Truman "", turning the paper into a collector's item. Democrat [[Harry S. Truman  won and proudly brandished the newspaper in a famous picture taken at [[St. Louis Union Station .  Beneath the headline was a [[Dewey defeats Truman|false article , written by Arthur Sears Henning, which purported to describe West Coast results although written before East Coast election returns were available.  ===The Watergate years=== Colonel McCormick prevented the ''Tribune'' for years from participating in the [[Pulitzer Prize  competition. But it has won 25 of the awards over the years, including many for [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing|editorial writing .<ref name=""chicagotribune.com""></ref> The ''Tribune'' won its first post-McCormick Pulitzer in 1961, when [[Carey Orr  won the award for editorial cartooning. Reporter [[George William Bliss|George Bliss  won a Pulitzer the following year for reporting, and reporter [[Bill Jones  journalist |Bill Jones  another in 1971 for reporting.<ref name=""chicagotribune.com""/> A reporting team won the award in 1973, followed by reporter [[William Mullen  journalist |William Mullen  and photographer [[Ovie Carter , who won a Pulitzer for international reporting in 1975. A local reporting team won the award in 1976, and architecture critic [[Paul Gapp  won a Pulitzer in 1979.<ref name=""chicagotribune.com""/>  In 1969, under the leadership of publisher [[Harold Grumhaus  and editor [[Clayton Kirkpatrick   1915–2004 , the ''Tribune''s began reporting from a wider viewpoint. The paper retained its Republican and conservative perspective in its editorials, but it began to publish perspectives in wider commentary that represented a spectrum of diverse opinions, while its news reporting no longer had the conservative slant it had in the McCormick years.  In early 1974, in a major feat of journalism, the ''Tribune'' published the complete 246,000-word text of the [[Watergate tapes , in a 44-page supplement that hit the streets 24&nbsp;hours after the transcripts' release by the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon  [[White House . Not only was the ''Tribune'' the first newspaper to publish the transcripts, but it beat the US [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office 's  published version, and made headlines doing so.  A week later, after studying the transcripts, the paper's editorial board observed that ""the high dedication to grand principles that Americans have a right to expect from a President is missing from the transcript record."" The ''Tribune''s editors concluded that ""nobody of sound mind can read <nowiki>[the transcripts]</nowiki> and continue to think that Mr. Nixon has upheld the standards and dignity of the Presidency,"" and called for Nixon's resignation. The ''Tribune'' call for Nixon to resign made news, reflecting not only the change in the type of conservatism practiced by the paper, but as a watershed event in terms of Nixon's hopes for survival in office. [[The White House  reportedly perceived the ''Tribune''s editorial as a loss of a long-time supporter and as a blow to Nixon's hopes to weather the scandal.  On December 7, 1975, Kirkpatrick announced in a column on the editorial page that [[Rick Soll , a ""young and talented columnist"" for the paper, whose work had ""won a following among many ''Tribune'' readers over the last two years"", had resigned from the paper. He had acknowledged that a November 23, 1975 column he wrote contained verbatim passages written by another columnist in 1967 and later published in a collection. Kirkpatrick did not identify the columnist. The passages in question, Kirkpatrick wrote, were from a notebook where Soll regularly entered words, phrases and bits of conversation which he had wished to remember. The paper initially suspended Soll for a month without pay. Kirkpatrick wrote that further evidence was revealed came out that another of Soll's columns contained information which he knew was false. At that point, ''Tribune'' editors decided to accept the resignation offered by Soll when the internal investigation began.  After leaving, Soll married [[Pam Zekman , a Chicago newspaper  and future TV  reporter. He worked for the short-lived ''Chicago Times'' magazine in the late 1980s.  In January 1977, ''Tribune'' columnist Will Leonard died at age 64.  In March 1978, the ''Tribune'' announced that it hired columnist [[Bob Greene  from the ''Chicago Sun-Times''.<ref name=CM/>  ===1980s and 1990s=== Kirkpatrick stepped down as editor in 1979 and was succeeded by [[Maxwell McCrohon   1928–2004 , who served as editor until 1981. He was transitioned to a corporate position. McCrohon held the corporate position until 1983, when he left to become editor-in-chief of the [[United Press International . [[James Squires  served as the paper's editor from July 1981 until December 1989.  [[Jack Fuller  served as the ''Tribune''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s editor from 1989 until 1993, when he became the president and chief executive officer of the ''Chicago Tribune''. [[Howard Tyner  served as the ''Tribune''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s editor from 1993 until 2001, when he was promoted to vice president/editorial for Tribune Publishing.  The ''Tribune'' won 11 Pulitzer prizes during the 1980s and 1990s.<ref name=""chicagotribune.com""/> Editorial cartoonist [[Dick Locher  won the award in 1983, and editorial cartoonist [[Jeff MacNelly  won one in 1985. Then, future editor [[Jack Fuller  author |Jack Fuller  won a Pulitzer for editorial writing in 1986. In 1987, reporters Jeff Lyon and Peter Gorner won a Pulitzer for explanatory reporting, and in 1988, [[Dean Baquet , William Gaines and [[Ann Marie Lipinski  won a Pulitzer for investigative reporting. In 1989, [[Lois Wille  won a Pulitzer for editorial writing and [[Clarence Page  snagged the award for commentary. In 1994, [[Ron Kotulak  won a Pulitzer for explanatory journalism, while [[R. Bruce Dold  won it for editorial writing. In 1998, reporter [[Paul Salopek  won a Pulitzer for explanatory writing, and in 1999, architecture critic [[Blair Kamin  won it for criticism.<ref name=""chicagotribune.com""/>  In September 1981, baseball writer [[Jerome Holtzman  was hired by the ''Tribune'' after a 38-year career at the [[Chicago Sun-Times|''Sun-Times'' .  In November 1982, ''Tribune'' managing editor William H. ""Bill"" Jones, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1971, died at age 43 of cardiac arrest as a result of complications from a long battle with [[leukemia .  In May 1983, ''Tribune'' columnist Aaron Gold died at age 45 of complications from [[leukemia . Gold had coauthored the Tribune's ""Inc."" column with [[Michael Sneed  and prior to that had written the paper's ""Tower Ticker"" column.  The ''Tribune'' scored a coup in 1984 when it hired popular columnist [[Mike Royko  away from the rival ''[[Chicago Sun-Times|Sun-Times ''.  In 1986, the ''Tribune'' announced that celebrated film critic [[Gene Siskel , the ''Tribune''s best-known writer, was no longer the paper's film critic, and that his position with the paper had shifted from being that of a full-time film critic to that of a freelance contract writer who was to write about the film industry for the Sunday paper and also provide capsule film reviews for the paper's entertainment sections. The demotion occurred after Siskel and longtime Chicago film critic colleague [[Roger Ebert  decided to shift the production of their weekly movie-review show—then known as ''[[At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert '' and later known as ''[[Siskel & Ebert & The Movies ''—from [[Tribune Entertainment  to [[The Walt Disney Company 's [[Disney–ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television  unit. ""He has done a great job for us,"" editor James Squires said at the time. ""It's a question of how much a person can do physically. We think you need to be a newspaper person first, and Gene Siskel has always tried to do that. But there comes a point when a career is so big that you can't do that."" Siskel declined to comment on the new arrangement, but Ebert publicly criticized Siskel's ''Tribune'' bosses for punishing Siskel for taking their television program to a company other than Tribune Entertainment. Siskel remained in that freelance position until his death in 1999. He was replaced as film critic by [[Dave Kehr .  In February 1988, Tribune foreign correspondent Jonathan Broder resigned after a February 22, 1988 Tribune article written by Broder contained a number of sentences and phrases taken, without attribution, from a column written by another writer, Joel Greenberg, that had been published 10 days earlier in the [[Jerusalem Post .<ref name=""auto""></ref>  In August 1988, ''Chicago Tribune'' reporter Michael Coakley died at age 41 of complications from [[AIDS .  In November 1992, ''Tribune'' associate subject editor Searle ""Ed"" Hawley was arrested by Chicago police and charged with seven counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse for allegedly having sex with three juveniles in his home in [[Evanston, Illinois . Hawley formally resigned from the paper in early 1993, and pleaded guilty in April 1993. He was sentenced to 3&nbsp;years in prison.  In an unusual move at that time, the ''Tribune'' in October 1993 fired its longtime military-affairs writer, retired-Marine David Evans, with the public position that the post of military affairs was being dropped in favor of having a national security writer.  In December 1993, the ''Tribune''s longtime Washington, D.C. bureau chief, [[Nicholas Horrock , was removed from his post after he chose not to attend a meeting that editor [[Howard Tyner  requested of him in Chicago. Horrock, who shortly thereafter left the paper, was replaced by [[James Warren  journalist |James Warren , who attracted new attention to the ''Tribune''s D.C. bureau through his continued attacks on celebrity broadcast journalists in Washington.  Also in December 1993, the ''Tribune'' hired [[Margaret Holt  from the ''[[Sun-Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel '' as its assistant managing editor for sports, making her the first female to head a sports department at any of the nation's 10 largest newspapers. In mid-1995, Holt was replaced as sports editor by Tim Franklin and shifted to a newly created job, customer service editor.  In 1994, reporter [[Brenda You  was fired by the ''Tribune'' after free-lancing for supermarket tabloid newspapers and lending them photographs from the ''Tribune''s photo library.<ref name=CM></ref> You later worked for the ''[[National Enquirer '' and as a producer for ''[[The Jerry Springer Show '' before committing suicide in November 2005.  In April 1994, the ''Tribune''s new television critic, [[Ken Parish Perkins , wrote an article about then-[[WFLD  morning news anchor [[Bob Sirott  in which Perkins quoted Sirott as making a statement that Sirott later denied making. Sirott criticized Perkins on the air, and the ''Tribune'' later printed a correction acknowledging that Sirott had never made that statement. Eight months later, Perkins stepped down as TV critic, and he left the paper shortly thereafter.  In December 1995, the alternative newsweekly ''[[Newcity '' published a first-person article by the pseudonymous Clara Hamon  a name mentioned in the play ''[[The Front Page ''  but quickly identified by ''Tribune'' reporters as that of former ''Tribune'' reporter Mary Hill that heavily criticized the paper's one-year residency program. The program brought young journalists in and out of the paper for one-year stints, seldom resulting in a full-time job. Hill, who wrote for the paper from 1992 until 1993, acknowledged to the ''Chicago Reader'' that she had written the diatribe originally for the Internet, and that the piece eventually was edited for ''Newcity''.  In 1997, the ''Tribune'' celebrated its 150th anniversary in part by tapping longtime reporter [[Stevenson Swanson  to edit the book ''Chicago Days: 150 Defining Moments in the Life of a Great City''.  On April 29, 1997, popular columnist [[Mike Royko  died of a [[brain aneurysm . On September 2, 1997, the ''Tribune'' promoted longtime City Hall reporter [[John Kass  to take Royko's place as the paper's principal Page Two news columnist.  On June 1, 1997, the ''Tribune'' published what ended up becoming a very popular column by [[Mary Schmich  called ""Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young"", otherwise known as ""[[Wear Sunscreen "" or the ""Sunscreen Speech."" The most popular and well-known form of the essay is the successful music single released in 1999, accredited to [[Baz Luhrmann .  In 1998, reporter Jerry Thomas was fired by the ''Tribune'' after he wrote a cover article on boxing promoter [[Don King  boxing promoter |Don King  for ''[[Emerge  magazine |Emerge '' magazine at the same time that he was writing a cover article on King for the ''Chicago Tribune'' Sunday magazine. The paper decided to fire Thomas—and suspend his photographer on the ''Emerge'' story, Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Tribune'' photographer Ovie Carter for a month—because Thomas did not tell the ''Tribune'' about his outside work and also because the ''Emerge'' story wound up appearing in print first.  On June 6, 1999, the ''Tribune'' published a first-person travel article from freelance writer Gaby Plattner that described a supposed incident in which a pilot for [[Air Zimbabwe  who was flying without a copilot inadvertently locked himself out of his cockpit while the plane was flying on [[autopilot  and as a result needed to use a large ax to chop a hole in the cockpit door.<ref name=""ReferenceA""></ref> An airline representative wrote a lengthy letter to the paper calling the account ""totally untrue, unprofessional and damaging to our airline"" and explaining that Air Zimbabwe does not keep axes on its aircraft and never flies without a full crew, and the paper was forced to print a correction stating that Plattner ""now says that she passed along a story she had heard as something she had experienced.""<ref name=""ReferenceA""/>  The ''Tribune'' has been a leader on the Internet, acquiring 10 percent of [[AOL|America Online  in the early 1990s, then launching such web sites as Chicagotribune.com  1995 , [[Metromix .com  1996 , '''ChicagoSports.com'''  1999 , '''ChicagoBreakingNews.com'''  2008 , and '''[[ChicagoNow '''  2009 . In 2002, the paper launched a tabloid edition targeted at 18- to 34-year-olds known as ''[[RedEye ''.  ===2000s=== [[Ann Marie Lipinski  was the paper's editor from February 2001 until stepping down on July 17, 2008. [[Gerould W. Kern  was named the paper's editor in July 2008.<ref name=""nyt2008-07-15""></ref> In early August 2008, managing editor for news [[Hanke Gratteau  resigned, and several weeks later, managing editor for features [[James Warren  journalist |James Warren  resigned as well.<ref name=""chicagoreader1""></ref> Both were replaced by [[Jane Hirt , who previously had been the editor of the ''Tribune''s ''[[RedEye '' tabloid.<ref name=""chicagoreader1""/>  In June 2000, Times Mirror merged with Tribune Company making ''[[The Baltimore Sun '' and its community papers Baltimore Sun Media Group / Patuxent Publishing a subsidiary of Tribune.  In July 2000, Tribune outdoors columnist John Husar, who had written about his need for a new liver transplant, died at age 63 just over a week after receiving part of a new liver from a live donor.  Tribune's Baltimore Community papers include ''Arbutus Times'', ''Baltimore Messenger'', ''Catonsville Times'', ''Columbia Flier'', ''Howard County Times'', ''The Jeffersonian'', ''Laurel Leader'', ''Lifetimes'', ''North County News'', ''Northeast Booster'', ''Northeast Reporter'', ''Owings Mills Times'', and ''Towson Times''.  The ''Howard County Times'' was named 2010 Newspaper of the Year by the Suburban Newspaper Association.  The ''Towson Times'' expands coverage beyond the Towson area and includes Baltimore County government and politics.<ref name=""explorebaltimorecounty""></ref>  The ''Tribune'' won five Pulitzer prizes in the first decade of the 21st century.<ref name=""chicagotribune.com""/> Salopek won his second Pulitzer for the ''Tribune'' in 2001 for international reporting, and that same year an explanatory reporting team—lead writers of which were [[Louise Kiernan , [[Jon Hilkevitch , [[Laurie Cohen , [[Robert Manor , Andrew Martin, [[John Schmeltzer , Alex Rodriguez and [[Andrew Zajac —won the honor for a profile of the chaotic U.S. air traffic system.<ref name=""chicagotribune.com""/> In 2003, editorial writer [[Cornelia Grumman  snagged the award for editorial writing.<ref name=""chicagotribune.com""/> In 2005, [[Julia Keller  won a Pulitzer for feature reporting on a tornado that struck [[Utica, Illinois .<ref name=""chicagotribune.com""/> And, in 2008, an investigative reporting team including [[Patricia Callahan , [[Maurice Possley , [[Sam Roe , Ted Gregory, [[Michael Oneal , [[Evan Osnos  and photojournalist [[Scott Strazzante  won the Pulitzer for its series about faulty government regulation of defective toys, cribs and car seats.<ref name=""chicagotribune.com""/>  In late 2001, sports columnist [[Michael Holley  announced he was leaving the ''Tribune'' after just two months because he was homesick.<ref name=""chireader""></ref> He ultimately returned to the ''[[Boston Globe '', where he had been working immediately before the ''Tribune'' had hired him.<ref name=""chireader""/>  On September 15, 2002, Lipinski wrote a terse, page-one note informing readers that the paper's longtime columnist, [[Bob Greene , resigned effective immediately after acknowledging ""engaging in inappropriate sexual conduct some years ago with a girl in her late teens whom he met in connection with his newspaper column."" The conduct later was revealed to have occurred in 1988 with a woman who was of the age of consent in Illinois. ""Greene's behavior was a serious violation of ''Tribune'' ethics and standards for its journalists,"" Lipinski wrote. ""We deeply regret the conduct, its effect on the young woman and the impact this disclosure has on the trust our readers placed in Greene and this newspaper.""  In January 2003, [[Mike Downey , formerly of the ''[[Los Angeles Times '', was hired as new ''Tribune'' sports columnist. He and colleague Rick Morrissey would write the ''In the Wake of the News Column'' originated by [[Ring Lardner .  In March 2004, the ''Tribune'' announced that freelance reporter [[Uli Schmetzer , who retired from the ''Tribune'' in 2002 after 16&nbsp;years as a foreign correspondent, had fabricated the name and occupation of a person he had quoted in a story. The paper terminated Schmetzer as a contract reporter and began a review of the 300 stories that Schmetzer had written over the prior three years.  In May 2004, the ''Tribune'' revealed that freelance reporter [[Mark Falanga  was unable to verify some facts that he inserted in a lifestyle-related column that ran on April 18, 2004, about an expensive lunch at a Chicago restaurant—namely, that the restaurant charged $15 for a bottle of water and $35 for a pasta entree. ""Upon questioning, the freelance writer indicated the column was based on an amalgam of three restaurants and could not verify the prices,"" the paper noted. After the correction, the ''Tribune'' stopped using Falanga.  In October 2004, ''Tribune'' editor [[Ann Marie Lipinski  at the last minute spiked a story written for the paper's WomanNews section by freelance reporter [[Lisa Bertagnoli  titled ""You c_nt say that  or can you? ,"" about a noted [[vulgarism .<ref name=""chicagoreader.com""></ref> The paper ordered every spare body to go to the ''Tribune''s printing plant to pull already-printed WomanNews sections containing the story from the Wednesday, October 27, 2004, package of preprinted sections in the ''Tribune''.<ref name=""chicagoreader.com""/>  In September 2008, the ''Tribune'' considered hiring controversial sports columnist [[Jay Mariotti , shortly after his abrupt resignation from ''Tribune'' archrival ''[[Chicago Sun-Times ''.<ref name=""archives.chicagotribune.com""></ref> Discussions ultimately ended, however, after the ''Sun-Times'' threatened to sue for violating Mariotti's noncompete agreement, which was to run until August 2009.<ref name=""archives.chicagotribune.com""/> Sports columnist Rick Morrissey defected to the ''Sun-Times'' in December 2009.  In April 2009, 55 Tribune reporters and editors signed their names to an e-mail sent to Kern and managing editor Jane Hirt, questioning why the newspaper's marketing department had solicited subscribers' opinions on stories before they were published, and suggesting that the practice raised ethical questions as well as legal and competitive issues. Reporters declined to speak on the record to the Associated Press about their issues. ""We'll let the e-mail speak for itself,"" reporter John Chase told the AP. In the wake of the controversy, Kern abruptly discontinued the effort, which he described as ""a brief market research project.""<ref name=""sdut30apr2009""></ref>  In the first decade of the 21st century, the ''Tribune'' had multiple rounds of reductions of staff through layoffs and buyouts as it has coped with the industrywide declines in advertising revenues: * In December 2005, the ''Tribune'' eliminated 28 editorial positions through a combination of buyouts and layoffs, including what were believed to be the first layoffs in the paper's history.<ref name=""Rosenthal 1""></ref> Among the reporters who left the paper in that round were Carol Kleiman, Bill Jauss and Connie Lauerman.<ref name=""Rosenthal 1""/> * In June 2007, about 25 newsroom employees took buyouts, including well-known bylines like [[Charles Madigan , Michael Hirsley and Ronald Kotulak, along with noted photographer [[Pete Souza . * In March 2008, the paper gave buyouts to about 25 newsroom employees, including sportswriter [[Sam Smith  sportswriter |Sam Smith . * On August 15, 2008, the ''Tribune'' laid-off more than 40 newsroom and other editorial employees, including reporters Rick Popely, Ray Quintanilla, [[Lew Freedman , Michael Martinez and Robert Manor.<ref name=""blogs.chicagoreader.com""></ref> * Also in August 2008, about 36 editorial employees took voluntary buyouts or resigned, including well-known bylines like Michael Tackett, Ron Silverman, Timothy McNulty, Ed Sherman, Evan Osnos, Steve Franklin, Maurice Possley, Hanke Gratteau, Chuck Osgood and Skip Myslenski.<ref name=""blogs.chicagoreader.com""/> * On November 12, 2008, five editorial employees in the paper's Washington, D.C. bureau were laid off, including [[John Crewdson . * On December 4, 2008, about 11 newsroom employees were laid-off, with one sports columnist, [[Mike Downey , having departed several weeks earlier when his contract was not renewed.

Initially denying the existence of a so-called ""Category I"" admissions program, university President B. Joseph ""Joe"" White and Chancellor Richard Herman later admitted that there were instances of preferential treatment. Although they claimed the list was short and their role was minor, the ''Tribune'', in particular, revealed emails through a FOIA finding that White had received a recommendation for a relative of convicted fundraiser [[Tony Rezko  to be admitted. The Tribune also later posted emails from Herman pushing for underqualified students to be accepted. The ''Tribune'' has since filed suit against the university administration under the [[Freedom of Information Act  United States |Freedom of Information Act  to acquire the names of students benefited by administrative clout and impropriety.  ===2010s=== On February 8, 2010, the ''Chicago Tribune'' shrank its newspaper's width by an inch.

It believes in free markets, free will and freedom of expression. These principles, while traditionally conservative, are guidelines and not reflexive dogmas.  :The ''Tribune'' brings a Midwestern sensibility to public debate. It is suspicious of untested ideas.  :The ''Tribune'' places great emphasis on the integrity of government and the private institutions that play a significant role in society. The newspaper does this in the belief that the people cannot consent to be governed unless they have knowledge of, and faith in, the leaders and operations of government. The ''Tribune'' embraces the diversity of people and perspectives in its community. It is dedicated to the future of the Chicago region.  The ''Tribune'' has remained economically conservative, being widely skeptical of increasing the minimum wage and [[entitlement  spending. Although the ''Tribune'' criticized the Bush administration's record on civil liberties, the environment, and many aspects of its foreign policy, it continued to support his presidency while taking Democrats, such as Illinois Governor [[Rod Blagojevich  and [[Cook County Board President  [[Todd Stroger , to task and calling for their removal from office.  In 2004, the ''Tribune'' endorsed President [[George W. Bush  for re-election, a decision consistent with its longstanding support for the [[Republican Party  United States |Republican Party . In 2008, it endorsed Democratic candidate and Illinois junior U.S. Senator [[Barack Obama —the first time that it had ever endorsed a Democrat for president. The ''Tribune'' endorsed Obama once again for reelection in 2012.  The ''Tribune'' has occasionally backed independent candidates for president. In 1872, it supported [[Horace Greeley , a former Republican Party newspaper editor, and in 1912 the paper endorsed [[Theodore Roosevelt , who ran on the [[Progressive Party  United States, 1912 |Progressive Party  slate against Republican President [[William Howard Taft . In 2016, the Tribune endorsed the [[Libertarian Party  United States |Libertarian Party  candidate, former New Mexico Governor [[Gary Johnson  for president, over Republican [[Donald Trump  and Democrat [[Hillary Clinton .  Over the years, the ''Tribune'' has endorsed some Democrats for lesser offices, including recent endorsements of [[Bill Foster  Illinois politician |Bill Foster , Barack Obama for the [[United States Senate|Senate  and Democrat [[Melissa Bean , who defeated [[Philip Crane , the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives ' longest-serving Republican. Although the ''Tribune'' endorsed [[George Ryan  in the 1998 Illinois gubernatorial race, the paper subsequently investigated and reported on the scandals surrounding Ryan during his preceding years as Secretary of State. Ryan declined to run for re-election in 2002 and was subsequently indicted, convicted and imprisoned as a result of the scandal.  , the ''Chicago Tribune'' and ''[[LA Times '' have taken down their websites in most European countries due to [[GDPR , despite the newspapers having had two years to prepare for it.  ==Tribune Company==  The ''Chicago Tribune'' is the founding business unit of [[Tribune Media|Tribune Company   since renamed ''Tribune Media'' , which included many newspapers and television stations around the country. In Chicago, Tribune Media owns the [[WGN  AM |WGN  radio station  720&nbsp;AM  and [[WGN-TV   Channel 9 . Tribune Company also owned the ''[[Los Angeles Times ''—which displaced the Tribune as the company's largest property—and the [[Chicago Cubs  [[baseball  team. The Cubs were sold in 2009; the newspapers spun off in 2014 as Tribune Publishing and, later, Tronc.  Tribune Company owned the New York ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News '' from its 1919 founding until its 1991 sale to British newspaper magnate [[Robert Maxwell . The founder of the ''News'', Capt. [[Joseph Medill Patterson , was a grandson of Joseph Medill and a cousin of ''Tribune'' editor Robert McCormick. Both Patterson and McCormick were enthusiasts of [[spelling|simplified spelling , another hallmark of their papers for many years. In 2008, the Tribune Company sold the Long Island newspaper ''[[Newsday ''—founded in 1940 by Patterson's daughter  and Medill's great-granddaughter , [[Alicia Patterson —to Long Island cable TV company [[Cablevision .  From 1925 to 2018, the Chicago Tribune was housed in the [[Tribune Tower  on North [[Michigan Avenue  Chicago |Michigan Avenue  on the [[Magnificent Mile . The building is [[Gothic architecture|neo-Gothic  in style, and the design was the winner of an international competition hosted by the Tribune. The Chicago Tribune moved in June 2018 to the Prudential Plaza office complex overlooking Millennium Park after Tribune Media sold Tribune Tower to developers.   ===Columnists===    ====Current==== * Steve Chapman * [[Amy Dickinson  * [[Dahleen Glanton  * [[David Haugh  * [[Rex Huppke  * [[Blair Kamin  * [[John Kass  * [[Ryan Ori  * [[Clarence Page  * [[Michael Phillips  critic |Michael Phillips  * [[Steve Rosenbloom  * [[Mary Schmich  * [[Heidi Stevens  * [[Eric Zorn      ====Past==== * [[William Armstrong  music critic |William Armstrong  * [[Skip Bayless  * [[Claudia Cassidy  * [[Steve Daley  journalist |Steve Daley  * [[Mike Downey  * [[Bob Greene  * [[Vernon Jarrett  * [[Hugh Keough  * [[Ann Landers  * [[Ring Lardner  * [[Charles Madigan  * [[Steve Neal  historian |Steve Neal  * [[Jack Mabley  * [[Mike Royko  * [[Gene Siskel  * [[Arch Ward    ==2008 redesign== The September 2008 redesign  discussed here on the ''Tribune''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s web site  was controversial and is largely regarded as an effort in cost-cutting. Since then the newspaper has returned to a more toned down style. The style is more a mix of the old style and a new modern style.  ==Zell ownership and bankruptcy== In December 2007, the Tribune Company was bought out by Chicago real estate magnate [[Sam Zell  in an $8.2&nbsp;billion deal. Zell was the company's new chairman.<ref name=""APBuyoutCloses20071221""></ref> A year after going private, following a $124&nbsp;million third-quarter loss, the Tribune Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 8, 2008. The company made its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, citing a debt of $13&nbsp;billion and assets of $7.6&nbsp;billion.  Sam Zell originally planned to turn the company into a private company through the creation of an [[Employee stock ownership plan|ESOP   employee stock ownership plan  within the company, but due to poor management that existed prior to his ownership, this did not work out as well as he intended.  As part of its bankruptcy plan, owner Sam Zell intended to sell the Cubs to reduce debt. This sale has become linked to the corruption charges leading to the December 9, 2008, arrest of former Illinois Governor [[Rod Blagojevich . Specifically, the ex-governor was accused of exploiting the paper's financial trouble in an effort to have several editors fired.  In the bankruptcy, unsecured bondholders of Tribune Co. essentially claimed that ordinary Tribune shareholders participated in a ""fraudulent transfer"" of wealth.<ref name=wsj></ref>  The law firm Brown Rudnick, representing the Aurelius group of junior creditors, filed fraudulent transfer claims and fraud claims against 33,000 to 35,000 stockholders who bought Tribune stock.<ref name=""haunt""></ref> Prolonged due to these claims against former officers, directors, and every former stockholder of the Chicago Tribune Company,<ref name=haunt /><ref name=ch11></ref> the Tribune's bankruptcy-related legal and professional fees of $500&nbsp;million were more than twice the usual amount for that size of company.<ref name=""Trib20121231""></ref>  The Tribune Co. emerged from bankruptcy in January 2013, partially owned by private equity firms which had speculated on its distressed debt.

The shares in Tribune Publishing were given tax-free to stakeholders in Tribune Media, the largest shareholder was Oaktree Capital Management with 18.5%.<ref name=""Trib20140612""/> Tribune Media, retaining the non-newspaper broadcasting, entertainment, real estate, and other investments, also sold off some of the non-newspaper properties.<ref name=""Trib20140805""/>  ==Prices== The ''Tribune'' prices are: $1.50 or $1.99/Daily, $3.50 or $3.99/Sunday/Thanksgiving Day.

Founded in 1847, and formerly self-styled as the ""World's Greatest Newspaper""  for which WGN radio and television are named , it remains the most-read daily newspaper of the Chicago metropolitan area and the Great Lakes region. It is the eighth-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation  and became the second-largest under Tribune's ownership after the Chicago Tribune's parent company purchased the Los Angeles Times .Traditionally published as a broadsheet, on January 13, 2009, the Tribune announced it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery, but would publish in tabloid format for newsstand, news box, and commuter station sales. This change, however, proved to be unpopular with readers and in August 2011, the Tribune discontinued the tabloid edition, returning to its traditional broadsheet edition through all distribution channels.The Tribune's masthead is notable for displaying the American flag, in reference to the paper's motto, ""An American Paper for Americans."" The motto is no longer displayed on the masthead, where it was placed below the flag."

Lilley, Goldy, and McInnes have all since left the project. In February 2019, after suing the [[Southern Poverty Law Center  for allegedly damaging his reputation and career prospect by characterizing the Proud Boys as a [[hate group , McInnes announced that he is once again hired by the media group.<ref name=mediaite_2019-02-05></ref>  The Rebel Media fired Faith Goldy for her prominent coverage of the [[2017 Unite the Right rally  in [[Charlottesville, Virginia , and her interview with [[The Daily Stormer .<ref name=""Lett2017""></ref>  A co-founder and two freelancers [[The_Rebel_Media#Blowback_over_coverage_of_the_Unite_the_Right_Rally|resigned in protest of the coverage .<ref name=""cbc.ca""></ref>  The Rebel Media broadcasts its content on the Rebel Media website and its [[YouTube  channel, which previously peaked on 16 August 2017, at 873,800 subscribers, however with the August departures, it had fallen to a minimum of 842,200 as of 31 August. In September–October 2017 the channel resumed its growth. On 15 August 2018, it had over one million subscribers.  The Rebel Media, often cast as Canada's version of [[Breitbart News , has been described as being part of the <!--do NOT change without getting consensus on the talk page-->[[alt-right  movement, although it rejected the term after the Charlottesville rally.  == History == === 2015–2017 === The Rebel Media was formed by Levant and Lilley following the closure of the Sun News Network. Levant said that his online production would be unencumbered by the regulatory and distribution difficulties faced by Sun News Network and that its lower production costs would make it more viable. Levant has cited [[Breitbart News|Breitbart , the American <!--do NOT change without getting consensus on the talk page-->far-right news hub, as an inspiration.<ref name="":2""> National Post|website=nationalpost.com|language=en|access-date=20 March 2018 </ref> A [[crowdfunding  campaign raised roughly [[Canadian dollar|$ 100,000 for the project. The site soon attracted a number of other former Sun News Network personalities such as David Menzies, Paige MacPherson, Faith Goldy, [[Patrick Moore  environmentalist |Patrick Moore  and, briefly, Michael Coren.  In the summer of 2015, the channel, led by Levant, launched a campaign to boycott [[Tim Hortons , a chain of Canadian coffee shops, after it rejected in-store ads from [[Enbridge  due to complaints from customers opposed to the oil pipeline projects being promoted by the ads.  In early 2016, the [[Alberta  government banned The Rebel Media's correspondents from press briefings on the grounds that, because Ezra Levant had testified in court in 2014 that he was a columnist or commentator rather than a reporter, none of his current correspondents could be considered to be journalists. On 17 February 2016, the government admitted that it made a mistake and said that it would allow The Rebel Media correspondents into press briefings. [[The Canadian Association of Journalists  supported preventing government from choosing journalism coverage.""  In late 2016, The Rebel Media advocated for accreditation by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to permit its access as journalists to their event. The Rebel Media had previously published articles claiming that the public [[Climate change denial|is being deceived about climate change .  Rebel Media did receive support from the federal Canadian government and three journalism organizations and eventually was granted access by the UN.  Following the [[Quebec City mosque shooting  on 29 January 2017, Rebel promoted a [[conspiracy theory  that the shooting was perpetrated by Muslims.  In 2017, Rebel Media hired as its British correspondent <!--do NOT change without getting consensus on the talk page-->far-right activist [[Tommy Robinson  activist |Tommy Robinson , founder of the avowedly anti-Islamic [[English Defence League . Robinson was convicted of mortgage fraud and using a friend's passport to enter the US.  In March 2017, one of their correspondents, [[Gavin McInnes , made controversial comments defending [[Holocaust deniers , accused the Jews of being responsible for the [[Holodomor  and the [[Treaty of Versailles , and said he was ""becoming anti-Semitic"".  He later said his comments were taken out of context. McInnes also produced a video for Rebel called ""Ten Things I Hate about Jews"", later retitled ""Ten Things I Hate About Israel"".  During the [[French presidential election, 2017|2017 French Presidential Election , [[Jack Posobiec , The Rebel Media's Washington, D.C. bureau chief, supported far right leader [[Marine Le Pen  and played a role in the [[2017 Macron e-mail leaks .  [[Lauren Southern  left the organization in March 2017.  === Blowback over coverage of the Unite the Right Rally === Co-founder Brian Lilley quit the Rebel on 12 August 2017, following the [[2017 Unite the Right rally  in [[Charlottesville, Virginia , writing, ""What anyone from The Rebel was doing at a so-called 'unite the right' rally that was really an anti-Semitic white power rally is beyond me.

[[Faith Goldy , a former journalist and online show host of the Rebel, was fired on 17 August 2017, for her participation in a podcast associated with The Daily Stormer. In the course of reporting on the [[2017 Unite the Right rally  in Charlottesville, Goldy argued that they suggested a wider ""rising white racial consciousness"" in America and characterizing a manifesto by [[White supremacy|white supremacist  [[Richard B.

Robertson also played audio of Levant offering him thousands of dollars of what Levant himself called ""hush money"".

Scheer replied that he did not ask Mashall about his firm's many clients. Later, a spokesperson clarified that Scheer did not know the specifics of the arrangement. Levant explained that Marshall's IT firm Torch provided client services for the Rebel. A 2017 [[National Post  article argued that Marshall implemented the Rebel donation system.<ref name="":2"" /> Scheer told [[Maclean's  in 2018, that Marshall past relationship with the Rebel  should not be conflated with his selection as campaign chair.

Within a three-month period in 2017, the activist group claimed that the Rebel had lost approximately 300 advertisers, including  [[CCM  ice hockey |CCM Hockey , [[Mountain Equipment Co-op , [[Red Lobster , [[Reitmans , [[Penguin Books  Canada, [[Volkswagen  Canada and [[Tangerine Bank , along with [[PetSmart , the [[Hudson's Bay Company , [[General Motors Canada , the [[Royal Canadian Mint , the [[Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation , [[Ottawa  Tourism, [[Porter Airlines , and [[Whistler Blackcomb  ski resort.  The [[City of Edmonton  withdrew from city advertisements after complaints on social media about the controversial nature of Levant's comments. According to Councilor Oshry, the city would have made this decision regardless of political leanings, because of controversial articles.  Another activist group, [[Hope not Hate , pressured [[Norwegian Cruise Lines  into cancelling a scheduled Caribbean cruise which was to feature talks by The Rebel Media personalities, many of whom have since left the media website.<ref name=""goldypost"" />  ===  Rebel Freedom Fund  === In December 2017 Wells Asset Management announced the Rebel Freedom Fund, allowing investors to fund Levant's film and video projects, offering an expected 4.5% return.<ref name=""rff""></ref> This attracted news coverage the following February in advance of the fund's ostensible 1 March opening date, generally negative; ''[[MoneySense '', for example, stated that ""This one carries a lot of risk and doesn’t clear the ''MoneySense'' bar for appropriate retirement investment risk, whatever the political orientation.""<ref name=""MS.rebel""></ref> In June, however, Wells announced that it was shutting down all its funds, and when queried by a reporter from ''[[Maclean's '', stated that the Rebel Freedom Fund had never launched.  == Notable contributors == <!-- Wikipedia is not a directory.

The new daily was housed in the dilapidated one-story Star Building on 13th and Railroad streets in Port Area, Manila. It was put out by 40 editors, reporters, correspondents, photographers and other editorial employees working in a 100 square meter newsroom. Columnist [[Louie Beltran  was named its [[editor-in-chief .  The newspaper was instrumental then in documenting the campaign of [[Corazón Aquino  during the [[Philippine presidential election, 1986|1986 presidential elections  and, in turn, the [[People Power Revolution|1986 People Power Revolution . Its slogan, ''Balanced News, Fearless Views'', was incorporated to the newspaper in January 1986 after a slogan-making contest held during the first month of the ''Inquirer's'' existence.<ref name=PDI/>  On July 1986, questions about finances and a divergence of priorities caused a rift among the founders which led Belmonte, Soliven, and Art Borjal's split from the Inquirer to establish ''[[The Philippine STAR ''.<ref name=Beginnings></ref> As Belmonte owned the Star Building where the Inquirer was headquartered, the newspaper amicably transferred to the Soliven-owned BF Condominium in Aduana Street, [[Intramuros .<ref name=""Beginnings""/>  ===Pascual years  1989–91 === In February 1987, Federico D.

According to one former editor, Bill Emmott, ""the ''Economist''s philosophy has always been liberal, not conservative"". Individual contributors take diverse views. ''The Economist'' favours the support, through [[central bank s, of banks and other important corporations. This principle can, in a much more limited form, be traced back to [[Walter Bagehot , the third editor of ''The Economist'', who argued that the Bank of England should support major banks that got into difficulties. [[Karl Marx  deemed ''The Economist'' the ""European organ"" of ""the aristocracy of finance"".  The news magazine has also supported liberal causes on social issues such as recognition of gay marriages, legalisation of drugs, criticises the [[Taxation in the United States|US tax model , and seems to support some government regulation on health issues, such as smoking in public, as well as bans on spanking children.  ''The Economist'' consistently favours guest worker programmes, parental choice of school, and amnesties and once published an ""obituary"" of God. ''The Economist'' also has a long record of supporting gun control.  ''The Economist'' has endorsed the [[Labour Party  UK |Labour Party   in 2005  the [[Conservative Party  UK |Conservative Party   in 2010 and 2015 ,<ref name=""The Economist""></ref> and the [[Liberal Democrats  UK |Liberal Democrats   in 2017  at general election time in Britain, and both [[Republican Party  United States |Republican  and [[Democratic Party  United States |Democratic  candidates in the United States. ''Economist.com'' puts its stance this way:  </ref>   ''The Economist'' frequently accuses figures and countries of corruption or dishonesty. In recent years, for example, it criticised [[Paul Wolfowitz , [[World Bank  president; [[Silvio Berlusconi , Italy's Prime Minister  who dubbed it ''The Ecommunist'' ; [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila , the late president of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo ; [[Robert Mugabe , the former head of government in [[Zimbabwe ; and, recently, [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , the president of Argentina. ''The Economist'' also called for [[impeachment of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's impeachment  and, after the emergence of the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse , for [[Donald Rumsfeld 's resignation. Though ''The Economist'' initially gave vigorous support for the [[Iraq War|US-led invasion of Iraq , it later called the operation ""bungled from the start"" and criticised the ""almost criminal negligence"" of the Bush Administration's handling of the war, while maintaining, in 2007, that pulling out in the short term would be irresponsible. In the 2004 US election, the editors ""reluctantly"" backed John Kerry. In the 2008 US election ''The Economist'' endorsed [[Barack Obama , while using the front cover of the issue published on the eve of the election to promote his candidacy.  In the 2012 US election, Barack Obama was again endorsed: the editorial said that they preferred Obama on the economy, foreign policy and health care, but criticised him for running a negative campaign against Romney and for a ""...poor appreciation of commerce.""  In an editorial marking its 175th anniversary, ''The Economist'' criticised adherents to liberalism from becoming too inclined to protect the political status quo rather than pursue reform.<ref name=""The Economist at 175""></ref> The paper called on liberals to return to advocating for bold political, economic and social reforms: protecting [[free market s, land and tax reform in the tradition of [[Georgism , [[open immigration , a rethink of the [[social contract  with more emphasis on education, and a revival of [[liberal internationalism .<ref name=""The Economist at 175"" />  ==Tone and voice== Though it has many individual columns, by tradition and current practice the magazine ensures a uniform voice—aided by the anonymity of writers—throughout its pages, as if most articles were written by a single author, which may be perceived to display dry, understated wit, and precise use of language. ''The Economist'' has traditionally—albeit not always consistently—persisted in referring to itself as a ""newspaper"", rather than a newsmagazine, due to the gradual pace of its transformation in format from [[newsprint  to glossy colour  articles were printed on the front page into the 1950s  in addition to its general focus on current affairs as opposed to specialist subjects.<ref name=""pgazette"" />  ''The Economist''s treatment of economics presumes a working familiarity with fundamental concepts of classical economics. For instance, it does not explain terms like [[invisible hand , [[macroeconomics , or [[demand curve , and may take just six or seven words to explain the theory of [[comparative advantage . Articles involving economics do not presume any formal training on the part of the reader and aim to be accessible to the educated layman. It usually does not translate short French  and German  quotes or phrases. It does describe the business or nature of even well-known entities, writing, for example, ""Goldman Sachs, an investment bank"".  Many articles include some witticism; image captions are often humorous puns and the letters section usually concludes with an odd or light-hearted letter. These efforts at humour have sometimes had a mixed reception. For example, the cover of the 20 September 2003 issue, headlined by a story on the [[World Trade Organization|WTO  ministerial meeting in Cancún, featured a cactus [[Finger  gesture |giving the middle finger . Readers sent both positive and negative letters in response.  ===Editorial anonymity=== Articles often take a definite editorial stance and almost never carry a [[byline . Not even the name of the editor  since 2015, [[Zanny Minton Beddoes   is printed in the issue. It is a long-standing tradition that an editor's only signed article during their tenure is written on the occasion of their departure from the position. The author of a piece is named in certain circumstances: when notable persons are invited to contribute opinion pieces; when journalists of ''The Economist'' compile special reports  previously known as surveys ; for the Year in Review special edition; and to highlight a potential [[conflict of interest  over a book review. The names of ''The Economist'' editors and correspondents can be located on the media directory pages of the website. Online blog pieces are signed with the initials of the writer and authors of print stories are allowed to note their authorship from their personal web sites. ""This approach is not without its faults  we have four staff members with the initials ""J.P."", for example  but is the best compromise between total anonymity and full bylines, in our view"", wrote one anonymous writer of The Economist.  The editors say this is necessary because ""collective voice and personality matter more than the identities of individual journalists"" and reflects ""a collaborative effort"". In most articles, authors refer to themselves as ""your correspondent"" or ""this reviewer"". The writers of the titled opinion columns tend to refer to themselves by the title  hence, a sentence in the ""Lexington"" column might read ""Lexington was informed..."" .  The American author [[Michael Lewis  author |Michael Lewis  has criticised the magazine's editorial anonymity, labeling it a means to hide the youth and inexperience of those writing articles. In 1991 Lewis quipped: ""The magazine is written by young people pretending to be old people ... If American readers got a look at the pimply complexions of their economic gurus, they would cancel their subscriptions in droves"".<ref name=""fallows""></ref> Although individual articles are written anonymously, there is no secrecy over who the writers are as they are listed on ''The Economist'' website, which also provides summaries of their careers and academic qualifications.  [[John Ralston Saul  describes ''The Economist'' as a ""...magazine which hides the names of the journalists who write its articles in order to create the illusion that they dispense disinterested truth rather than opinion. This sales technique, reminiscent of pre-Reformation Catholicism, is not surprising in a publication named after the social science most given to wild guesses and imaginary facts presented in the guise of inevitability and exactitude. That it is the Bible of the corporate executive indicates to what extent received wisdom is the daily bread of a managerial civilization.""  ==Circulation== Each of ''The Economist'' issue's official date range is from Saturday to the following Friday. ''The Economist'' posts each week's new content online at approximately 2100 Thursday evening UK time, ahead of the official publication date.  In 1877, the publication's circulation was 3,700, and in 1920 it had risen to 6,000. Circulation increased rapidly after 1945, reaching 100,000 by 1970.<ref name=""About us"" />  Circulation is audited by the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations  UK |Audit Bureau of Circulations   ABC . From around 30,000 in 1960 it has risen to near 1 million by 2000 and by 2016 to about 1.3 million. Sales inside North America were in 2007 around 54 per cent of the total, with sales in the UK making up 14 per cent of the total and continental Europe 19 per cent. ''The Economist'' claims sales, both by subscription and at newsagents, in over 200 countries. Of its American readers, two out of three earn more than $100,000 a year.<ref name=""gainsreaders""></ref>  ''The Economist'' once boasted about its limited circulation. In the early 1990s it used the slogan ""''The Economist'' – not read by millions of people"". ""Never in the history of journalism has so much been read for so long by so few,"" wrote [[Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther|Geoffrey Crowther , a former editor.  The Economist Newspaper Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[The Economist Group . The publications of the group include the ''CFO'' brand family as well as the annual ''The World in...'', the lifestyle bimonthly ''[[1843  magazine |1843 '', ''[[European Voice '', and ''[[Roll Call ''. Sir [[Evelyn Robert de Rothschild  was Chairman of the company from 1972 to 1989.  ==Letters== ''The Economist'' frequently receives letters from senior businesspeople, politicians, ambassadors, and from spokespeople for various government departments, non-governmental organisations and lobbies. Well-written or witty responses from anyone are considered, and controversial issues frequently produce a torrent of letters. For example, the survey of [[corporate social responsibility , published January 2005, produced largely critical letters from [[Oxfam , the [[World Food Programme , [[United Nations Global Compact , the Chairman of [[BT Group , an ex-Director of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell  and the UK [[Institute of Directors .  Many of the letters published are critical of its stance or commentary. After ''The Economist'' ran a critique of [[Amnesty International  and human rights in general in its issue dated 24 March 2007, its letters page ran a vibrant reply from Amnesty, as well as several other letters in support of the organisation, including one from the head of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights . Rebuttals from officials within regimes such as the Singapore government are routinely printed, to comply with local [[right-of-reply  laws without compromising editorial independence.  It is extremely rare for any comment by ''The Economist'' to appear alongside any published letter. Letters published in the news magazine are typically between 150 and 200 words long  and began with the salutation ""Sir"" until the editorship of Zanny Minton Beddoes, the first female editor; they now have no salutation . Previous to a change in procedure, all responses to on-line articles were usually published in ""The Inbox"". Comments can now be made directly under each article.  ==Features== [[File:Big Mac index 50USD 2columns.png|thumb|Visualisation of the [[Big Mac Index  in January 2012  ''The Economist''s primary focus is world events, politics and business, but it also runs regular sections on science and technology as well as books and the arts. Approximately every two weeks, the publication includes an in-depth special report  previously called [[survey article|surveys   on a given topic. The five main categories are Countries and Regions, Business, Finance and Economics, Science and Technology, and Other. Every three months, it publishes a technology report called ''Technology Quarterly'' or TQ, a special section focusing on recent trends and developments in science and technology.  Since July 2007, there has also been a complete audio edition of the news magazine available 9pm London time on Thursdays. The audio version of ''The Economist'' is produced by the production company [[Talking Issues . The company records the full text of the news magazine in mp3 format, including the extra pages in the UK edition. The weekly 130 MB download is free for subscribers and available for a fee for non-subscribers.  The publication's writers adopt a tight style that seeks to include the maximum amount of information in a limited space. [[David G. Bradley , publisher of ''[[The Atlantic '', described the formula as ""a consistent world view expressed, consistently, in tight and engaging prose"".  There is a section of [[economic statistics . Tables such as employment statistics are published each week and there are special statistical features too. It is unique among British weeklies in providing authoritative coverage of official statistics and its rankings of international statistics have been decisive.  In addition, ''The Economist'' is known for its [[Big Mac Index , which it first published in 1986, which uses the price of the hamburger in different countries as an informal measure of the [[purchasing power parity|purchasing power  of currencies.  The publication runs several opinion columns whose names reflect their topic: * ''Analects''  China  – named after [[The Analects , a collection of [[Confucius|Confucian  sayings, this column was established in February 2012, and was later discontinued in November 2014 and replaced by online China coverage. * ''Babbage''  Technology  – named for the inventor [[Charles Babbage , this column was established in March 2010 and focuses on various technology related issues. * ''Bagehot''  Britain  – named for [[Walter Bagehot  , 19th-century British constitutional expert and early editor of ''The Economist''. From July 2010 until June 2012 it was written by [[David Rennie  columnist |David Rennie . Since April 2017 it has been written by [[Adrian Wooldridge . * ''Banyan''  Asia  – named for the [[banyan  tree, this column was established in April 2009 and focuses on various issues across the Asian continent, and is written by [[Dominic Ziegler . * ''Baobab''  Africa & Middle East  – named for the [[baobab  tree, this column was established in July 2010 and focuses on various issues across the African continent. * ''Bartleby''  Work and management  - named after [[Bartleby|the titular character  of a [[Herman Melville  short story, this column was established in May 2018. * ''Bello''  Latin America  – named for [[Andrés Bello , a Venezuelan diplomat, poet, legislator and philosopher, who lived and worked in Chile. The column was established in January 2014 and is written by [[Michael Reid  journalist and writer |Michael Reid . * ''Buttonwood''  Finance  – named for the [[Platanus occidentalis|buttonwood  tree where early [[Wall Street  traders gathered. Until September 2006 this was available only as an on-line column, but it is now included in the print edition.  It is written by [[Philip Coggan . * ''Chaguan''  China  – named for Chaguan, the traditional Chinese Tea houses in [[Chengdu , this column was established on September 13, 2018. * ''Charlemagne''  Europe  – named for [[Charlemagne , Emperor of the [[Francia|Frankish Empire . It is written by Jeremy Cliffe and earlier it was written by David Rennie  2007–2010  and by Anton La Guardia  2010–2014 . * ''Erasmus''  Religion and public policy  - named after the Dutch [[Christian humanist  [[Erasmus . * ''Game Theory''  Sport  – named after [[Game theory|the science of predicting outcomes in a certain situation , this column focuses on ""sports major and minor"" and ""the politics, economics, science and statistics of the games we play and watch"". * ''Johnson''  language  – named for [[Samuel Johnson , this column returned to the publication in 2016 and covers language.

From June 2010 until May 2012 it was written by [[Peter David  journalist |Peter David , until his death in a car accident. * ''[[Prospero ''  Books and arts  – named after the character from [[William Shakespeare's  play ''[[The Tempest '', this column reviews books and focuses on arts-related issues. * ''Schumpeter''  Business  – named for the economist [[Joseph Schumpeter , this column was established in September 2009 and is written by Patrick Foulis.  Other regular features include: * ''Face Value'', about prominent people in the business world * ''Free Exchange'', a general economics column, frequently based on academic research, replaced the column ''Economics Focus'' in January 2012 * An obituary. Since 1997 it has been written by [[Ann Wroe . * sections on science and the arts  The news magazine goes to press on Thursdays, between 6pm and 7pm GMT, and is available at [[newsagent s in many countries the next day. It is printed at seven sites around the world. Known on their website as ""This week's print edition"", it is available online, albeit with only the first five viewed articles being free  and available to subscribers only mid-October 2009 – 2010 .  ''The Economist'' published in 2015 its first US college rankings, focused on comparable economical advantages defined as 'the economic value of a university is equal to the gap between how much its students subsequently earn, and how much they might have made had they studied elsewhere'. Based on set of strict criteria sourced from US Department of Education  ""College Scorecard""  with relevant 'expected earnings' and multiple statistics applied in calculation of 'median earnings' conclusive evaluation method has been applied to run the scorecard's earnings data through a multiple regression analysis, a common method of measuring the relationships between variables.  ''The Economist'' also produces the annual ''The World in'' [''Year''] publication. It also sponsors a writing award.  ==''The Economist'' Awards== ===Innovation Awards=== [[File:Economist innovation awards logo.png|thumb|Innovation Awards logo  ''The Economist'' sponsors the yearly ""Economist Innovation Awards"", in the categories of bioscience, computing and communications, energy and the environment, social and economic innovation, business-process innovation, consumer products, and a special ""no boundaries"" category. The awards have been held since 2002. Nominations are held between 2 and 30 April. The award ceremony is then hosted on 15 November. Choices are based on the following factors: * How much revenue their innovation has made their company or its economic impact on a specific good cause or society in general * The effect their work has had on the marketplace  or if it's created a whole new marketplace altogether  * The impact their innovation has had on a new type of science or technology  ===Writing prize=== In 1999, ''The Economist'' organized a global futurist writing competition, [[The World in 2050 . Co-sponsored by [[Royal Dutch/Shell , the competition included a first prize of [[United States dollar|US$ 20,000 and publication in ''The Economist''s annual flagship publication, ''The World In''.<ref name=""newstraightstimes2000""></ref> Over 3,000 entries from around the world were submitted via a website set up for the purpose and at various Royal Dutch Shell offices worldwide.<ref name=""newstraightstimes2000""/>  The judging panel included [[Bill Emmott ,<ref name=""newstraightstimes2000""/> [[Esther Dyson , Sir [[Mark Moody-Stuart   then-chairman of [[Royal Dutch Shell  ,<ref name=""newstraightstimes2000""/> and [[Matt Ridley   a British scientist and member of the [[House of Lords  .  ==Censorship== Sections of ''The Economist'' criticising authoritarian regimes are frequently removed from the magazine by the authorities in those countries. ''The Economist'' regularly has difficulties with the ruling party of [[Singapore , the [[People's Action Party , which had successfully sued it, in a Singaporean court, for [[Defamation|libel .  Like many other publications, ''The Economist'' is subjected to censorship in [[India  whenever it depicts a map of [[Kashmir . The maps are stamped by Indian Customs officials as being ""neither correct, nor authentic"". Issues are sometimes delayed, but not stopped or seized.  On 15 June 2006, [[Iran  banned the sale of ''The Economist'' when it published a map labelling the [[Persian Gulf  simply as Gulf—a choice that derives its political significance from the [[Persian Gulf naming dispute .  In a separate incident, the government of [[Zimbabwe  went further and imprisoned ''The Economist''s correspondent there, [[Andrew Meldrum . The government charged him with violating a statute on ""publishing untruth"" for writing that a woman was decapitated by supporters of the ruling [[Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front  party. The [[decapitation  claim was retracted and allegedly fabricated by the woman's husband. The correspondent was later acquitted, only to receive a [[deportation  order.  On 19 August 2013, ''The Economist'' disclosed that the Missouri Department of Corrections had censored its issue of 29 June 2013. According to the letter sent by the department, prisoners were not allowed to receive the issue because ""1. it constitutes a threat to the security or discipline of the institution; 2. may facilitate or encourage criminal activity; or 3. may interfere with the rehabilitation of an offender"".  ==Criticism, accusation and praise== In 1991, [[James Fallows  argued in ''[[The Washington Post '' that ''The Economist'' used editorial lines that contradicted the news stories they purported to highlight.<ref name=""fallows"" /> In 1999, [[Andrew Sullivan  complained in ''[[The New Republic '' that it uses ""marketing genius"" to make up for deficiencies in analysis and original reporting, resulting in ""a kind of ''[[Reader's Digest ''""<ref name=""autogenerated1""></ref> for America's corporate elite. Although he acknowledged that the magazine's claim about the dotcom bubble bursting would probably be accurate in the long run  the bubble burst in the US market two years later , Sullivan pointed out that the magazine greatly exaggerated the danger the US economy was in after the Dow Jones fell to 7,400 during the 1998 Labor Day weekend. He also said that ''The Economist'' is editorially constrained because so many scribes graduated from the same college at [[Oxford University , [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College .<ref name=""autogenerated1"" /> ''[[The Guardian '' wrote that ""its writers rarely see a political or economic problem that cannot be solved by the trusted three-card trick of privatisation, deregulation and liberalisation"".<ref name=""autogenerated2""></ref>  In 2008, [[Jon Meacham , former editor of ''Newsweek'' and a self-described ""fan"", criticised ''The Economist'' focus on analysis over original reporting.  In 2012, ''The Economist'' was [[2012 ICT Skype controversy|accused  of hacking into the computer of Justice [[Mohammed Nizamul Huq  of the Bangladesh Supreme Court, leading to his resignation as the chairman of the [[International Crimes Tribunal  Bangladesh |International Crimes Tribunal .<ref name=ICTleaks></ref><ref name=ICTleaks1></ref><ref name=ICTleaks2></ref><ref name=ICTleaks3></ref><ref name=ICTleaks4></ref><ref name=ICTleaks5></ref> The magazine denied the accusations.  In 2014, the magazine withdrew a harshly-criticised review of a book by [[Edward E. Baptist|Edward Baptist  on slavery and American capitalism. ''The Economist'' had complained that ""[a]lmost all the blacks in his book are victims, almost all the whites villains"". Baptist attributed the harsh review to the magazine's adherence to ""[[Market fundamentalism|free-market fundamentalist "" theories, ""the idea that everything would be better if measured first and last by its efficiency at producing profit"".  In 2019, the magazine published an article that called [[Ben Shapiro  an ""alt-right sage,"" before apologizing and changing the accusation to ""radical conservative"" on the same day as the original piece.    ===Praise and accolades=== In 2005, the ''[[Chicago Tribune '' named it the best English-language magazine noting its strength in international reporting ""where it does not feel moved to cover a faraway land only at a time of unmitigated disaster"" and that it kept a wall between its reporting and its more conservative editorial policies.  ==Notes==   ==References==   ==Further reading== * Edwards, Ruth Dudley  1993 , ''The Pursuit of Reason: The Economist 1843–1993'', London: Hamish Hamilton,  *  * Arrese, Angel  1995 , ''La identidad de The Economist,'' Pamplona: Eunsa. .

Continuous publication began under its founder James Wilson in September 1843. In 2015, its average weekly circulation was a little over 1.5 million, about half of which were sold in the United States. Pearson PLC held a 50% shareholding via The Financial Times Limited until August 2015. At that time, Pearson sold their share in the Economist. The Agnelli family's Exor paid £287m to raise their stake from 4.7% to 43.4% while the Economist paid £182m for the balance of 5.04m shares which will be distributed to current shareholders. Aside from the Agnelli family, smaller shareholders in the company include Cadbury, Rothschild  21% , Schroder, Layton and other family interests as well as a number of staff and former staff shareholders.A board of trustees formally appoints the editor, who cannot be removed without its permission. Although The Economist has a global emphasis and scope, about two-thirds of the 75 staff journalists are based in the London borough of Westminster. For the year to March 2016, the Economist Group declared operating profit of £61m.The Economist takes an editorial stance of classical and economic liberalism that supports free trade, globalisation, free immigration and cultural liberalism  such as supporting legal recognition for same-sex marriage or drug liberalisation . The publication has described itself as ""a product of the Caledonian liberalism of Adam Smith and David Hume"". It targets highly educated, cultured readers and claims an audience containing many influential executives and policy-makers. The publication's CEO described this recent global change, which was first noticed in the 1990s and accelerated in the beginning of the 21st century as a ""new age of Mass Intelligence""."

Founded in 1914 by leaders of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement , it attempted to find a balance between a humanitarian progressivism and an intellectual scientism, ultimately discarding the latter. Through the 1980s and '90s, the magazine incorporated elements of ""[[Third Way "" [[neoliberalism  and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism .  In 2014, two years after [[Chris Hughes , a co-founder of [[Facebook , purchased the magazine, he ousted its editor and attempted to remake its format, operations and partisan stances, provoking the resignation of the majority of its editors and writers. In early 2016, Hughes announced he was putting the magazine up for sale, indicating the need for ""new vision and leadership"". It was sold in February 2016 to [[Win McCormack .<ref name="":0""></ref>  ==Political views== Domestically, ''The New Republic'' as of 2011 supported a largely [[modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberal  stance on fiscal and social issues, according to former editor [[Franklin Foer , who stated that it ""invented the modern usage of the term '[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal ', and it's one of our historical legacies and obligations to be involved in the ongoing debate over what exactly liberalism means and stands for.""<ref name=""Seelye""></ref> As of 2004, however, some, like Anne Kossedd and Steven Rendall, contended that it was not as liberal as it had been before 1974.<ref name=""Kosseff""></ref>  The magazine's outlook was formerly associated with the [[Democratic Leadership Council  and ""[[New Democrats "" such as former US President [[Bill Clinton  and Connecticut Senator [[Joseph Lieberman , who received the magazine's endorsement in the [[Democratic Party  United States  presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic primary . The magazine endorsed [[Barack Obama  in the 2008 general election.<ref name=""The New Republic""></ref> Prior to 2014, while defending federal programs like Medicare and the EPA, it advocated some policies that, while seeking to achieve the ends of traditional social welfare programs, often used market solutions as their means, and so were often called ""business-friendly"". Typical of some of the policies supported by both ''The New Republic'' and the DLC during the 1990s were increased funding for the [[Earned Income Tax Credit  program and reform of the Federal welfare system, and [[supply-side economics , especially the idea of reducing higher [[marginal income tax rate s, which received heavy criticism from senior editor [[Jonathan Chait .<ref name=""Chait""></ref> In its current incarnation, ''The New Republic'' is strongly in favor of [[universal health care . On certain high-profile social issues, such as its support of [[same-sex marriage , ''The New Republic'' could be considered more [[Progressivism|progressive  than the mainstream of the Democratic Party establishment. In its March 2007 issue, ''The New Republic'' ran an article by [[Paul Starr   co-founder of the magazine's main rival, ''[[The American Prospect ''  where he provided a definition of modern democratic liberalism:  <blockquote>Liberalism wagers that a state... can be strong but constrained – strong because constrained... Rights to education and other requirements for human development and security aim to advance equal opportunity and personal dignity and to promote a creative and productive society. To guarantee those rights, liberals have supported a wider social and economic role for the state, counterbalanced by more robust guarantees of civil liberties and a wider social system of checks and balances anchored in an independent press and pluralistic society.</blockquote>  ''The New Republic'' does not focus solely on domestic policy, as it also brings analysis and commentary of various international affairs. Support for [[Israel  was a strong theme in ''The New Republic'' under [[Martin Peretz , the former owner of ''The New Republic'': ""Support for Israel is deep down an expression of America's best view of itself.""<ref name=""ea""></ref> According to journalism professor [[Eric Alterman :  <blockquote>Nothing has been as consistent about the past 34 years of ''The New Republic'' as the magazine's devotion to Peretz's own understanding of what is good for Israel... It is really not too much to say that almost all of Peretz's political beliefs are subordinate to his commitment to Israel's best interests, and these interests as Peretz defines them almost always involve more war.<ref name=""ea"" /></blockquote>  Unsigned editorials prior to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq  expressed strong support for military action, citing the threat of [[weapons of mass destruction  as well as humanitarian concerns. Since the end of major military operations, unsigned editorials, while critical of the handling of the war, have continued to justify the invasion on humanitarian grounds, but no longer maintain that Iraq's WMD facilities posed any threat to the United States. In the November 27, 2006 issue, the editors wrote:  <blockquote>At this point, it seems almost beside the point to say this: ''The New Republic'' deeply regrets its early support for this war. The past three years have complicated our idealism and reminded us of the limits of American power and our own wisdom.</blockquote>  On June 23, 2006, in response to criticism of the magazine from the blog [[Daily Kos , [[Marty Peretz|Martin Peretz  wrote the following as a summary of ''The New Republic''s stances on then-recent issues:    The magazine has also published two articles concerning income inequality, largely criticizing conservative economists for their attempts to deny the existence or negative effect increasing income inequality is having on the United States. In its May 2007 issue the magazine ran an editorial pointing to the humanitarian beliefs of liberals as being responsible for the recent plight of the American left. In another article ''The New Republic'' favorably cited the example of [[Denmark  as evidence that an expansive [[welfare state  and high tax burden can be consistent with, and in some ways contribute to, a strong economy. Such editorials and articles exemplify the liberal political orientation of ''The New Republic''.  ==History==  ===Early years=== ''The New Republic'' was founded by [[Herbert Croly , [[Walter Lippmann , and [[Walter Weyl  through the financial backing of heiress [[Dorothy Payne Whitney  and her husband, [[Willard Straight , who maintained majority ownership. The magazine's first issue was published on November 7, 1914. The magazine's politics were [[liberalism in the United States|liberal  and [[Progressive Movement|progressive , and as such concerned with coping with the great changes brought about by middle-class reform efforts designed to remedy the weaknesses in America's changing economy and society. The magazine is widely considered important in changing the character of liberalism in the direction of governmental interventionism, both foreign and domestic. Amongst the most important of these was the emergence of the U.S. as a [[great power  on the international scene. In 1917, ''TNR'' urged America's entry into [[World War I|the Great War  on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies .  One consequence of World War I was the [[Russian Revolution of 1917 . During the inter-war years, the magazine was generally positive in its assessment of the [[Soviet Union  and [[Joseph Stalin . However, the magazine changed its position after the [[Cold War  began in 1947, and in 1948 its leftist editor, [[Henry A. Wallace , departed to run for president on the [[Progressive Party  United States, 1948 |Progressive  ticket. After Wallace, ''TNR'' moved toward positions more typical of mainstream American liberalism. Throughout the 1950s, the publication was critical of both Soviet foreign policy and domestic [[anti-communism , particularly [[McCarthyism . During the 1960s, the magazine opposed the [[Vietnam War , but was also often critical of the [[New Left .  Up until the late 1960s, the magazine had a certain ""cachet as the voice of re-invigorated liberalism"", in the opinion of commentator Eric Alterman. He has criticized the magazine's politics from the left. That cachet, Alterman wrote, ""was perhaps best illustrated when the dashing, young President Kennedy had been photographed boarding Air Force One holding a copy"".<ref name=ea/>  ===Peretz ownership and eventual editorship, 1974–1979=== In March 1974, the magazine was purchased for $380,000<ref name=ea/> by [[Martin Peretz , a lecturer at Harvard University. from Gilbert Harrison.<ref name=ea/> Peretz was a veteran of the [[New Left  who had broken with that movement over its support of various [[Third World  liberationist movements, particularly the [[Palestine Liberation Organization . Peretz transformed ''TNR'' into close to its current form. Under his ownership, ''TNR'' has advocated both strong U.S. support for the [[Israel i government and a [[war hawk|hawkish  U.S. foreign policy.<ref name=ea/> On domestic policy, it has advocated a self-critical brand of liberalism, taking positions that range from traditionally liberal to [[neoliberalism . It has generally supported [[Democratic Party  United States |Democratic  candidates for president, although in 1980 it endorsed the moderate Republican [[John B. Anderson , running as an independent, rather than the Democratic incumbent [[Jimmy Carter .  Harrison continued editing the magazine, expecting Peretz to let him continue running the magazine for three years. But by 1975, when Peretz became annoyed at having his own articles rejected for publication while he was pouring money into the magazine to cover its losses, he fired Harrison. Much of the staff, including [[Walter Pincus , [[Stanley Karnow , and [[Doris Grumbach , was either fired or quit, being replaced largely by recent Harvard graduates lacking in journalistic experience. Peretz became the editor and served in that post until 1979. As other editors have been appointed, Peretz has remained editor-in-chief.<ref name=ea/>  ===Kinsley and Hertzberg editorships, 1979–1991=== [[Michael Kinsley , a [[neoliberal   in the American sense of the term , was editor  1979–1981; 1985–1989 , alternating twice with [[Hendrik Hertzberg   1981–1985; 1989–1991 , who has been called ""an old-fashioned social democrat"". Kinsley was 28 years old when he first became editor, and was still in law school.<ref name=ea/>  Writers for the magazine during this era included neoliberals [[Mickey Kaus  and [[Jacob Weisberg  along with [[Charles Krauthammer , [[Fred Barnes  journalist |Fred Barnes , [[Morton Kondracke , [[Sidney Blumenthal , [[Robert Kuttner , [[Ronald Steel , [[Michael Walzer , and [[Irving Howe .<ref name=ea/>  During the 1980s the magazine generally supported President [[Ronald Reagan 's anti-Communist foreign policy, including provision of aid to the Nicaraguan [[Contras . It has also supported both [[Gulf War s and, reflecting its belief in the moral efficacy of American power, intervention in ""humanitarian"" crises, such as those in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina  and [[Kosovo  during the [[Yugoslav wars .  The magazine became known for its originality and unpredictability in the 1980s. It was widely considered a ""must read"" across the political spectrum. An article in ''Vanity Fair'' judged ''TNR'' ""the smartest, most impudent weekly in the country,"" and the ""most entertaining and intellectually agile magazine in the country."" According to Alterman, the magazine's prose could sparkle and the contrasting views within its pages were ""genuinely exciting"". He added, ""The magazine unarguably set the terms of debate for insider political elites during the Reagan era.""<ref name=ea/>  With the less predictable opinions, more of them leaning conservative than before, the magazine won the respect of many conservative opinion leaders. Twenty copies were sent by messenger to the Reagan White House each Thursday afternoon. [[Norman Podhoretz  called the magazine ""indispensable"", and [[George Will  said it was ""currently the nation's most interesting and most important political journal."" ''[[National Review '' described it as ""one of the most interesting magazines in the United States.""<ref name=ea/>  Credit for its quality and popularity was often attributed to Kinsley, whose wit and critical sensibility were seen as enlivening a magazine that had for many years been more conventional in its politics, and Hertzberg, a writer for ''[[The New Yorker '' and speechwriter for [[Jimmy Carter .  Hertzberg and Kinsley alternated as editor and as the author of the magazine's lead column, ""[[TRB  writer |TRB from Washington "". Its perspective was described as [[Left-wing politics|left-of-center  in 1988.<ref name=SBFK>Stephenson, D. Grier Jr., Bresler, Robert J., Freidrich, Robert J., Karlesky, Joseph J., editors, ''American Government'', New York: Harper & Row, 1988, , pp. 166, 171</ref>  A final ingredient that led to the magazine's increased stature in the 1980s was its ""back of the book"" or literary, cultural and arts pages, which were edited by [[Leon Wieseltier . Peretz discovered Wieseltier, then working at Harvard's Society of Fellows, and put him in charge of the section. Wieseltier reinvented the section along the lines of ''[[The New York Review of Books '', allowing his critics, many of them academics, to write longer, critical essays instead of simple book reviews. Alterman calls the selection of Wieseltier ""probably [...] Peretz's single most significant positive achievement"" in running the magazine. During other changes of editors, Wieseltier remained as cultural editor. Under him the section was ""simultaneously erudite and zestful,"" according to Alterman, who added, ""Amazingly, a full generation later, it still sings.""<ref name=ea/>  ===Sullivan editorship, 1991–1996=== In 1991, [[Andrew Sullivan , a 28-year-old, gay, self-described conservative from Britain, became editor. He took the magazine in a somewhat more conservative direction, though the majority of writers remained liberal or neo-liberal. Hertzberg soon left the magazine to return to ''The New Yorker''. Kinsley left the magazine in 1996 to found the online magazine ''[[Slate  magazine |Slate ''.<ref name=ea/>  In 1994, Sullivan invited [[Charles Murray  political scientist |Charles Murray  to contribute a 10,000-word article, excerpted from his coauthored book ''[[The Bell Curve ''. The article, which contended that ""African Americans score differently from whites on standardized tests of cognitive ability"" proved to be very controversial; it was published in a special issue together with many responses and critiques. The magazine also published a very critical article by [[Elizabeth McCaughey  about the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration 's [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|health care plan , commonly known as ""Hillarycare"" due to its close association with First Lady [[Hillary Clinton . Alterman described this article as ""dishonest, misinformed"", and ""the single most influential article published in the magazine during the entire Clinton presidency"",<ref name=""ea"" /> while [[James Fallows  of ''[[The Atlantic '' noted the article's inaccuracies and said that ""The White House issued a point-by-point rebuttal, which ''The New Republic'' did not run. Instead it published a long piece by McCaughey attacking the White House statement."" Sullivan also published a number of pieces by [[Camille Paglia .<ref name=ea/>  [[Ruth Shalit , a young writer for the magazine in the Sullivan years, was repeatedly criticized for plagiarism. After the Shalit scandals, the magazine began using fact-checkers during Sullivan's time as editor. One was [[Stephen Glass  reporter |Stephen Glass . When later working as a reporter, he was later found to have made up quotes, anecdotes and facts in his own articles.  These events were later dramatized in the feature film ''[[Shattered Glass  film |Shattered Glass '', adapted from a 1998 report by H.G. Bissinger. .<ref name=ea/>  ===Kelly, Lane, Beinart, Foer, Just editorships, 1996–2012=== After Sullivan stepped down in 1996, David Greenberg and [[Peter Beinart  served jointly as Acting Editors. After the 1996 election, [[Michael Kelly  editor |Michael Kelly  served as editor for a year. During his tenure as editor and afterward, Kelly, who also wrote the [[TRB  writer |TRB column , was intensely critical of President Clinton.<ref name=ea/> Writer [[Stephen Glass  reporter |Stephen Glass  had been a major contributor under Kelly's editorship; Glass was later shown to have falsified and fabricated numerous stories, which was admitted by The New Republic after an investigation by Kelly's successor, [[Charles Lane  journalist |Charles Lane . Kelly had consistently supported Glass during his tenure, including sending scathing letters to those challenging the veracity of Glass's stories.  [[Charles Lane  journalist |Chuck Lane  held the editor's position between 1997 and 1999. During Lane's tenure, the [[Stephen Glass  reporter |Stephen Glass  [[#Stephen Glass scandal|scandal  occurred. Peretz has written that Lane ultimately ""put the ship back on its course,"" for which Peretz said he was ""immensely grateful."" But Peretz later fired Lane, who learned of his ouster when a ''[[Washington Post '' reporter called him for a comment.<ref name=ea/>  [[Peter Beinart , a third editor who took over when he was 28 years old,<ref name=ea/> followed Lane. He served as editor from 1999 to 2006.  [[Franklin Foer  took over from Beinart in March 2006. In the magazine's first editorial under Foer, it said ""We've become more liberal … We've been encouraging Democrats to dream big again on the environment and economics [...]"".<ref name=ea/> Foer is the brother of novelist [[Jonathan Safran Foer , author of ''[[Everything Is Illuminated ''  2002 .  Other prominent writers who edited or wrote for the magazine in these years include senior editor and TRB columnist [[Jonathan Chait , [[Lawrence F. Kaplan , [[John Judis  and [[Spencer Ackerman .<ref name=ea/>  In 2005, ''TNR'' created its [[blog , called ''The Plank'', which is written by Michael Crowley, Franklin Foer, Jason Zengerle, and other ''TNR'' staff. ''The Plank'' is meant to be ''TNR'''s primary blog, replacing the magazine's first three blogs, ''&c.'', ''Iraq'd'', and ''Easterblogg''. ''The Stump'', TNR's blog on the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential Election  was created in October 2007.  The magazine remained well known, with references to it occasionally popping up in popular culture. [[Lisa Simpson  was once portrayed as a subscriber to ''The New Republic for Kids''. [[Matt Groening , ''[[The Simpsons ''' creator, once drew a cover for ''TNR''. In the [[Entourage  Pilot |pilot episode  of the [[HBO  series ''[[Entourage  U.S. TV series |Entourage ,'' which first aired on July 18, 2004, [[Ari Gold  Entourage |Ari Gold  asks [[Eric Murphy : ""Do you read ''The New Republic''? Well, I do, and it says that you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.""  ===Peretz sells remaining shares, then buys magazine back from CanWest=== Until February 2007, ''The New Republic'' was owned by Martin Peretz, New York financiers [[Roger Hertog  and [[Michael Steinhardt , and Canadian media conglomerate [[Canwest .<ref name=""nyt20060228""></ref>  In late February 2007, Peretz sold his share of the magazine to CanWest, which announced that a subsidiary, [[CanWest Media Works International , had acquired a full interest in the publication. Peretz retained his position as editor-in-chief.  In March 2009, Peretz and a group of investors, led by former Lazard executive Laurence Grafstein and that also included [[Michael Atler , bought the magazine back from CanWest, which was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Frank Foer continued as editor—the person responsible for the day-to-day management of the magazine—and Peretz remained editor-in-chief.  ===New format=== Starting with the March 19, 2007 issue, the magazine implemented major changes: * ''Decreased frequency'': the magazine went to publishing twice a month, or 24 times a year. This replaced the old plan of publishing 44 issues a year. The magazine described its publication schedule as ""biweekly,"" with specified ""skipped publication dates."" There were ten of these in 2010. * ''New design and layout'': Issues featured more visuals, new art and other ""reader friendly"" content. Warnock typeface throughout were accented by woodcut-style illustrations. * ''More pages and bigger size'': Issues are bigger and contain more pages. * ''Improved paper'': Covers and pages became sturdier. * ''Increased newsstand price'': Although the subscription prices did not change, the newsstand price increased from $3.95 to $4.95. * ''Website redesign'': The website offered more daily content and new features. [[Richard Just  took over as editor of the magazine on December 8, 2010.  ===Chris Hughes ownership and editorial crisis, 2012–2016=== On March 9, 2012, [[Chris Hughes , co-founder of [[Facebook , was introduced as the ''New Republic''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> majority owner and Editor-in-Chief. Under Hughes, the magazine became less focused on ""[[Inside the Beltway|The Beltway "", with more cultural coverage and attention to visuals. It stopped running an editorial in every issue. Media observers noted a less uniformly pro-Israel tone in the magazine's coverage  in contrast to its editorial stance during Marty Peretz's ownership .  On December 4, 2014, [[Gabriel Snyder , previously of [[Gawker  and Bloomberg, replaced Franklin Foer as editor. The magazine was reduced from twenty issues per year to ten and the editorial offices would move from [[Penn Quarter|Penn Quarter, Washington DC  to New York, where it would be reinvented as a “vertically integrated digital-media company.” <ref name=""newyorker.com""></ref> These changes provoked a major crisis among the publication's editorial staff and contributing editors. The magazine’s literary editor, [[Leon Wieseltier , resigned in protest. Subsequent days brought many more resignations, including those of executive editors Rachel Morris and Greg Veis; nine of the magazine’s eleven active senior writers; legal-affairs editor [[Jeffrey Rosen  academic |Jeffrey Rosen ; the digital-media editor; six culture writers and editors; and thirty-six out of thirty-eight contributing editors  including Paul Berman, Jonathan Chait, William Deresiewicz, Ruth Franklin, Anthony Grafton, Enrique Krauze, Ryan Lizza, Sacha Z. Scoblic, Helen Vendler, Sean Wilentz . In all, two-thirds of the names on the editorial masthead were gone.<ref name=""newyorker.com"" />  The mass resignations forced the magazine to suspend its December 2014 edition. Previously a weekly for most of its history, immediately before suspension it was published 10 times per year with a circulation of approximately 50,000.<ref name=""circulation2013"" /> The company went back to publishing twenty issues a year, and editor Gabriel Snyder worked with staff to reshape it.  In the wake of the editorial crisis, Hughes indicated that he intended to stay with ''The New Republic'' over the long term, telling an [[NPR  interviewer of his desire to make sure the magazine could produce quality journalism ""hopefully for decades to come"". He published an open letter about his ""commitment"" to give the magazine ""a new mandate for a new century."" But on January 11, 2016, Hughes put ''The New Republic'' up for sale. In another open letter, he said, ""After investing a great deal of time, energy, and over $20 million, I have come to the conclusion that it is time for new leadership and vision at The New Republic.""  ===Win McCormack ownership, 2016 to present=== In February 2016, [[Win McCormack  bought the magazine from Hughes<ref name="":0"" />, naming Eric Bates, the former executive editor of ''[[Rolling Stone '', as editor. In September 2017, Bates resigned to become editor at large. [[J.J. Gould  then served as editor through December 2018. In November 2017, [[Hamilton Fish V , the publisher since McCormack's acquisition of the magazine, resigned amid allegations of workplace misconduct. Kerrie Gillis was named publisher in February 2019  Chris Lehmann, formerly the editor in chief of The Baffler, was named Editor in March 2019.  ==Circulation==  ===Print circulation in the 2000s=== ''The New Republic'''s average paid circulation for 2009 was 53,485 copies per issue, a decline of over 47 percent since 2000.<!-- do we have access to any circulation figures for the print magazine during the 1950s through 2000? -->  {| class=""wikitable"" style=""text-align:center"" |+''The New Republic'' average monthly paid circulation |- !

By June 9, 2012, the ''TNR'' website's monthly page visits dropped to 421,000 in the U.S. and 521,000 globally.  As of April 16, 2014, the ''TNR'' website's Quantcast webpage contains the following messages: ""This publisher has not implemented Quantcast Measurement.

Straight's espionage activities began at Cambridge during the 1930s; he later claimed that they ceased during World War II. Later, shortly before serving in the Kennedy administration, he revealed his past ties and turned in fellow spy Anthony Blunt. In return for his cooperation, his own involvement was kept secret and he continued to serve in various capacities for the US Government until he retired. Straight admitted his involvement in his memoirs; however, subsequent documents obtained from the former KGB after the fall of the Soviet Union indicated that he drastically understated the extent of his espionage activities.  ===Ruth Shalit plagiarism=== In 1995, writer [[Ruth Shalit  was fired for repeated incidents of [[plagiarism  and an excess of factual errors in her articles.  ===Stephen Glass scandal=== In 1998, features writer [[Stephen Glass  was revealed in a ''[[Forbes|Forbes Digital '' investigation to have fabricated a story called ""Hack Heaven"". A ''TNR'' investigation found that most of Glass' stories had used or been based on fabricated information. The story of Glass' fall and ''TNR'' editor [[Charles Lane  journalist |Chuck Lane 's handling of the scandal was dramatized in the 2003 film ''[[Shattered Glass  film |Shattered Glass '', based on a 1998 article in ''[[Vanity Fair  magazine |Vanity Fair ''.  ===Lee Siegel=== In 2006, long-time contributor, critic, and senior editor [[Lee Siegel  cultural critic |Lee Siegel , who had maintained a blog on the ''TNR'' site dedicated primarily to art and culture, was revealed by an investigation to have collaborated in posting comments to his own blog under an alias aggressively praising Siegel, attacking his critics and claiming not to be Lee Siegel when challenged by an anonymous detractor on his blog. The blog was removed from the website and Siegel was suspended from writing for the print magazine. He resumed writing for ''TNR'' in April 2007. Siegel was also controversial for his coinage ""blogofascists"" which he applied to ""the entire political blogosphere"", though with an emphasis on leftwing or center-left bloggers such as [[Daily Kos  and [[Atrios .  ===Spencer Ackerman=== In 2006, associate editor [[Spencer Ackerman  was fired by editor Franklin Foer. Describing it as a ""painful"" decision, Foer attributed the firing to Ackerman's ""insubordination"": disparaging the magazine on his personal blog, saying that he would ""skullfuck"" a terrorist's corpse at an editorial meeting if that was required to ""establish his anti-terrorist ''bona fides''"" and sending Foer an e-mail where he said—in what according to Ackerman was intended to be a joke—he would “make a niche in your skull” with a baseball bat. Ackerman, by contrast, argued that the dismissal was due to “irreconcilable ideological differences.” He believed that his leftward drift as a result of the Iraq War and the actions of the Bush administration was not appreciated by the senior editorial staff. Within 24 hours of being fired by ''The New Republic'', Ackerman was hired as a senior correspondent for a rival magazine, ''[[The American Prospect ''.  ===Scott Thomas Beauchamp controversy===   In July 2007, after ''The New Republic'' published an article by an American soldier in Iraq titled ""Shock Troops"", allegations of inadequate fact-checking were leveled against the magazine. Critics alleged that the piece contained inconsistent details indicative of fabrication. The identity of the anonymous soldier, [[Scott Thomas Beauchamp , was revealed. Beauchamp was married to Elspeth Reeve, one of the magazine's three fact-checkers. As a result of the controversy, the ''New Republic'' and the [[United States Army  launched investigations, reaching different conclusions.<ref name=wapo></ref><ref name=nyt>Story, Louise  July 24, 2007 .

''The New York Times''.</ref><ref name=weeklystandard></ref> In an article titled ""The Fog of War"", published on December 1, 2007, Franklin Foer wrote that the magazine could no longer stand behind the stories written by Beauchamp.  === Leon Wieseltier controversy === On October 24, 2017, Leon Wieseltier, a former literary editor at ''The New Republic''  from 1983 until his resignation in 2014 , admitted to “offenses against some of my colleagues in the past” after several women accused him of sexual harassment and inappropriate advances.  ==Editors== # [[Herbert Croly   1914–1930  # Bruce Bliven  1930–1946  # [[Henry A.

","The New Republic is an American magazine of commentary on politics and the arts, published since 1914, with influence on American political and cultural thinking. Founded in 1914 by leaders of the progressive movement, it attempted to find a balance between a humanitarian progressivism and an intellectual scientism, ultimately discarding the latter. Through the 1980s and '90s, the magazine incorporated elements of ""Third Way"" neoliberalism and conservatism.In 2014, two years after Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, purchased the magazine, he ousted its editor and attempted to remake its format, operations and partisan stances, provoking the resignation of the majority of its editors and writers. In early 2016, Hughes announced he was putting the magazine up for sale, indicating the need for ""new vision and leadership"". It was sold in February 2016 to Win McCormack."

It began in 2007 as a project of the ''[[Tampa Bay Times ''  then the ''St. Petersburg Times'' , with reporters and editors from the [[newspaper  and its affiliated news media partners reporting on the accuracy of statements made by elected officials, candidates, their staffs, lobbyists, interest groups and others involved in [[U.S. politics . Its journalists evaluate original statements and publish their findings on the PolitiFact.com website, where each statement receives a ""Truth-O-Meter"" rating. The ratings range from ""True"" for completely accurate statements to ""Pants on Fire""  from the taunt ""Liar, liar, pants on fire""  for false and ridiculous claims.   '''PunditFact''', a related site that was also created by the ''Times'' editors, is devoted to [[fact-checking  claims made by [[political pundit s. Both PolitiFact and PunditFact were funded primarily by the ''Tampa Bay Times'' and ad revenues generated on the website until 2018, and the ''Times'' continues to sell ads for the site now that it is part of Poynter, a non-profit organization that also owns the newspaper. PolitiFact increasingly relies on [[grants  from several nonpartisan organizations, and in 2017 launched a membership campaign and began accepting donations from readers.  In addition to political claims, the site monitors the progress elected officials make on their campaign promises, including a ""Trump-O-Meter"" for [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump  and an ""Obameter"" for [[President of the United States|President  [[Barack Obama .

PolitiFact has won several awards, and has been both praised and criticized by independent observers, conservatives and liberals alike. Both liberal and conservative bias have been alleged at different points, and criticisms have been made that PolitiFact attempts to fact-check statements that cannot be truly ""fact-checked"".  == History == PolitiFact.com was started in August 2007 by ''Times'' Washington Bureau Chief [[Bill Adair  journalist |Bill Adair , in conjunction with the ''[[Congressional Quarterly ''.  In January 2010, PolitiFact.com expanded to its second newspaper, the [[Cox Enterprises  –owned ''[[Austin American-Statesman '' in [[Austin, Texas ; the feature, called PolitiFact Texas, covers issues that are relevant to Texas and the Austin area.  In March 2010, the Times and its partner newspaper, ''[[The Miami Herald '', launched PolitiFact Florida, which focuses on Florida issues. The Times and the Herald share resources on some stories that relate to Florida.  Since then, PolitiFact.com expanded to other papers, such as ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution '', ''[[The Providence Journal '', ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel '', ''[[The Plain Dealer '', ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch '', the ''[[Knoxville News Sentinel '' and ''[[The Oregonian ''. The ''[[Knoxville News Sentinel '' ended its relationship with PolitiFact.com after 2012.  In 2013, Adair was named Knight Professor of the Practice of Journalism and Public Policy at [[Duke University , and stepped down as Bureau Chief at the ''Times'' and as editor at PolitiFact.com.<ref name=""duke"">[http://today.duke.edu/2013/04/adair Bill Adair, PolitiFact Editor, Named Knight Professor at Duke] ; April 5, 2013</ref> The ''Tampa Bay Times''' senior reporter, Alex Leary, succeeded Bill Adair as Bureau Chief on July 1, 2013,<ref name=""duke"" /> and Angie Drobnic Holan was appointed editor of PolitiFact in October 2013. Adair remains a PolitiFact.com contributing editor.  In 2014, ''The Plain Dealer'' ended its partnership with PolitiFact.com after they reduced their news staff and were unwilling to meet ""the required several PolitiFact investigations per week"".  The organization was acquired in February 2018 by the [[Poynter Institute , a non-profit journalism education and news media research center that also owns the ''Tampa Bay Times''.  == ""Lie of the Year"" == Since 2009, PolitiFact.com has declared one political statement from each year to be the ""Lie of the Year"".  ; 2009 In December 2009, they declared the Lie of the Year to be [[Sarah Palin 's assertion that the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  of 2009 would lead to government ""[[death panel s"" that dictated which types of patients would receive treatment.  ; 2010 In December 2010, PolitiFact.com dubbed the Lie of the Year to be the contention among some opponents of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that it represented a ""government takeover of healthcare"". PolitiFact.com argued that this was not the case, since all health care and insurance would remain in the hands of private companies.  ; 2011 PolitiFact's Lie of the Year for 2011 was a statement by the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee   DCCC  that a 2011 budget proposal by Congressman [[Paul Ryan , entitled ''[[The Path to Prosperity '' and voted for overwhelmingly by Republicans in the House and Senate, meant that ""Republicans voted to end [[Medicare  United States |Medicare "". PolitiFact determined that, though the Republican plan would make significant changes to Medicare, it would not end it. PolitiFact had originally labeled nine similar statements as ""false"" or ""pants on fire"" since April 2011.  ; 2012 For 2012, PolitiFact chose the claim made by Republican presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney  that President Obama ""sold [[Chrysler  to Italians who are going to build [[Jeep s in China"" at the cost of American jobs.<ref name=""lie of the year 2012""></ref>  The ""Italians"" in the quote was a reference to [[Fiat , who had purchased a majority share of Chrysler in 2011 after a [[Automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010|U.S. government bailout  of Chrysler.  PolitiFact had rated the claim ""Pants on Fire"" in October. PolitiFact's assessment quoted a Chrysler spokesman who had said, ""Jeep has no intention of shifting production of its Jeep models out of North America to China.""<ref name=""lie of the year 2012"" /> As of 2016, 96.7 percent of Jeeps sold in the U.S were assembled in the U.S., with roughly 70 percent North American parts content.  The vehicle with the most North American parts content came in at 75% .  ; 2013 The 2013 Lie of the Year was President [[Barack Obama 's promise that ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it"".<ref name=""2013loty""></ref> As evidence, PolitiFact cited 4 million cancellation letters sent to American health insurance consumers. PolitiFact also noted that in an online poll, readers overwhelmingly agreed with the selection.<ref name=""2013loty"" />  This stands in stark contrast to its October 9, 2008 statement that Obama’s “description of his plan is accurate, and we rate his statement True.”   ; 2014 PolitiFact's 2014 Lie of the Year was ""Exaggerations about Ebola"", referring to 16 separate statements made by various commentators and politicians about the [[Ebola virus  being ""easy to catch, that illegal immigrants may be carrying the virus across the southern border, that it was all part of a government or corporate conspiracy"". These claims were made in the midst of the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa  when [[Ebola virus cases in the United States|four cases were diagnosed in the United States  in travelers from West Africa and nurses who treated them. PolitiFact wrote, ""The claims – all wrong – distorted the debate about a serious public health issue.""  ; 2015 PolitiFact's 2015 Lie of the Year was the ""various statements"" made by 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Politifact found that 76% of Trump's statements that they reviewed were rated ""Mostly False,"" ""False"" or ""Pants on Fire"". Statements that were rated ""Pants on Fire"" included his assertion that the Mexican government sends ""the bad ones over"" the border into the United States, and his claim that he saw ""thousands and thousands"" of people cheering the collapse of the [[September 11 attacks|World Trade Center on 9/11 .  ; 2016 PolitiFact's 2016 Lie of the Year was ""[[fake news website|fake news "" referring to fabricated news stories including the [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory .  ; 2017 PolitiFact's 2017 Lie of the Year was Donald Trump's claim that [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian election interference  is a ""made-up story."" The annual poll found 56.36% of the 5080 respondents agreed that Trump's ""Pants on Fire"" statement deserved the distinction. Raul Labrador's statement that "" Nobody dies because they don't have access to health care,"" and Sean Spicer's statement that ""[Trump's audience] was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period,"" came in second and third place getting 14.47% and 14.25% of the vote respectively. In its article, PolitiFact points to multiple occasions where Donald Trump stated that Russia had not interfered with the election despite multiple government agencies claiming otherwise.  ; 2018 Survivors of the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting  were the subject of lies that became Politifact's 2018 Lie of the Year. Students including [[Emma González  and [[David Hogg  activist |David Hogg , who became prominent gun control activists in the wake of the shooting and helped organize the [[March for our Lives , were the subjects of conspiracy theories that they were ""crisis actors"". The lies were spread on blogs and social media by sources including [[InfoWars .   == Reception == PolitiFact.com was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting  in 2009 for ""its fact-checking initiative during the 2008 presidential campaign that used probing reporters and the power of the World Wide Web to examine more than 750 political claims, separating rhetoric from truth to enlighten voters"".  A ''[[Wall Street Journal '' opinion editorial by [[Joseph Rago  in December 2010 called PolitiFact ""part of a larger journalistic trend that seeks to recast all political debates as matters of lies, misinformation and 'facts,' rather than differences of world view or principles"".<ref name=""politifiction""></ref>  TV critic [[James Poniewozik  at ''[[Time  magazine |Time '' characterized PolitiFact as having the ""hard-earned and important position as referee in the mudslinging contest—a 'truth vigilante,' as it were"", and ""PolitiFact is trying to do the right thing here. And despite the efforts of partisans to work the refs by complaining about various calls they’ve made in the past, they’re generally doing a hard, important thing well. They often do it better than the rest of the political media, and the political press owes them for doing it."" Poniewozik also suggested, ""they need to improve their rating system, to address the irresponsible, the unprovable, the dubious. Otherwise, they’re doing exactly what they were founded to stop: using language to spread false impressions.""<ref name=""poniewozik""></ref>  Mark Hemingway of ''[[The Weekly Standard '' criticized all fact-checking projects by news organizations, including PolitiFact, the [[Associated Press  and the ''[[Washington Post '', writing that they ""aren't about checking facts so much as they are about a rearguard action to keep inconvenient truths out of the conversation"".  In February 2011, [[University of Minnesota  political science professor Eric Ostermeier analyzed 511 PolitiFact stories issued from January 2010 through January 2011. He found that the number of statements analyzed from Republicans and from Democrats was comparable, but Republicans have been assigned substantially harsher grades, receiving 'false' or 'pants on fire' more than three times as often as Democrats. Ostermeier suggested that this may indicate a bias in the selection of statements to analyze, concluding: ""The question is not whether PolitiFact will ultimately convert skeptics on the right that they do not have ulterior motives in the selection of what statements are rated, but whether the organization can give a convincing argument that either a  Republicans in fact do lie much more than Democrats, or b  if they do not, that it is immaterial that PolitiFact covers political discourse with a frame that suggests this is the case."" PolitiFact editor Bill Adair responded in ''[[MinnPost '': ""Eric Ostermeier's study is particularly timely because we've heard a lot of charges this week that we are biased—from liberals [...] So we're accustomed to hearing strong reactions from people on both ends of the political spectrum. We are a news organization and we choose which facts to check based on news judgment.""  In December 2011, [[Northeastern University  journalism professor Dan Kennedy wrote in the ''[[Huffington Post '' that the problem with fact-checking projects was ""there are only a finite number of statements that can be subjected to thumbs-up/thumbs-down fact-checking"".  [[Matt Welch , in the February 2013 issue of ''[[Reason  magazine |Reason '' magazine, criticized PolitiFact and other media fact-checkers for focusing much more on statements by politicians about their opponents, rather than statements by politicians and government officials about their own policies, thus serving as ""a check on the exercise of rhetoric"" but not ""a check on the exercise of power"".  == See also == * [[Glenn Kessler  journalist |The Fact Checker  * [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting  * [[FactCheck.org   == References ==   == External links == *      [[Category:Tampa Bay Times  [[Category:Internet properties established in 2007  [[Category:American political websites  [[Category:Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting winners  [[Category:Fact-checking websites  [[Category:2007 establishments in Florida ","PolitiFact.com is a nonprofit project operated by the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg, Florida, with offices there and in Washington, D.C..

Patel replaced Topolsky as editor-in-chief in mid-2014. Journalist [[Walt Mossberg  joined ''The Verge'' editing team after Vox Media acquired ''Recode'' in 2015. By 2016, the website's advertising had shifted from display advertisements, matched with articles' contents, to partnerships and advertisements adjusted to the user.  === 2016–present === Vox Media revamped ''The Verge'' visual design for its fifth anniversary in November 2016. ''The Verge'' logo featured a modified [[Penrose triangle , an [[impossible object . On November 1, ''The Verge'' launched version 3.0 of its news platform, offering a redesigned website along with a new logo.  In September 2016, ''The Verge'' fired deputy editor Chris Ziegler after it learned that he had been working for Apple since July.

In May 2018, Verge Science launched a YouTube channel, which had more than 638,000 subscribers and 30 million views by January 2019. The channel received more than 5.3 million views in November 2018 alone.  == Content ==  === Podcasts === ''The Verge'' broadcasts a live weekly [[podcast  called ''The Vergecast''. The inaugural episode was broadcast on November 4, 2011. Unlike many episodes of previous podcasts, it included a video stream of the hosts. A second weekly podcast was introduced on November 8, 2011. Unlike ''The Vergecast'', ''The Verge Mobile Show'' was primarily focused on mobile phones. ''The Verge'' also launched the weekly podcast ''Ctrl-Walt-Delete'', hosted by [[Walt Mossberg , in September 2015. ''The Verge'' ''What's Tech'' podcast was named among iTunes's best of 2015.<ref name=""Vox Marketing: 2015 podcasts"" /> The podcast ''Why'd You Push That Button?'', launched in 2017 and co-hosted by Ashley Carman and Kaitlyn Tiffany, received a [[Podcast Awards|Podcast Award  in the ""This Week in Tech Technology Category"" in 2018.  === Video content ===  ==== ''On The Verge'' ==== On August 6, 2011, in an interview with [[Edelman  firm |Edelman , ''The Verge'' co-founder [[Marty Moe  announced that they would soon be launching ''The Verge Show'', a [[web television  series.  After the site's launch, the show was named ''On The Verge''. The first episode was taped on Monday, November 14, 2011, with guest [[Matias Duarte . The show is a [[technology journalism|technology news  entertainment show, and its format is similar to that of a [[late-night talk show , but it is broadcast over the [[Internet , not on [[television . The show's first episode was released on November 15, 2011.  Ten episodes of ''On The Verge'' were broadcast, with the most recent episode going out on November 10, 2012. On May 24, 2013, it was announced that the show would return under a new weekly format, alongside a new logo and theme tune.  ==== Other video content ==== On May 8, 2013, editor-in-chief Topolsky announced ''Verge Video'', a site that contains the video backlog from The Verge.  ''Circuit Breaker'', a [[gadget  blog launched in 2016, has amassed nearly one million Facebook followers and debuted a live show on Twitter in October 2017. The blog's videos average more than 465,000 views, and Jake Kastrenakes serves as editor-in-chief, as of 2017. Also in 2016, [[USA Network  and ''The Verge'' partnered on ''Mr. Robot Digital After Show'', a digital [[aftershow  for the television series ''[[Mr. Robot ''. In December, Twitter and Vox Media announced a [[live streaming  partnership for ''The Verge'' programs covering the [[Consumer Electronics Show .  The series ''Next Level'', hosted and produced by Lauren Goode, debuted in 2017 and was recognized in the ""Technology"" category at the 47th annual [[San Francisco / Northern California Emmy Awards   2018 . In August 2017, ''The Verge'' launched a new web series called ''Space Craft'', hosted by science reporter Loren Grush.  == Controversy == In September 2018, ''The Verge'' published an article titled ""How to Build a Custom PC for Editing, Gaming or Coding"" and uploaded a video to [[YouTube  entitled ""How we Built a $2000 Custom Gaming PC"", which was widely criticized for its numerous factual errors. This included ''The Verge'' reporter Stefan Etienne wearing an [[antistatic wrist strap  without [[Ground  electricity |grounding  it, installing the [[RAM  and [[video card  in incorrect slots, applying excessive [[thermal grease , and installing the [[Power supply unit  computer |power supply unit  in a way that blocks airflow to it.<ref name=""Ars"" /> After initially disabling comments, ''The Verge'' removed the video entirely. In February 2019, lawyers from ''The Verge''s parent company Vox Media filed a [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA  takedown notice, requesting YouTube to remove videos critical of ''The Verge''s video, alleging copyright infringement. YouTube took down two of the videos, uploaded by YouTube channels BitWit and ReviewTechUSA, while applying a copyright ""strike"" to these two channels.<ref name=""Ars"" /> After an outcry following the decision, YouTube reinstated these two videos, along with retracting the copyright ""strikes"" applied. Timothy B. Lee of ''[[Ars Technica '' described this controversy as an example of the [[Streisand effect , saying that while law regarding [[fair use  is unclear regarding this type of situation, ""the one legal precedent ... suggests ... that this kind of video is solidly within the bounds of copyright's fair use doctrine.""<ref name=""Ars""></ref>  == References == </ref>  <ref name=""ATD: Engadget's Top Editors""></ref>  <ref name=""ATD: SB Nation Sacks AOL""></ref>  <ref name=""BI: Paul Miller""></ref>  <ref name=""BI: Quit AOL""></ref>  <ref name=""BI: The Engadget Team""></ref>  <ref name=""BI: The Raid on AOL""></ref>  <ref name=""CNNMoney: Beyond just gadgets""></ref>  <ref name=""Edelman""></ref>  <ref name=""Forbes: AOL Defector""></ref>  <ref name=""GO: Deflection""></ref>  <ref name=""NYM: AOL Loses""></ref>  <ref name=""NYT: Shackled""></ref>  <ref name=""PCM: New Rival Tech Site""></ref>  <ref name=""Time: Best Blogs of 2011""></ref>  <ref name=""Vox Marketing: 2015 podcasts""></ref>     == External links == *       [[Category:The Verge|   [[Category:American news websites  [[Category:Technology websites  [[Category:Computing websites  [[Category:Internet properties established in 2011  [[Category:Media in New York City  [[Category:Internet broadcasting  [[Category:Internet television  [[Category:Video podcasts  [[Category:Video bloggers  [[Category:Vox Media ","The Verge is an American technology news and media network operated by Vox Media.

He was succeeded by [[Altaf Husain  who as the journal's editor, galvanised the Muslims of India for independence by his editorials, which earned him ire of the Congress Party and of [[Lord Mountbatten , the last Viceroy and Governor General of the [[British Raj  both of whom wanted a united India.

The foundation was formed in July 1990 by [[John Gilmore  activist |John Gilmore , [[John Perry Barlow  and [[Mitch Kapor  to promote [[Internet  [[civil liberties .  EFF provides funds for legal defense in court, presents [[amicus curiae  briefs, defends individuals and new [[Technology|technologies  from what it considers abusive legal threats, works to expose [[government  malfeasance, provides guidance to the government and [[court s, organizes political action and mass mailings, supports some new technologies which it believes preserve [[Liberty|personal freedoms  and online civil liberties, maintains a [[database  and web sites of related news and information, monitors and challenges potential [[legislation  that it believes would infringe on [[Liberty|personal liberties  and [[fair use  and solicits a list of what it considers [[Patent misuse|abusive patents  with intentions to defeat those that it considers without [[merit  law |merit .  EFF also provides tips, tools, how-tos, tutorials, and software for safer online communications.  ==History==     ===Foundation=== The Electronic Frontier Foundation was formed in July 1990 by [[John Gilmore  activist |John Gilmore , [[John Perry Barlow  and [[Mitch Kapor  in response to a series of actions by law enforcement agencies that led them to conclude that the authorities were gravely uninformed about emerging forms of online communication,<ref name=j1/> and that there was a need for increased protection for [[Internet  [[civil liberties .  In April 1990, Barlow had been visited by a U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation  agent in relation to the theft and distribution of the source code for a series of Macintosh ROMs. Barlow described the visit as ""complicated by [the agent's] fairly complete unfamiliarity with computer technology. I realized right away that before I could demonstrate my innocence, I would first have to explain to him what guilt might be."" Barlow felt that his experience was symptomatic of a ""great paroxysm of governmental confusion during which everyone's liberties would become at risk"".  Barlow posted an account of this experience to [[The WELL  online community and was contacted by Mitch Kapor, who had had a similar experience. The pair agreed that there was a need to defend civil liberties on the Internet. Kapor agreed to fund any legal fees associated with such a defense and the pair contacted New York lawyers Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky and Lieberman about defending several computer hackers from a ''Harper's'' magazine forum on computers and freedom who had been the target of [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service  raids.<ref name=""j1""></ref> This generated a large amount of publicity which led to offers of financial support from [[John Gilmore  activist |John Gilmore  and [[Steve Wozniak . Barlow and Kapor continued to research conflicts between the government and technology and in June 1990, Barlow posted online the influential article entitled ""Crime & Puzzlement"" in which Barlow announced his and Kapor's plans to create an organization to ""raise and disburse funds for education, lobbying, and litigation in the areas relating to digital speech and the extension of the Constitution into Cyberspace.""  This generated further reaction and support for the ideas of Barlow and Kapor. In late June, Barlow held a series of dinners in [[San Francisco  with major figures in the computer industry to develop a coherent response to these perceived threats. Barlow considered that: ""The actions of the FBI and Secret Service were symptoms of a growing social crisis: Future Shock. America was entering the Information Age with neither laws nor metaphors for the appropriate protection and conveyance of information itself.""<ref name=""barlow-history""></ref> Barlow felt that to confront this a formal organization would be needed; he hired Cathy Cook as press coordinator, and began to set up what would become the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation was formally founded on July 10, 1990, by Kapor and Barlow, who very soon after elected Gilmore, Wozniak, and [[Stewart Brand  to join them on the Board of Directors.<ref name=""barlow-history"" />  Initial funding was provided by Kapor, Wozniak, and an anonymous benefactor.<ref name=""mission""></ref>  In 1990, [[Mike Godwin  joined the organization as its first staff counsel. Then in 1991, [[Esther Dyson  and [[Jerry Berman  joined the EFF board of directors. By 1992, Cliff Figallo became the director of the original office, and in December 1992, Jerry Berman became the acting executive director of the organization as a whole, based in a new second office.  ===Early cases=== The creation of the organization was motivated by the massive [[search and seizure  on [[Steve Jackson Games  executed by the [[United States Secret Service  early in 1990. Similar but officially unconnected law-enforcement raids were being conducted across the United States at about that time as part of a state–federal task force called [[Operation Sundevil . [[GURPS Cyberpunk , one of the game company's projects, was mistakenly labeled as a handbook for computer crime, and the Secret Service raided the offices of Steve Jackson Games. The [[search warrant  for the raid was deemed hastily issued, and the games company soon after claimed unauthorized access as well as tampering of their emails. While phone calls were protected by legislation, digital emails were an early concept and had not been considered to fall under the right to personal privacy. The [[Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service|Steve Jackson Games case  was EFF's first high-profile case, was the major rallying point around which EFF began promoting computer- and Internet-related civil liberties.  EFF's second big case was ''[[Bernstein v. United States '' led by [[Cindy Cohn , in which programmer and professor [[Daniel J. Bernstein  sued the government for permission to publish his [[encryption  software, Snuffle, and a paper describing it. More recently, the organization has been involved in defending [[Edward Felten , [[Jon Lech Johansen  and [[Dmitry Sklyarov .  ===Expansion and development===  [[File:Electronic Frontier Foundation 20th anniversary mecha poster.jpg|thumb|In early 2010, EFF released this poster in celebration of its founding 20 years before.   The organization was originally located at Mitch Kapor's Kapor Enterprises offices.<ref name=harris2002></ref>  By the fall of 1993, the main EFF offices were consolidated into a single office,<ref name=harris2002/>  headed by Executive Director Jerry Berman.  During this time, some of EFF's attention focused on [[Lobbying|influencing national policy ,<ref name=harris2002/>  to the dislike of some of the members of the organization.<ref name=harris2002/><ref name=timberg2013></ref>  In 1994, Berman parted ways with EFF and formed the [[Center for Democracy and Technology ,<ref name=harris2002/>  while Drew Taubman briefly took the reins as executive director.  In 1995, under the auspices of Executive Director [[Lori Fena ,  after some downsizing and in an effort to regroup and refocus on their base of support,  the organization moved offices to San Francisco, California.<ref name=harris2002/><ref name=timberg2013/>  There, it took up temporary residence at [[John Gilmore  activist |John Gilmore's  Toad Hall,  and soon afterward moved into the Hamm's Building at 1550 Bryant St.  After Fena moved onto the EFF board of directors for a while,  the organization was led briefly by [[Tara Lemmey ,  followed by Barry Steinhardt   who had come from the closely allied Technology and Liberty Program at the [[American Civil Liberties Union ,  and eventually returned to the ACLU .  Not long before EFF's move into new offices at 454 Shotwell St. in SF's Mission District,  Mike Godwin departed,  long-time Legal Director Shari Steele was appointed as executive director,  and staff attorney [[Cindy Cohn  became the legal director.  In the spring of 2006, EFF announced the opening of an office again in Washington, D.C., with two new staff attorneys.  In 2012, EFF began a fundraising campaign for the renovation of a building located at 815 Eddy Street in San Francisco, to serve as its new headquarters.  The move was completed in April, 2013.  On April 1, 2015, Shari Steele stepped down as Executive Director.  Cindy Cohn became the new executive director,  Corynne McSherry became the legal director,  and Kurt Opsahl became the general counsel.  ===DES cracker===  By the mid-1990s the EFF was becoming seriously concerned about the refusal of the US Government to license any secure encryption product for export unless it utilized [[key escrow|key recovery  and claims that governments could not decrypt information when protected by [[Data Encryption Standard|DES , continuing even after the public breaking of the code in the first of the [[DES Challenges . They coordinated and supported the construction of the ''EFF DES cracker''  nicknamed Deep Crack , using special purpose hardware and software and costing only $210,000. This brought the record for breaking a message down to 56 hours on 17 July 1998 and to under 24 hours on 19 Jan 1999  in conjunction with [[distributed.net  .  The EFF published the plans and source code for the cracker. Within four years the [[Advanced Encryption Standard  was standardized as a replacement for DES.  ==Activities==  ===Legislative activity=== The EFF is a leading supporter of the [[Email Privacy Act .<ref name=""Cope"">Sophia Cope, [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/house-advances-email-privacy-act-setting-stage-vital-privacy-reform House Advances Email Privacy Act, Setting the Stage for Vital Privacy Reform], Electronic Frontier Foundation  April 27, 2016 .</ref>  ===Litigation=== [[File:2010 RSA Conference - EFF booth.jpg|thumb|EFF booth at the 2010 RSA Conference   The EFF regularly brings and defends lawsuits at all levels of the US legal system in pursuit of its goals and objectives. The EFF has long taken a stance against [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|strategic lawsuits against public participation   SLAPP  as attempts to stymie free speech and advocated for effective anti-SLAPP legislation. Many of the most significant technology law cases have involved the EFF, including ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. '', ''[[Apple v. Does '', and others.  ===Awards===  The EFF organizes two sets of awards to promote work in accordance with its goals and objectives:  The [[EFF Pioneer Award s are awarded annually to recognize individuals who in its opinion are ""leaders who are extending freedom and innovation on the electronic frontier.""<ref name=""Eff Pioneer Awards Website""></ref> In 2017, the honorees were [[Chelsea Manning , [[Mike Masnick  and Annie Game.

The initiative launched on April 19, 2004 and involves two phases: documenting the damage caused by these patents, and submitting challenges to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office   USPTO .  ===Publications=== EFF publishes through several outlets such as the online periodical ''EFFector''  ISSN 1062-9424 , as well as its websites, blogs, and on social networking services.  EFF's first book was published in 1993 as ''The Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet'', a beginners' how-to manual by contracted [[Technical writing|technical writer  Adam Gaffin, and made available for free download in many formats. [[MIT Press  published it in paperback form in 1994 as ''Everybody's Guide to the Internet''   . The online edition was updated regularly throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, and translated into dozens of languages.  The organization's second book, ''Protecting Yourself Online''   , an overview of digital civil liberties, was written in 1998 by technical writer Robert B. Gelman and EFF Communications Director Stanton McCandlish, and published by [[HarperCollins .  A third book, ''Cracking DES: Secrets of Encryption Research, Wiretap Politics & Chip Design''   , focusing on EFF's DES Cracker project, was published the same year by [[O'Reilly Media .  A digital book, ''[[Pwn ing Tomorrow'', an [[anthology  of [[speculative fiction , was produced in 2015 as part of EFF's 25th anniversary activities, and includes contributions from 22 writers, including [[Charlie Jane Anders , [[Paolo Bacigalupi , [[Lauren Beukes , [[David Brin , [[Pat Cadigan , [[Cory Doctorow , [[Neil Gaiman , [[Eileen Gunn , [[Kameron Hurley , [[James Patrick Kelly , [[Ramez Naam , [[Annalee Newitz , [[Hannu Rajaniemi , [[Rudy Rucker , [[Lewis Shiner , [[Bruce Sterling , and [[Charles Yu .  The Electronic Frontier Foundation's [[blog , ''DeepLinks'', is a major section of its main website at EFF.org.  The EFF sent a video message of support to global grassroots movement [[CryptoParty .  === Recent activism === The EFF was active in the [[United States presidential election 2016  because of online [[phishing  related to the controversy over [[Lie#Fabrication|fabrication  of election results. [[J. Alex Halderman , a computer security professor at the [[University of Michigan , wrote an article that was published in [[Medium  website |''Medium''  in 2016 stating he thought it was advisable to have a recount on some of the election results from states like [[Wisconsin , [[Michigan , and [[Pennsylvania . In retaliation for Halderman standing up for the uncertain election results, a hacker sent [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic  and [[Racism|racist  emails to students at University of Michigan signed from Halderman. The EFF publicizes these controversies and promotes the reduction of online phishing.  ==Software== The EFF has developed some software and browser add-ons, including [[Switzerland  software |Switzerland , [[HTTPS Everywhere , and [[Privacy Badger .  === Secure Messaging Scorecard === The EFF has also conducted a project named Secure Messaging Scorecard which ""evaluated apps and tools based on a set of seven specific criteria ranging from whether messages were encrypted in transit to whether or not the code had been recently audited.""<ref name=""auto""></ref> Version 1.0 is accessible [https://www.eff.org/node/82654 here]. , a revised version is under development.<ref name=""auto""/>  ==Support==  [[Charity Navigator  has given the EFF an overall rating of four out of four stars, including four stars for its financial efficiency and capacity.  ===Financial===  EFF  had $23 million in assets,<ref name=FY2014/> having received multiple grants or donations above 1 million dollars in its history. On February 18, 2004, the EFF announced that it had received a [[bequest  of [[United States dollar|US$ 1.2 million from the estate of EFF member Leonard Zubkoff, a software developer and entrepreneur. It used $1 million of this money to establish the EFF Endowment Fund for Digital Civil Liberties.  Beginning in 2010, the EFF began regularly receiving income from the [[Humble Indie Bundle . In 2010, these donations made up 14% of EFF's total revenue.  Between 2011 and 2014, the amount received from [[Humble Bundle  reached $7.5 million or 23% of the EFF total revenues.<ref name=""FY2014""></ref><ref name=""FY2013""></ref><ref name=""FY2012""></ref>  In 2011, the EFF received $1 million from [[Google  as part of a settlement of a class action related to privacy issues involving [[Google Buzz . The [[Electronic Privacy Information Center  and seven other privacy-focused nonprofits protested that the plaintiffs' lawyers and Google had, in effect, arranged to give the majority of those funds ""to organizations that are currently paid by Google to lobby for or to consult for the company."" An additional $1 million was obtained from [[Facebook  in a similar settlement.  In December 2014, the [[Adams Charitable Foundation  granted EFF a $3 million [[Financial endowment|endowment  to fund the new Adams Chair for Internet Rights.<ref name=""FY2014"" />  ===Other===  The [[agitprop  art group Psychological Industries has independently issued buttons with [[popular culture|pop culture  [[Trope  literature |tropes  such as the logo of the Laughing Man from the [[anime  series ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex ''  with the original ''[[The Catcher in the Rye '' quotation replaced with the slogan of [[Anonymous  group |Anonymous  , a bleeding [[Roller derby|roller derby jammer , and the ""[[We Can Do It! "" woman  often misidentified as [[Rosie the Riveter   on a series of buttons on behalf of the EFF.  In late June 2014 the EFF flew a GEFA-FLUG AS 105 GD/4 [[blimp  owned by, and in conjunction with, [[Greenpeace  over the [[NSA 's [[Bluffdale, Utah|Bluffdale -based [[Utah Data Center  in protest against its purported illegal spying.  ==Criticism== [[Yasha Levine , writing for magazine ''[[The Baffler '', described the EFF as [[Astroturfing|astroturf  created and funded by [[Silicon Valley , stating they don't actually defend rights for the users of Internet platforms, instead defending large Internet companies  which are, according to him, EFF's biggest benefactors  by lobbying for said companies' interests and deviating attention from their business practices  especially regarding [[copyright  and [[privacy   to government practices regarding privacy and [[censorship , as well as actually [[lobbying in the United States|lobbying  in ways that actively harm Internet users.  ==See also== <!-- Please keep in alphabetical order & add a short description [[WP:SEEALSO  -->  * [[Clipper chip  * [[Digital rights  * [[European Digital Rights   EDRi  * [[Electronic Frontier Canada  * [[Electronic Frontiers Australia  * [[Freedom of the Press Foundation  * [[Hardware restriction s * [[Information freedom  * [[Internet censorship  * [[League for Programming Freedom  * [[OpenMedia.ca  * [[Open Rights Group ,  UK-based  * [[Protection of Broadcasts and Broadcasting Organizations Treaty  * [[Reporters Without Borders   <!-- Please keep in alphabetical order & add a short description [[WP:SEEALSO  -->  ==Notes==   ==References==  *  *  *  *  *    ==External links==   *  *  **  *  *  also known by the titles:         [[Category:Electronic Frontier Foundation|   [[Category:Access to Knowledge movement  [[Category:Articles containing video clips  [[Category:Charities based in California  [[Category:Civil liberties advocacy groups in the United States  [[Category:Computer law organizations  [[Category:Digital rights organizations  [[Category:Foundations based in the United States  [[Category:Freedom of expression organizations  [[Category:Humble Bundle  [[Category:Intellectual property activism  [[Category:Internet privacy organizations  [[Category:Internet-related activism  [[Category:Mission District, San Francisco  [[Category:Organizations based in San Francisco  [[Category:Organizations established in 1990  [[Category:Politics and technology  [[Category:Privacy in the United States  [[Category:Privacy organizations ","The Electronic Frontier Foundation  EFF  is an international non-profit digital rights group based in San Francisco, California.

EFF provides funds for legal defense in court, presents amicus curiae briefs, defends individuals and new technologies from what it considers abusive legal threats, works to expose government malfeasance, provides guidance to the government and courts, organizes political action and mass mailings, supports some new technologies which it believes preserve personal freedoms and online civil liberties, maintains a database and web sites of related news and information, monitors and challenges potential legislation that it believes would infringe on personal liberties and fair use and solicits a list of what it considers abusive patents with intentions to defeat those that it considers without merit. EFF also provides tips, tools, how-tos, tutorials, and software for safer online communications."

''[[Politico '' founder [[Jim VandeHei  has called the site ""an essential stop for anyone interested in politics.""<ref name=""Chicago Tribune2""></ref> The site is especially noted for its aggregation of polling data during election seasons, which is frequently cited by various media organizations that cover political issues.  == Origin and philosophy ==  === Origin === The web site was founded in 2000 by McIntyre, a former [[trader  finance |trader  at the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange , and Bevan, a former [[advertising agency  [[account executive .<ref name=""Zorn 2004"" />  McIntyre explained ""it really wasn't any more complicated than there should be a place online that pulled together all this quality information"". They call what they do ""intelligent aggregation."" The site has grown in election-season spurts since it first went online. It has expanded from a two-man operation to a full-time staff of more than two-dozen employees overseeing the company's mainstay, RealClearPolitics, as well as ten smaller sites.  === Philosophy === In an interview with the ''[[Chicago Tribune '', McIntyre said, ""We're trying to pull together the best political stories, op-eds, news analyses, editorials out there. The proliferation of content is enormous. Part of what we're trying to do is distill it in a clear, simple way for people who don't have hours to spend searching the Net"".<ref name=""Chicago Tribune""></ref> He told the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times '' that RealClearPolitics strives to feature ""serious intellectual pieces"" and that they're ""not looking for the over-the-top, vitriolic, red-meat craziness on either side"".<ref name=""Chicago Sun-Times""></ref>  Patrick Stack of [[Time  magazine |''Time'' magazine  has described the site's commentary section as ""right-leaning"".<ref name=""rcp100""></ref> The site has been described as being run by conservatives,  and containing ""opinion pieces from multiple media sources"". In 2009 RealClearPolitics was described as a weblog ""in the conservative pantheon"" by Richard Davis.<ref name= davis-2009>Richard Davis, ''Typing Politics: The Role of Blogs in American Politics'' p. 54  2009  [[Oxford University Press  [https://books.google.com/books?id=PWZ2-5wla3MC Google.]</ref>  In an interview with the conservative magazine ''[[Human Events '', McIntyre described the philosophy behind the Web site as based on ""freedom"" and ""common-sense values"". Said Bevan, ""We think debate on the issues is a very important thing. We post a variety of opinions"". He further stated, ""we have a frustration all conservatives have"", which is ""the bias in media against conservatives, religious conservatives, [and] Christian conservatives"".<ref name=""D'Agostino"" />  In a 2001 article for ''[[Princeton Alumni Weekly '', which noted that ""The articles selected invariably demonstrate McIntyre and Bevan's political bent, about which they are unabashedly forthcoming."" McIntyre said, ""I'm not really a die-hard Republican because my interests are less on social issues, more on taxing and spending...  But I definitely don't want the government telling me what to do with my property...  Nevertheless, any political junkie—even a liberal—would enjoy our site because the topics we choose are current.""<ref name=princeton>Rob MacKay, ""Political junkies create Web site for opinion and analysis"" June 6, 2001 ''Princeton Alumni Weekly'' [https://www.princeton.edu/paw/web_exclusives/more/more_20.html Princeton.]</ref>  == Format == Updated continuously, RealClearPolitics' websites aggregate content from a wide range of sources, sources that run the gamut of locations and political persuasions. Stories from the ''[[Washington Post '' and other large-circulation media frequently run alongside articles from such lesser-known papers as the ''[[Ottawa Citizen '', while analyses from the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal  ''[[The New Republic|New Republic '' may be paired with conservative publications such as the ''[[Weekly Standard ''. McIntyre's purported objective is ""to give readers ideological diversity. We're trying to stay immersed in the nation's political bloodstream at all times. That way, we can show you every small, little twist and turn, and give multiple sides to every story"".<ref name=""The New York Sun"" />  == Ownership == [[Forbes  Media LLC bought a 51% equity interest in the site in 2007.<ref name=""forbes""></ref> On May 19, 2015, it was announced that RealClearInvestors and Crest Media bought out Forbes's stake for an undisclosed amount.<ref name=""PR Newsire""></ref><ref name=""PR Newsire""/>  RealClearPolitics also owns RealClearMarkets, RealClearWorld, and RealClearSports. RealClearMarkets and RealClearSports were launched in November 2007. RealClearWorld, the international news and politics site, was launched in August 2008. RealClearScience and RealClearReligion launched in October 2010. RealClearHistory launched in 2012; in 2013 RealClearDefense was launched to cover military, intelligence, and veterans issues.  == Original content == In addition to linking to external content, RealClearPolitics also provides original commentary and reporting, with a staff that includes Carl Cannon, Scott Conroy, [[Erin McPike , Caitlin Huey-Burns, Alexis Simendinger, James Arkin, and [[Sean Trende .  == Political poll averaging == RealClearPolitics aggregates polls for presidential and congressional races into averages, known as the RealClearPolitics average, which are widely cited by media outlets. However, some statisticians say that it is sometimes misleading to average results from multiple polls.<ref name=""wsj_risky""></ref> When [[Nate Silver  of rival site [[FiveThirtyEight.com  claimed RealClearPolitics.com was rigging its averages to favor Senator [[John McCain  and other Republicans, McIntyre denied having a conservative bent, stating, ""We're running a business, We have no interest in screwing around with that for partisan purposes"".<ref name=""silver""></ref> Silver later backed away from the claim and said the two sites had a friendly rivalry and grudging respect for each other.<ref name=""silver"" />  In recent elections, the final Generic Congressional Vote average of polls has underestimated Republican performance. In 2016, Republicans performed 1.7% better than the final RealClearPolitics average,  and in 2014 Republicans performed 3.3% better than the site's average.  In the 2016 Presidential Election, the final RealClearPolitics average margin overestimated Democrat [[Hillary Clinton 's popular vote performance by 1.3%. The final electoral college prediction map produced by RealClearPolitics predicted that she would narrowly win the election with 272 electoral votes. However, she lost the election to Republican [[Donald Trump  in spite of winning the popular vote.   == References ==   == External links == *   [[Category:American websites  [[Category:Internet properties established in 2000  [[Category:2000 establishments in Illinois  [[Category:American political websites  [[Category:News aggregators ","RealClearPolitics  RCP  is a Chicago-based political news and polling data aggregator formed in 2000 by former options trader John McIntyre and former advertising agency account executive Tom Bevan.

341,Y,sltrib.com,"   '''''The Salt Lake Tribune''''' is a daily newspaper published in the city of [[Salt Lake City, Utah , with the largest paid circulation in the state. ''The Tribune'', often referred to as just ""the ''Trib'',"" is owned by Paul Huntsman and printed through  a [[joint operating agreement  with the ''[[Deseret News '' through the [[Newspaper Agency Corporation . For almost 100 years it was a family-owned newspaper held by the heirs of U.S. Senator [[Thomas Kearns . After Kearns died in 1918 the company was controlled by his widow, Jennie Judge Kearns, and then the newspaper's longtime publisher was [[John F. Fitzpatrick , who started his career as secretary to Senator Kearns in 1913 and remained publisher until his death in 1960. John W. Gallivan, nephew to Mrs. Kearns, joined ''The Tribune'' in 1937 and succeeded Fitzpatrick as publisher in 1960 where he remained as Chairman until the merger with TCI, Inc. in 1997.  On April 20, 2016, Huntsman Family Investments, a [[private equity firm  headed by Paul Huntsman, announced that they would be buying the ''Tribune''.  The newspaper's motto, at the top of its masthead, is ""Utah's Independent Voice Since 1871.""  ==History== A successor to ''Utah Magazine''  1868 , as the ''Mormon Tribune'' by a group of businessmen led by former members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints   LDS Church  [[William Godbe , [[Elias L.T. Harrison  and Edward W. Tullidge, who disagreed with the church's economic and political positions. After a year, the publishers changed the name to the ''Salt Lake Daily Tribune and Utah Mining Gazette'', but soon after that, they shortened it to ''The Salt Lake Tribune''.  In 1873 three [[Kansas  businessmen, Frederic Lockley, George F. Prescott and A.M. Hamilton, purchased the company and turned it into an [[Anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormon  newspaper which consistently backed the local [[Liberal Party  Utah |Liberal Party . Sometimes vitriolic, the ''Tribune'' held particular antipathy for LDS Church president [[Brigham Young . In the edition announcing Young's death, the ''Tribune'' wrote, :He was illiterate and he has made frequent boast that he never saw the inside of a school house. His habit of mind was singularly illogical and his public addresses the greatest farrago of nonsense that ever was put in print. He prided himself on being a great financer, and yet all of his commercial speculations have been conspicuous failures. He was hierophant, and pretended to be in daily [communion] with the Almighty, and yet he was groveling in his ideas, and the system of religion he formulated was well nigh Satanic. &mdash; ''The Salt Lake Tribune'', August 30, 1877  In 1901 newly elected [[United States Senate|United States Senator  [[Thomas Kearns , a [[Roman Catholic , and his business partner, David Keith, secretly bought the ''Tribune''. Kearns made strides to eliminate the paper's anti-Mormon overtones, and succeeded in maintaining good relationships with the mostly-LDS state legislature which had elected him to the [[United States Senate|Senate . After Keith died in 1918 the Kearns family bought out Keith's share of the Salt Lake Tribune Publishing Company. Eventually, the parent company became Kearns-Tribune Corporation.  In 1902 the company started up an evening edition, known as ''The Salt Lake Telegram''. ''The Telegram'' was sold in 1914 and reacquired by the ''Tribune'' in 1930. It was phased out when the joint operating agreement was formed with the afternoon ''[[Deseret News '', Salt Lake's daily newspaper owned by the LDS Church, in 1952.  [[File:Salt Lake Tribune marquis.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Marquee of ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' on the Tribune Building in [[Downtown  Salt Lake City |Downtown  [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City   John F. Fitzpatrick became publisher in 1924, ushering in what became seven decades of peaceful coexistence with the dominant LDS Church. In 1952 the''Tribune'' entered into a joint operating agreement with the ''Deseret News'' and created the [[Newspaper Agency Corporation .  Fitzpatrick was the architect of NAC at the request of Mormon Church President David O. McKay whose newspaper was near bankruptcy at the time. In 1960 Fitzpatrick died of a heart attack and was succeeded by [[John W. Gallivan  who had been trained as the next publisher since he joined ''The Tribune'' in 1937. Gallivan often joked with aspiring journalism students telling them the best way to the publisher's desk was to get yourself left on the doorstep of the owner.  Gallivan was orphaned at age 5, then taken in by his mother's half-sister, Mrs.Thomas Kearns.  In the late 1950s, in spite of reluctance from John Fitzpatrick about the future of television, Gallivan joined a measured Tribune investment with The Standard Corporation in Ogden to build one of the first microwave and cable TV systems across northern Nevada. Gallivan traveled weekends by bus to Elko, NV to oversee the construction beginnings. Gallivan and Denver cable investor Bob Magness merged their companies into Tele-Communications, Inc.  TCI  which eventually became the largest cable television company in the world. ''The Tribune's'' ownership interest in TCI reached nearly 15% which played a large role in later mergers between the two companies. Gallivan remained in ''The Tribune'' publisher position until 1984 and chairman of the board until 1997.  The Kearns family owned a majority share of the newspaper until 1997 when  merged with [[Tele-Communications Inc.  in an effort to minimize inheritance tax liabilities borne by the two largest shareholders in the Kearns family. A buy-back agreement was put in place providing for the Kearns family to reacquire ''The Tribune'' after an IRS required 5-year holding period. In the interim however, TCI was merged with AT&T Corporation. After intense pressure from the LDS Church, and intense counter-suits from the Kearns family,''The'' ''Tribune'' was subsequently sold by AT&T to [[Denver, Colorado -based [[MediaNews Group  in 2000.s  In 2002 the ''Tribune'' was mired in controversy after employees sold information related to the [[Elizabeth Smart kidnapping  case to ''The National Enquirer.'' ''Tribune'' editor James ""Jay"" Shelledy resigned from his job at the paper amidst the fallout of the scandal. Two staffers also were removed from their positions as ''Tribune'' reporters.  In 2004 the paper decided to move from its historic location at the [[downtown  Salt Lake City |downtown  Tribune building, to [[The Gateway  Salt Lake City |The Gateway  development. Many people, including several ''Tribune'' employees, opposed the move, stating that it would harm the economy of Salt Lake's downtown. The move was completed in May 2005 and ''Tribune'' employees were told by Editor Nancy Conway, ""It is just a building.""  After emerging from bankruptcy in 2010, MediaNews Group lost control of its ownership to a hedge fund, [[Alden Global Capital . ""The remainder of the Denver-based chain is owned by a consortium of lenders and by Singleton himself."" In 2016, Huntsman Family Investments, LLC, a company controlled by Paul Huntsman, bought ''The Salt Lake Tribune''. Paul Huntsman is the son of industrialist [[Jon Huntsman, Sr.  who serves as chairman of the holding company, and brother of former Utah governor and ambassador to Russia [[Jon Huntsman, Jr. .  In 2012, as it had in 2008, ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' endorsed [[Barack Obama  for the presidency, despite opponent [[Mitt Romney 's connections with both Mormonism and Salt Lake City, having had a hand in organizing their 2002 Olympic Games.  In 2017, ''Tribune'' was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting for ""a string of vivid reports revealing the perverse, punitive and cruel treatment given to sexual assault victims at Brigham Young University, one of Utah’s most powerful institutions."" The team included lead reporter Erin Alberty, managing editor Sheila R. McCann, reporters Jessica Miller and Alex Stuckey and editor/writer Rachel Piper. The package of winning stories also included an investigation into multiple reports that were not properly investigated by Utah State University.     In a December 2017 editorial, the ''Tribune'' called for Utah Senator [[Orrin Hatch  to retire in 2018.  In May 2018, the ''Tribune'' laid off over one third of its staff of 90, bringing the number to 56. The reason put forward for this is lower revenue due to decreased circulation and lower profit from online advertisements. This is despite the paywall placed on the ''Tribune'' website months before.  ==See also==  * [[Harold Schindler  – Historian, television screenwriter and editor for ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' * [[Peggy Fletcher Stack  – Religion reporter for ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' * [[Robert Kirby  humor columnist |Robert Kirby  – Humor columnist for ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' * [[Florabel Muir  - First female reporter for ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' * [[Frank Hewlett  - Washington bureau chief  ==References==  ===Sources=== *   ==Further reading== *  *   ==External links==  *  * [https://web.archive.org/web/20120113041952/http://m.sltrib.com/ ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' mobile website]    [[Category:1871 establishments in Utah Territory  [[Category:Companies based in Salt Lake City  [[Category:Media in Salt Lake City  [[Category:MediaNews Group publications  [[Category:Mormonism-related controversies  [[Category:Newspapers published in Utah  [[Category:Publications established in 1871 ","The Salt Lake Tribune is a daily newspaper published in the city of Salt Lake City, Utah, with the largest paid circulation in the state.

Local radio stations [[WDWS , WKIO and [[WHMS  are owned by News-Gazette Media as well.  == History == The paper traces its history to the '''''Urbana Union''''', founded in 1852.  By the turn of the century, it had moved to Champaign and become the '''''Champaign Daily News.'''''  In 1919, David W. Stevick, owner and publisher of the '''''Daily News''''', bought the '''''Champaign Daily Gazette''''' and merged them into the current paper.  He died in 1935 and passed it to his widow, Helen M. Stevick.  Helen died in 1967 and was succeeded by her daughter, Marajen Stevick Chinigo, who ran the paper until her death in 2002.  In 1979, the paper's longtime rival, the ''[[Champaign-Urbana Courier '', ceased publication. This left Champaign with only one daily newspaper for the first time. The two papers had long been equally alike, as both were afternoon newspapers. The Courier focused on news specifically from Urbana.  From its founding until June 2009, The News-Gazette published its main edition in the afternoon. The paper was well known in the area as being one of the only afternoon papers left. Beginning in the late 1990s, the paper printed an edition specifically geared towards Champaign and Urbana that was published in the morning. Due to the decreasing revenue from print advertising, ''The News-Gazette'' switched to morning publication only on June 1, 2009.  Since 1937, it has been co-owned with the area's oldest commercial radio station, [[WDWS .  An FM sister was added in 1949; it is now [[WHMS . Another rock station, WUIL  now [[WKIO  , was purchased in May 2010.  ''The News-Gazette'' has a circulation ranging from 22,000–30,000  depending on the day of the week .

The News-Gazette has consistently been an Illinois Press Association award-winning newspaper for editorial and advertising excellence.   Since 2008, The News-Gazette's advertising department has been awarded the Illinois Press Association's Annual James S. Copley Memorial Sweepstakes Award for Daily Newspaper Advertising Excellence 6 times.  This is considered to be the top honor available and is awarded for overall excellence in advertising.    ''The News-Gazette'' often prints special reports or series from [[Associated Press  writers about the state or national government.  The newspaper's website  www.news-gazette.com  is the most viewed commercial website in East Central Illinois.  It is viewed by around 30,000-35,000 unique visitors a day, and receives 3.5 million page views per month.  On April 11, 2017, The News-Gazette announced plans to phase out its local printing and packaging operations by mid-summer 2017.

The editor, owner and chief reporter of ''The Critic'' was Samuel S. Woolever.  In what would become a family dynasty that would oversee the company for four decades, in 1894 [[Muhlenberg College  senior David A. Miller went to work for ''The Critic'' as its sole reporter. Its owners were Charles Weiser, editor, and Kirt W. DeBelle, business manager.  A reader contest was involved in the naming of the newspaper when, in late 1894, the company said that a school boy or girl in [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County  would receive $5 in gold if he or she could guess the publication's new name. The identity of the lucky winner is lost to history, but on Jan. 1, 1895, Allentown City Treasurer A.L. Reichenbach, who had supervised the contest, read out the new name: ""''The Morning Call''.""  That same year, David A. Miller and his brother Samuel Miller were able to purchase their first shares of ''The Morning Call''. It was the start of a series of stock buyouts that would leave the newspaper entirely in the hands of the Miller brothers by 1904. In that nine-year period, the Miller brothers worked to gather subscribers. In one case, David A. Miller even attended a corn husking party and had every family there signed up by the time he left.  By 1920, [[World War I  and the work of the Millers had raised circulation to 20,000. A series of newspaper mergers that year, funded by [[Harry Clay Trexler|Gen. Harry Clay Trexler , led to the Millers' sale of ''The Morning Call'' to the Trexler interests. It was only after Trexler's death in 1933, and at the urging of David A. Miller's sons, Donald P. and Samuel W., that David A. Miller returned to the newspaper in 1934. In 1935 ''The Morning Call'' acquired the sole remaining Allentown newspaper, the ''Chronicle and News'', and renamed it the ''Evening Chronicle''. In 1938 the ''Sunday Call-Chronicle'' was first published.  In 1951, David A. Miller assumed the official title of president of the Call-Chronicle newspapers. He would keep that post until his death in 1958 at the age of 88. That September his sons, Donald and Samuel, were named publishers. After Samuel's death in 1967, Donald P. Miller continued to run the newspaper. He did so with his son, Edward D. Miller, until the late 1970s when Edward became executive editor and publisher.  The ''Evening Chronicle'' went to press for the last time in 1980. In 1981 Edward D. Miller left the newspaper, and Donald P. Miller returned as chairman. The publisher and chief executive officer was Bernard C. Stinner. They retained control of the newspaper until 1984, when it was sold to [[Times Mirror Company|The Times Mirror Company , joining the ''[[Los Angeles Times '', ''[[Newsday '', ''[[The Baltimore Sun '', the ''[[Hartford Courant '' and Southern Connecticut Newspapers Inc., publishers of the ''[[The Advocate  Stamford |Stamford Advocate '' and ''[[Greenwich Time  newspaper |Greenwich Times ''.

The researchers found a correlation between a higher CPI and higher long-term economic growth, as well as an increase in [[GDP  growth of 1.7% for every unit increase in a country's CPI score. Also shown was a [[power-law  dependence linking higher CPI score to higher rates of foreign investment in a country.  == Rankings == Legend: {| class=""wikitable"" ! rowspan=2 | Scores ! colspan=5 |

According to political scientist Dan Hough, three flaws in the Index include: * Corruption is too complex to be captured by a single score. The nature of corruption in rural Kansas will, for instance, be different from that in the city administration of New York, yet the Index measures them in the same way. * By measuring perceptions of corruption, as opposed to corruption itself, the Index may simply be reinforcing stereotypes and cliches. * The Index only measures public-sector corruption, leaving out private actors. This for instance means the [[Libor scandal  or the [[Volkswagen emissions scandal|VW emissions scandal  are not counted. Media outlets frequently use the raw numbers as a yardstick for government performance, without clarifying what the numbers mean. The local Transparency International chapter in [[Bangladesh  disowned the index results after a change in methodology caused the country's scores to increase; media reported it as an ""improvement"".  In a 2013 article in ''[[Foreign Policy  magazine |Foreign Policy '', Alex Cobham suggested that CPI should be dropped for the good of Transparency International. It argues that the CPI embeds a powerful and misleading elite bias in popular perceptions of corruption, potentially contributing to a vicious cycle and at the same time incentivizing inappropriate policy responses. Cobham writes, ""the index corrupts perceptions to the extent that it's hard to see a justification for its continuing publication.""<ref name=""Cobham, Alex""></ref>  However, recent econometric analyses that have exploited the existence of natural experiments on the level of corruption and compared the CPI with other subjective indicators have found that, while not perfect, the CPI is argued to be broadly consistent with one-dimensional measures of corruption.  In the United States, many lawyers advise international businesses to consult the CPI when attempting to measure the risk of [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  violations in different nations. This practice has been criticized by the ''Minnesota Journal of International Law'', which wrote that since the CPI may be subject to perceptual biases it therefore should not be considered by lawyers to be a measure of actual national corruption risk.<ref name=""ssrn.com"">Campbell, Stuart Vincent.

It was founded in 1865 as ''The Daily Dramatic Chronicle'' by teenage brothers [[Charles de Young  and [[M. H. de Young|Michael H. de Young . The paper is currently owned by the [[Hearst Corporation , which bought it from the de Young family in 2000. It is the only major daily paper covering the city and county of San Francisco.  The paper benefited from the growth of [[San Francisco  and was the largest circulation newspaper on the [[West Coast of the United States  by 1880. Like many other newspapers, it has experienced a rapid fall in circulation in the early 21st century, and was ranked 24th by circulation nationally for the six months to March 2010. The newspaper publishes two web sites: and '''''sfchronicle.com''''', which closely reflects the articles that appear in the print paper, and '''''SFGate''''', which has a mixture of online news and web features.    ==History== The ''Chronicle'' was founded by brothers [[Charles de Young|Charles  and [[M. H. de Young  in 1865 as ''The Daily Dramatic Chronicle'', and inside of 10 years, it had the largest circulation of any newspaper west of the Mississippi River. The paper's first office was in a building at the corner of Bush and Kearney Streets. The brothers then commissioned a building from [[Burnham and Root  at 690 Market Street at the corner of Third and Kearney Streets to be their new headquarters, in what became known as [[Newspaper Row  San Francisco |Newspaper Row . The new building, San Francisco's first skyscraper, was completed in 1889.  It was damaged in the 1906 earthquake, but it was rebuilt under the direction of William Polk, Burnham's associate in San Francisco. That building, known as the ""Old Chronicle Building"" or the ""DeYoung Building"", still stands and was restored in 2007. It is an historic landmark and is the location of the Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences.<ref name=spur />  In 1924, the ''Chronicle'' commissioned a new headquarters at 901 Mission Street on the corner of 5th Street in what is now the South of Market  SoMa  neighborhood of San Francisco. It was designed by Charles Peter Weeks and William Peyton Day in the [[Gothic Revival architecture  style, but most of the Gothic Revival detailing was removed in 1968 when the building was re-clad with stucco. This building remains the Chronicle's headquarters in 2017, although other concerns are located there as well.<ref name=spur />  Between [[World War II  and 1971, new editor [[Scott Newhall  took a bold and somewhat provocative approach to news presentation. Newhall's ''Chronicle'' included investigative reporting by such journalists as [[Pierre Salinger , who later played a prominent role in national politics, and [[Paul Avery , the staffer who pursued the trail of the self-named ""[[Zodiac Killer "", who sent a [[cryptogram  in three sections in letters to the ''Chronicle'' and two other papers during his murder spree in the late 1960s. It also featured such colorful columnists as [[Pauline Phillips , who wrote under the name ""[[Dear Abby ,"" ""Count Marco""  Marc Spinelli , [[Stanton Delaplane , Terence O'Flaherty, [[Lucius Beebe , [[Art Hoppe ,  [[Charles McCabe , and [[Herb Caen .  The newspaper grew in circulation to become the city's largest, overtaking the rival ''[[San Francisco Examiner ''. The demise of other San Francisco dailies through the late 1950s and early 1960s left the ''Examiner'' and the ''Chronicle'' to battle for circulation and readership superiority.  ===Joint operating agreement  JOA ===  The competition between the ''Chronicle'' and ''Examiner'' took a financial toll on both papers until the summer of 1965, when a merger of sorts created a [[Joint Operating Agreement  under which the ''Chronicle'' became the city's sole morning daily while the ''Examiner'' changed to afternoon publication  which ultimately led to a declining readership .  The newspapers were officially owned by the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, which managed sales and distribution for both newspapers and was charged with ensuring that one newspaper's circulation did not grow at the expense of the other. Revenue was split equally, which led to a situation widely understood to benefit the ''Examiner'', since the ''Chronicle'', which had a circulation four times larger than its rival, subsidized the afternoon newspaper.<ref name=""AJRBattle1"">Gorney, Cynthia Gorney  January/February 1999 . [http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3293 ""The State of The American Newspaper - The Battle Of the Bay""]. ajr.org. ''[[American Journalism Review ''. Retrieved 2012-11-17.</ref>  The two newspapers produced a joint Sunday edition, with the ''Examiner'' publishing the news sections and the Sunday magazine and the ''Chronicle'' responsible for the tabloid entertainment section and the book review. From 1965 on the two papers shared a single classified-advertising operation. This arrangement stayed in place until the Hearst Corporation took full control of the ''Chronicle'' in 2000.  ===Push into the suburbs=== [[File:Jack Breibart and Bill German.jpg|thumb|250px|Bill German  left , the ''Chronicle''s editor emeritus, and page-one editor Jack Breibart in the newsroom, March 1994   Beginning in the early 1990s, the ''Chronicle'' started to face competition beyond the borders of San Francisco. The newspaper had long enjoyed a wide reach as the de facto ""newspaper of record"" in Northern California, with distribution along the Central Coast, the Inland Empire and even as far as Honolulu, Hawaii. There was little competition in the Bay Area suburbs and other areas that the newspaper served, but as Knight Ridder consolidated the San Jose Mercury News in 1975; purchased Contra Costa Times in 1995; and while Media News Group  Denver  purchased all other East Bay newspapers by 1985, the ''Chronicle'' realized it had to step up its suburban coverage.  The ''Chronicle'' launched five zoned sections to appear in the Friday edition of the paper. The sections covered San Francisco, and four different suburban areas. They each featured a unique columnist, enterprise pieces and local news specific to the community. The newspaper added 40 full-time staff positions to work in the suburban bureaus. Despite the push to focus on suburban coverage, the ''Chronicle'' was hamstrung by the Sunday edition, which, being produced by the San Francisco-centric ""un-''Chronicle''"" ''Examiner'', had none of the focus on the suburban communities that the ''Chronicle'' was striving to cultivate.<ref name=""AJRBattle2""></ref>  ===Sale to Hearst===  The de Young family controlled the paper, via the [[Chronicle Publishing Company , until July 27, 2000, when it was sold to [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Communications, Inc. , which owned the ''Examiner''. Following the sale, the Hearst Corporation transferred the ''Examiner'' to the Fang family, publisher of the ''[[San Francisco Independent '' and ''[[AsianWeek '', along with a $66-million subsidy.<ref name=""subsidy""></ref> Under the new owners, the ''Examiner'' became a free [[Tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid , leaving the ''Chronicle'' as the only daily [[broadsheet  newspaper in San Francisco.  In 1949, the de Young family founded [[KRON-TV   Channel 4 , the Bay Area's third television station. Until the mid-1960s, the station  along with KRON-FM , operated from the basement of the Chronicle Building, on Mission Street. KRON moved to studios at 1001 Van Ness Avenue  on the former site of St. Mary's Cathedral, which burned down in 1962 . KRON was sold to [[Young Broadcasting  in 2000 and, after years of being San Francisco's [[NBC  affiliate, became an independent station on January 1, 2002 when NBC—tired of Chronicle's repeated refusal to sell KRON to the network and, later, Young's asking price for the station being too high—purchased [[KNTV  in San Jose from [[Granite Broadcasting Corporation  for $230 million.<ref name=""KNTV""></ref>  [[File:JOHNSIAS1999.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Chronicle'' CEO John Sias announces the sale of the newspaper to the [[Hearst Corporation , August 6, 1999   Since the Hearst Corporation took ownership in 2000 the ''Chronicle'' has made periodic changes to its organization and design, but on February 1, 2009, as the newspaper began its 145th year of publication, the ''Chronicle'' Sunday edition introduced a redesigned paper featuring a modified logo, new section and page organization, new features, bolder, colored section-front banners and new headline and text typography. The frequent bold-faced, all-capital-letter headlines typical of the ''Chronicle'''s front page were eliminated. Editor Ward Bushee's note heralded the issue as the start of a ""new era"" for the ''Chronicle''.  On July 6, 2009, the paper unveiled some alterations to the new design that included yet newer section fronts and wider use of color photographs and graphics. In a special section publisher Frank J. Vega described new, state-of-the-art printing operations enabling the production of what he termed ""A Bolder, Brighter ''Chronicle''.""  The newer look was accompanied by a reduction in size of the broadsheet. Such moves are similar to those made by other prominent American newspapers such as the ''[[Chicago Tribune '' and ''[[Orlando Sentinel '', which in 2008 unveiled radically new designs even as changing reader demographics and general economic conditions necessitated physical reductions of the newspapers.  On November 9, 2009, the ''Chronicle'' became the first newspaper in the nation to print on high-quality glossy paper. The high-gloss paper is used for some section fronts and inside pages.  ==Staff== [[File:MATIER&ROSS.jpg|thumb|250px|""Chronicle Insider"" columnists Phil Matier and Andrew Ross in the newsroom   As of 2018 the publisher of the ''Chronicle'' is Bill Nagel.

''San Francisco Chronicle''. Retrieved 2012-11-17.</ref> As well as publishing the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' online, SFGate and SFChronicle.com add other features not available in the [[Publishing|print  version, such as blogs and podcasts. SFGate was one of the earliest major market newspaper websites to be launched, having done so in 1994, at the time of [[The Newspaper Guild  [[San Francisco newspaper strike of 1994|strike ; meanwhile the union published its own news website, ''San Francisco Free Press''. SFGate is the fifth largest newspaper website in America with over 33 million unique visitors each month.  ==Praise, criticism and features== The paper has received the [[Pulitzer Prize  on a number of occasions. Despite an illustrious and long history, the paper's news reportage is not as extensive as in the past. The current day ''Chronicle'' has followed the trend of other American newspapers, devoting increasing attention to local and regional news and cultural and entertainment criticism to the detriment of the paper's traditionally strong national and international reporting, though the paper does maintain a Washington, D.C., bureau. This increased focus on local news is a response to the competition from other Bay Area newspapers including the resurrected ''[[San Francisco Examiner '', the ''[[Oakland Tribune '', the ''[[Contra Costa Times '' and the ''[[San Jose Mercury News ''.  [[Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada  received the [[George Polk Awards|2004 George Polk Award  for Sports Reporting.<ref name=""polk""></ref>  Fainaru-Wada and Williams were recognized for their work on uncovering the [[BALCO  scandal, which linked [[San Francisco Giants  star [[Barry Bonds  to performance-enhancing drugs. While the two above-named reporters broke the news, they are by no means the only sports writers of note at the ''Chronicle''. The ''Chronicle''s sports section, edited by Al Saracevic and called ''Sporting Green'' as it is printed on green-tinted pages, is staffed by a dozen writers. The section's best-known writers are its columnists: Bruce Jenkins, Ann Killion, Scott Ostler, Saracevic and Tom Stienstra. Its baseball coverage is anchored by Henry Schulman, John Shea and [[Susan Slusser , the first female president of the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America   BBWAA .  Another area of note is the architecture column by John King; the Chronicle is still one of the few American papers to present a regular column on architectural issues. The paper also has regular weekly sections devoted to Food & Home and Style.  ==Challenges== Circulation has fallen sharply since the heyday of the [[dot-com bubble|dot-com boom  from 1997 to 2001. The ''Chronicle'''s daily readership dropped by 16.6% between 2004 and 2005 to 400,906;<ref name=""circulation""></ref> The ''Chronicle'' fired one quarter of its newsroom staff in a cost-cutting move in May 2007. Newspaper executives pointed to growth of SFGate, the online website with 5.2 million unique visitors per month - fifth among U.S. newspaper websites in 2007.  In February 2009, Hearst chief executive Frank A. Bennack Jr., and Hearst President Steven R. Swartz, announced that the ''Chronicle'' had lost money every year since 2001 and more than $50 million in 2008. Without major concessions from employees and other cuts, Hearst would put the papers up for sale and if no buyer was found, shut the paper. San Francisco would have become the first major American city without a daily newspaper. The cuts were made.  In spite of, or perhaps because of the threats, the loss of readers and advertisers accelerated. On October 26, 2009, the Audit Bureau of Circulations reported that the ''Chronicle'' had suffered a 25.8% drop in circulation for the six-month period ending September 2009, to 251,782 subscribers, the largest percentage drop in circulation of any major newspaper in the United States.<ref name=""circulation_oct_09""></ref>  ''Chronicle'' publisher Frank Vega said the drop was expected as the paper moved to earn more from higher subscription fees from fewer readers.<ref name=""circulation_oct_09_02""></ref> In May 2013, Vega retired and was replaced as publisher by former ''Los Angeles Times'' publisher Jeffrey M. Johnson. SFGate, the main digital portal for the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', registered 19 million unique visitors in January 2015, making it the seventh ranked newspaper website in the United States.   ==Publishers== * [[M.

Johnson employed him as a summer [[intern  and eventually promoted him to manage Johnson's personal mail. Soon after, Moyers transferred to the [[University of Texas at Austin , where he wrote for ''[[The Daily Texan '' newspaper. In 1956, he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts  degree in Journalism. While in Austin, Moyers served as assistant news editor for KTBC [[KLBJ-AM|radio  and [[KTBC  TV |television  stations, owned by [[Lady Bird Johnson , wife of then-Senator Johnson. During the academic year 1956–1957, he studied issues of church and state at the [[University of Edinburgh  in [[Scotland  as a [[Rotary International#Exchanges and scholarships|Rotary International Fellow . In 1959, he completed a [[Master of Divinity  degree at the [[Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary  in [[Fort Worth , Texas.<ref name=""MBC"" /> Moyers served as Director of Information while attending SWBTS. He was also a Baptist pastor in [[Weir, Texas|Weir  in [[Williamson County, Texas|Williamson County , near Austin.  Moyers was [[ordination|ordained  in 1954. Moyers planned to enter a [[Doctor of Philosophy  program in American Studies at the University of Texas. During Senator Johnson's unsuccessful bid for the [[Democratic Party  United States  presidential primaries, 1960|1960 Democratic U.S. presidential nomination , Moyers served as a top aide, and in the general campaign he acted as liaison between [[Democratic Party  United States |Democratic  [[United States Vice President|vice-presidential  candidate Johnson and the Democratic [[United States presidential election, 1960|presidential nominee , U.S. Senator [[John F. Kennedy .<ref name=""library""></ref>  ===Kennedy and Johnson administrations=== During the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy Administration , Moyers was first appointed as associate director of public affairs for the newly created [[Peace Corps  in 1961. He served as Deputy Director from 1962 to 1963.  When [[Lyndon B. Johnson  took office after the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy assassination , Moyers became a special assistant to Johnson, serving from 1963 to 1967. Moyers is the last surviving person identifiable in the photograph taken of Johnson's [[First inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson#Love Field, Dallas|first inauguration on Air Force One . He played a key role in organizing and supervising the 1964 [[Great Society  legislative task forces and was a principal architect of Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign. Moyers acted as the President's informal chief of staff from October 1964 until 1966. From July 1965 to February 1967, he also served as [[White House press secretary .<ref name=""library""/>  After the resignation of White House Chief of Staff [[Walter Jenkins  because of a sexual misdemeanor in the run up to the [[U.S. presidential election, 1964|1964 election , President [[Lyndon B. Johnson , alarmed that the opposition was framing the issue as a security breach,<ref name=""lavender""></ref> ordered Moyers to request [[FBI Name Check|FBI name checks  on 15 members of [[Barry Goldwater|Goldwater's  staff to find ""derogatory"" material on their personal lives.<ref name=""fbi""></ref> Goldwater himself only referred to the Jenkins incident off the record.<ref name=""LBJportrait""></ref> The [[Church Committee  stated in 1975 that ""Moyers has publicly recounted his role in the incident, and his account is confirmed by FBI documents.""<ref name=""aarclib1""></ref> In 2005, [[Laurence H. Silberman|Laurence Silberman  claimed that Moyers denied writing the memo in a 1975 phone call. Moyers said he had a different recollection of the telephone conversation.  Moyers also sought information from the FBI on the sexual preferences of White House staff members, most notably [[Jack Valenti . Moyers indicated his memory was unclear on why Johnson directed him to request such information, ""but that he may have been simply looking for details of allegations first brought to the president by [[J. Edgar Hoover|Hoover .""<ref name=""ValentiInvestigation""></ref>  Moyers approved  but had nothing to do with the production  of the infamous ""[[Daisy  advertisement |Daisy Ad "" against [[Barry Goldwater  in the 1964 presidential campaign.<ref name=""GoldwaterObit""></ref> Goldwater blamed him for it, and once said of Moyers, ""Every time I see him, I get sick to my stomach and want to throw up.""  The ad is considered the starting point of the modern-day harshly negative campaign ad.<ref name=""SchwartzObit""></ref>  [[Image:MoyersPress-small.jpg|270px|thumbnail|right|Moyers giving a press conference at the [[White House  in 1965  Journalist [[Morley Safer  in his 1990 book ""Flashbacks"" wrote that Moyers and President Johnson met with and ""harangued"" Safer's boss, [[CBS  president [[Frank Stanton  executive |Frank Stanton , about Safer's coverage of the Marines torching [[Cam Ne  village in the [[Vietnam War .<ref name=""safer1""></ref> During the meeting, Safer alleges, Johnson threatened to expose Safer's ""communist ties"". This was a bluff, according to Safer. Safer says that Moyers was ""if not a key player, certainly a key bystander"" in the incident. Moyers stated that his hard-hitting coverage of conservative presidents [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan  and [[George H. W. Bush|Bush  were behind Safer's 1990 allegations.  In ''[[The New York Times '' on April 3, 1966, Moyers offered this insight on his stint as press secretary to President Johnson: ""I work for him despite his faults and he lets me work for him despite my deficiencies.""<ref name=""numbertwotexan""></ref><ref name=""simpsonsquotations""></ref> On October 17, 1967, he told an audience in Cambridge that Johnson saw the war in Vietnam as his major legacy and, as a result, was insisting on victory at all costs, even in the face of public opposition. Moyers felt such a continuation of the conflict would tear the country apart. ""I never thought the situation could arise when I would wish for the defeat of LBJ, and that makes my current state of mind all the more painful to me,"" he told them. ""I would have to say now: It would depend on who his opponent is.""  The full details of his rift with Johnson have not been made public but may be discussed in a forthcoming memoir.<ref name=""pulpitwithsermons""></ref>  Moyers has consistently refused to discuss his experience in the Johnson administration with Robert A. Caro, Johnson's most famous biographer.  ===Journalism===  ====''Newsday''==== Moyers served as publisher for the [[Long Island, New York  daily newspaper ''[[Newsday '' from 1967 to 1970. The conservative publication had been unsuccessful,<ref name=""CHAH"">""Bill Moyers."" Contemporary Heroes and Heroines, Book IV. Gale Group, 2000. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2010.</ref> but Moyers led the paper in a progressive direction,<ref name=""encyc""></ref> bringing in leading writers such as [[Pete Hamill , [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan , and [[Saul Bellow , and adding new features and more investigative reporting and analysis. Circulation increased and the publication won 33 major journalism awards, including two [[Pulitzer Prize s.<ref name=""CHAH""/> But the owner of the paper, [[Harry Guggenheim , a conservative, was disappointed by the liberal drift of the newspaper under Moyers, criticizing the ""left-wing"" coverage of Vietnam War protests.<ref name=""time42770""></ref><ref name=""keeler""></ref> The two split over the 1968 presidential election, with Guggenheim signing an editorial supporting [[Richard Nixon , when Moyers supported [[Hubert Humphrey . Guggenheim sold his majority share to the then-conservative [[Times-Mirror Company  over the attempt of newspaper employees to block the sale, even though Moyers offered $10 million more than the Times-Mirror purchase price; Moyers resigned a few days later.<ref name=""pulpitwithsermons""/><ref name=""time42770""/><ref name=""nyt51370""></ref><ref name=""raymont313""></ref>  ====''Bill Moyers Journal''==== In 1971 he began working for the Public Broadcasting System  [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS  , hosting a [[news program  called ''[[Bill Moyers Journal '', which ran until 1981 with a hiatus from 1976 to 1977, and then again from 2007 to 2010.<ref name=""mbcprofile""></ref>  ====CBS News==== In 1976 he moved to [[CBS , where he worked as editor and chief correspondent for ''CBS Reports'' until 1980, then as senior news analyst and commentator for the ''[[CBS Evening News  with [[Dan Rather '' from 1981 to 1986. He was the last regular commentator for the network broadcast.<ref name=""opinionsdifferoncbs""></ref> During his last year at CBS, Moyers made public statements about declining news standards at the network and declined to renew his contract with CBS, citing commitments with PBS.  ====''The Power of Myth'' series==== In 1986 Moyers and his wife, Judith Suzanne Davidson Moyers, formed ''Public Affairs Television''. Among their first productions was the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS  1988 documentary series ''[[The Power of Myth|Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth '', consisting of six one-hour interviews between Moyers and mythologist [[Joseph Campbell . The documentary covers Campbell's exploration of the [[monomyth  and the [[hero cycle , or the story of the hero, as it manifests itself in various cultures. Campbell's influence is clearly seen in the work of [[George Lucas 's ''[[Star Wars '' saga. In the first interview, filmed at George Lucas' ""[[Skywalker Ranch "",<ref name=""herosadventure""></ref> Moyers and Campbell discuss the relationship between Campbell's theories and Lucas's creative work. Twelve years after the making of ''The Power of Myth'', Moyers and Lucas met again for the 1999 interview, the ''Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas & Bill Moyers'', to further discuss the impact of Campbell's work on Lucas's films.<ref name=""dvdlucas""></ref>  ====''The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crisis''==== In 1987 Moyers produced and hosted a scathing documentary, ''The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crisis'', covering the infringement on the limitations on government and the executive branch provided by the Constitution. It considered U.S. foreign policy and militarism historically and recently, centering on the [[Iran–Contra affair . It was harshly rebuked by conservatives and continuing into the 1990s was used by [[Republican Party  United States |Republicans  as a reason to threaten the funding of the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting  and PBS.  ====''In Search of the Constitution''==== Also in 1987 Moyers produced an 11-part documentary celebrating the bicentennial of the signing of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution  and critically analyzing the present state of affairs and the intervening 200 years. Four episodes of ''In Search of the Constitution'' were interviews of sitting [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court  [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|justices  and the remainder contained discussions with prominent scholars. The miniseries was produced by [[Madeline Amgott .<ref name=variety></ref>  ====''A World of Ideas''==== In 1988, Moyers produced an interview series featuring writers, artists, philosophers, scientists, and historians he had become acquainted with. The series broke new ground for national television by bringing thoughtful, intelligent, provocative, and noteworthy people to the screen, most of whom had little prior exposure in the mass media. The series was revived in 1990. Moyers published companion books for both the first series and the second.  ====NBC News==== Moyers briefly joined [[NBC News  in 1995 as a senior analyst and commentator, and the following year he became the first host of sister cable network [[MSNBC 's ''Insight'' program. He was the last regular commentator on the ''[[NBC Nightly News ''.<ref name=""opinionsdifferoncbs""/>  ====''NOW with Bill Moyers''==== Moyers hosted the TV news journal ''[[NOW with Bill Moyers '' on PBS for three years, starting in January 2002. He retired from the program on December 17, 2004, but returned to PBS soon after to host ''[[Wide Angle  PBS series |Wide Angle '' in 2005. When he left ''NOW'', he announced that he wished to finish writing a biography of [[Lyndon B. Johnson .<ref name=""toleavepbs""></ref>  ====''Faith and Reason''==== In 2006, he presented two public television series. ''Faith and Reason'', a series of conversations with esteemed writers of various faiths and of no faith, explored the question ""In a world in which religion is poison to some and salvation to others, how do we live together?""  ====''Moyers on America''==== The series, ''Moyers on America'', analyzed in depth the ramifications of three important issues: the [[Jack Abramoff  scandal, evangelical religion and environmentalism  [[Evangelical environmentalism  , and threats to open public access of the Internet.  ====''Bill Moyers Journal''==== On April 25, 2007, Moyers returned to PBS with ''[[Bill Moyers Journal ''. In the first episode, ""Buying the War"", Moyers investigated what he called the general media's shortcomings in the runup to the [[Iraq War|War in Iraq .  On November 20, 2009, Moyers announced that he would be retiring from his weekly show on April 30, 2010.  ====''Moyers & Company''==== In August 2011 Moyers announced a new hour-long weekly interview show, ''[[Moyers & Company '', which premiered in January 2012. In that same month, Moyers also launched [http://www.billmoyers.com/ BillMoyers.com]. Later reduced to a half hour, ''Moyers & Company'' was produced by Public Affairs Television and distributed by [[American Public Television . The show has been heralded as a renewed fulfillment of public media's stated mission to air news and views unrepresented or underrepresented in commercial media.  The program concluded on January 2, 2015.  ==== Awards ==== In 1995, Bill Moyers was inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame . The same year, he also won the [[Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism . When he became a recipient of the 2006 Lifetime [[Emmy Award . ""Bill Moyers has devoted his lifetime to the exploration of the major issues and ideas of our time and our country, giving television viewers an informed perspective on political and societal concerns,"" according to the official announcement, which also noted that, ""The scope of and quality of his broadcasts have been honored time and again. It is fitting that the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences  honor him with our highest honor—the Lifetime Achievement Award.""<ref name=""lifetimeemmy""></ref> He has received well over thirty Emmys and virtually every other major television journalism prize, including a gold baton from the [[DuPont-Columbia Award|Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award s, a lifetime [[Peabody Award , and a [[George Polk Awards|George Polk Career Award   his third George Polk Award  for contributions to journalistic integrity and investigative reporting. He is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters  and has been the recipient of numerous honorary degrees, including a doctorate from the [[American Film Institute .<ref name=""MBC"" />  ==Commentary==  ===Regarding the U.S. media===  ====On the media and class warfare==== In a 2003 interview with BuzzFlash.com,<ref name=""BuzzFlash""></ref> Moyers said, ""The corporate right and the political right declared class warfare on working people a quarter of a century ago and they've won."" He noted, ""The rich are getting richer, which arguably wouldn't matter if the rising tide lifted all boats."" Instead, however, ""[t]he inequality gap is the widest it's been since 1929; the middle class is besieged and the working poor are barely keeping their heads above water."" He added that as ""the corporate and governing elites are helping themselves to the spoils of victory,"" access to political power has become ""who gets what and who pays for it.""  Meanwhile, the public has failed to react because it is, in his words, ""distracted by the media circus and news has been neutered or politicized for partisan purposes."" In support of this, he referred to ""the paradox of Rush Limbaugh, ensconced in a Palm Beach mansion massaging the resentments across the country of white-knuckled wage earners, who are barely making ends meet in no small part because of the corporate and ideological forces for whom Rush has been a hero. ... As Eric Alterman reports in his recent book—a book that I'm proud to have helped make happen—part of the red-meat strategy is to attack mainstream media relentlessly, knowing that if the press is effectively intimidated, either by the accusation of liberal bias or by a reporter's own mistaken belief in the charge's validity, the institutions that conservatives revere—corporate America, the military, organized religion, and their own ideological bastions of influence—will be able to escape scrutiny and increase their influence over American public life with relatively no challenge.""<ref name=""BuzzFlash""/>  ====On media bias==== When he retired in December 2004, the AP News Service quoted Moyers as saying, ""I'm going out telling the story that I think is the biggest story of our time: how the right-wing media has become a partisan propaganda arm of the [[Republican National Committee . We have an ideological press that's interested in the election of [[Republican Party  United States |Republicans , and a mainstream press that's interested in the bottom line. Therefore, we don't have a vigilant, independent press whose interest is the American people.""<ref name=""retire""></ref>  ===On Karl Rove and U.S. politics=== ;""The Progressive Story of America"" speech On June 4, 2003, Moyers gave a speech at the ""Take Back America"" conference. In it, Moyers defined what he considered  [[Karl Rove 's influence on [[George W. Bush 's administration. Moyers asserted that, from his reading of Rove, the mid-to-late 19th century was to Rove a ""cherished period of American history."" He further stated, ""From his own public comments and my reading of the record, it is apparent that Karl Rove has modeled the Bush presidency on that of [[William McKinley  ... and modeled himself on [[Mark Hanna , the man who virtually manufactured McKinley"",<ref name=""harvard""></ref><ref name=""scoop""></ref> a man whose primary ""passion"" was attending to corporate and imperial power.  Furthermore, Moyers indicated that Hanna gathered support for McKinley's presidential campaign from ""the corporate interests of the day"" and was responsible for Ohio and Washington coming under the rule of ""bankers, railroads and public utility corporations."" He submitted that political opponents of this transfer of power were ""smeared as disturbers of the peace, socialists, anarchists, or worse.""<ref name=""harvard""/><ref name=""scoop""/>  Moyers also referred to what historian Clinton Rossiter called the period of ""the great train robbery of American intellectual history,"" when ""conservatives—or better, pro-corporate apologists"" began using terms such as ''progress'', ''opportunity'', and ''individualism'' to make ""...the plunder of America sound like divine right."" He added that [[Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution was also used by conservative politicians, judges, and publicists to justify the idea of a ""natural order of things"" as well as ""the notion that progress resulted from the elimination of the weak and the 'survival of the fittest.'""<ref name=""harvard""/><ref name=""scoop""/>  He concludes, ""This 'degenerate and unlovely age', as one historian calls it, exists in the mind of Karl Rove, the reputed brain of George W. Bush, as the seminal age of inspiration for the politics and governance of America today.""<ref name=""harvard""/><ref name=""scoop""/>  ==Presidential draft initiative== On July 24, 2006, liberal political commentator [[Molly Ivins  published an article entitled ''Run Bill Moyers for President, Seriously'' on the progressive website [[Truthdig .<ref name=""ivinstruthdig""></ref> Then in October 2006 [[Ralph Nader  wrote an article supporting a Moyers candidacy.<ref name=""nadercommondreams""></ref> There was no effect from the op-eds, and Moyers did not run.  ==Allegations of bias== [[George W. Bush administration|Bush-appointee  [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting  chairman [[Kenneth Tomlinson  was a regular critic of Moyers; in 2003, he wrote to [[Pat Mitchell , the president of PBS, that ''[[NOW with Bill Moyers '' ""does not contain anything approaching the balance the law requires for public broadcasting.""<ref name=""lehrer05""></ref> In 2005, Tomlinson commissioned a study of the show, without informing or getting authorization from the CPB board. Tomlinson said that the study supported what he characterized as ""the image of the left-wing bias of NOW"".<ref name=""cpbbode""></ref> [[George Neumayr , the executive editor of ''[[The American Spectator '', a conservative magazine, told the ''[[NewsHour with Jim Lehrer '' that ""PBS looks like a liberal monopoly to me, and Bill Moyers is Exhibit A of that very strident, left-wing bias... [Moyers] uses his show as a platform from which to attack conservatives and Republicans.""<ref name=""lehrer05""/>  Moyers, who left the show in 2004 before returning in 2007, replied by saying that his journalism showed ""the actual experience of regular people is the missing link in a nation wired for everything but the truth."" Moyers characterized Tomlinson as ""an ally of Karl Rove and the right-wing monopoly's point man to keep tabs on public broadcasting."" Tomlinson, he said, ""found kindred spirits at the right-wing editorial board of ''[[The Wall Street Journal '' where the '[[animal spirits  Keynes |animal spirits  of business' are routinely celebrated.""<ref name=""cpbbode"" /> Moyers also responded to these accusations in a speech given to [[The National Conference for Media Reform , saying that he had repeatedly invited Tomlinson to debate him on the subject but had repeatedly been ignored.<ref name=""speechtoncmr""></ref> He spoke about this again a few months later in a speech called ""Democracy, Secrecy and Ideology"" on the 20th anniversary of the [[National Security Archive .<ref name=""speechnsa""></ref>  ==Organizations== Moyers is a former director of the [[Council on Foreign Relations   1967&ndash;1974 , and a member of the [[Bilderberg Group <ref name=""Former steering Committee Members - Bilderberg Group""></ref> and since 1990 has been president of the [[Schumann Center for Media and Democracy .  ==Personal life== [[File:Bill Moyers 2018  DIG14317-054 .jpg|thumb|Moyers at the [[LBJ Presidential Library  in 2018  Moyers married Judith Suzanne Davidson  a producer  on December 18, 1954.

362,Y,fastcompany.com,"   | issn           = 1085-9241    '''''Fast Company''''' is a monthly American business magazine published in print and online that focuses on technology, business, and design. It publishes eight print issues per year.  ==History== ''Fast Company'' was launched in November 1995 by [[Alan Webber  and [[Bill Taylor  businessman |Bill Taylor , two former ''[[Harvard Business Review '' editors, and publisher [[Mortimer Zuckerman .  The publication's early competitors included ''[[Red Herring  magazine |Red Herring '', ''[[Business 2.0 '' and ''[[The Industry Standard ''.  In 1997, ''Fast Company'' created an online social network, the ""Company of Friends"" which spawned a number of groups that began meeting in person. At one point the Company of Friends had over 40,000 members in 120 cities, although by 2003 that number had declined to 8,000.<ref name=slow-lane></ref>  In 2000, Zuckerman sold ''Fast Company'' to [[Gruner + Jahr , majority owned by media giant [[Bertelsmann , for $550 million. Just as the sale was completed, the collapse of the [[dot-com bubble  burst, leading to significant losses and a decline in circulation. Webber and Taylor left the magazine two years later in 2002, and John A. Byrne, previously a senior writer and former management editor with [[BusinessWeek , was brought in as the new editor. Under Byrne, the magazine won its first [[Gerald Loeb Award , the most prestigious honor in business journalism. But the magazine could not reverse its financial decline in the wake of the dot-com bust. Although the magazine was not specifically about Internet commerce, advertising pages continued to drop until they were one-third the 2000 numbers.<ref name=slow-lane/>  In 2005, Gruner + Jahr put the magazine, as well as ''[[Inc. magazine '', up for sale. Through a contact, Byrne contacted entrepreneur [[Joe Mansueto  and helped guide him through the sale. A bidding war ultimately ensued, pitting [[The Economist  against Mansueto's company Mansueto Ventures. Mansueto, the only bidder who promised to keep Fast Company alive, ultimately won the contest, buying both magazine titles for $35 million.   Under former editor-in-chief [[Robert Safian , ''Fast Company'' was named by the [[American Society of Magazine Editors  as the [[National Magazine Awards|magazine of the year  in 2014.  Stephanie Mehta was named editor-in-chief in February 2018, having previously worked at ''[[Vanity Fair  magazine |Vanity Fair '', ''[[Bloomberg_L.P.|Bloomberg '', ''[[Fortune  magazine |Fortune '', and ''[[The Wall Street Journal ''. ''Fast Company'' is owned by [[Mansueto Ventures  and is headquartered in New York, New York.  ==Website== Launched in 1995, FastCompany.com covers leadership and innovation in business, environmental and social issues, entertainment and marketing, and, through its Co.Design site, the intersection of business and design, from architecture to electronics, consumer products to fashion. ''Fast Company'' also previously operated sites called Co.Labs, Co.Exist, and Co.Create. Co.Exist and Co.Create were rebranded as Ideas and Entertainment sections in 2017. Co.Labs was shut down in early 2015.  == Current activity == ===Franchises=== ''Fast Company'' currently operates a number of franchises such as ""Most Innovative Companies"", ""World Changing Ideas"", ""Innovation By Design"", and ""Most Creative People"". For their Most Innovative Companies feature, ''Fast Company'' assesses thousands of businesses to create a list of 50 companies it considers the most innovative. The Most Creative People in Business is a list of 100 people from different industries.  ===Events=== The Fast Company Innovation Festival is an event hosted in [[New York City  each year since 2015.

The most recent owner was the [[Baltimore Sun  Media Group, which purchased the paper in 2014 from [[Times-Shamrock Communications , which had owned the newspaper since 1987. It was distributed on Wednesdays in distinctive yellow boxes found throughout the Baltimore area.   The paper folded in 2017, due to the collapse of advertising revenue income to print media.<ref name=""SullivanTheAtlantic""></ref>  ==History== Russ Smith and Alan Hirsch started the Baltimore City Paper in May 1977 while students at Johns Hopkins University.  It was originally named the ''City Squeeze'' and Smith and Hirsch published it using the offices of the Johns Hopkins student newspaper.  In 1978, they took the paper out of the University and started publishing it as the ''Baltimore City Paper''.   Smith said that he viewed the paper as an alternatively weekly similar to the ''Chicago Reader'' and the ''Boston Real Paper''.  The paper has been free, except for a time between 1979–81, where they charged .25 per issue.  Charging a fee turned out to be mistake, as most of the paper's income came through advertising revenue and the fee led to a precipitous drop in circulation, and consequently advertising revenues.  It is best known for providing information on [[nightclub|club s, [[concert s, [[theater , and [[restaurant s, but each issue also has one major article on a subject not usually being carried by the [[Mass media|mainstream media . In each issue there are also several political and advice columns and  numerous [[cartoon s including the weekly comic ''DIRTFARM'' by [[Ben Claassen III .  In 2017, the paper ceased publication. The ''[[Baltimore Beat '' started after.  ==Notable stories== The ''City Paper'' has broken several important stories in the Baltimore area, including a [[plagiarism  [[scandal  involving longtime ''[[Baltimore Sun '' columnist [[Michael Olesker .  The ''City Paper'' presents the Best of Baltimore awards every year, in which various local businesses, attractions, and aspects of Baltimore, Maryland are highlighted.  In the summer of 2013, Times-Shamrock Communications announced its intention to sell off all of its alternative newspapers outside Pennsylvania, including the ''City Paper''. In February 2014, the [[Baltimore Sun  Media Group announced it had reached an agreement to purchase the ''Baltimore City Paper'', with the sale to close in March 2014.  ==Notable writers== * [[J. D.

The site features a participatory political encyclopedia  ""DKosopedia"" , glossaries, and other content. It is sometimes considered an example of ""[[netroots "" activism.  It was founded in 2002 by [[Markos Moulitsas  and takes the name ''Kos'' from the last syllable of his first name, his nickname whilst in the military.  == Organization overview ==  === Funding and personnel === In 2007, its parent company, Kos Media, LLC, began a fellowship program to help fund a new generation of progressive activists. Approximately a dozen contributing editors provide content for the site, with three or four new editors being chosen from the Daily Kos community every year.  It is financially sustained by advertising, through Google [[AdSense  and Blogads. The advertisements focus mainly on activist causes, media, and political candidates. The site also offers an ad-free subscription to members.  === Viewership and reception === As of September 2014, Daily Kos has had an average weekday traffic of hundreds of thousands.  In 2008, ''[[Time  magazine |Time '' magazine readers named Daily Kos the second best blog. But in 2009, ''Time'' listed Daily Kos in its ""Most Overrated Blogs"" section due to the loss of its mission, fighting the ""oppressive and war-crazed"" Republican administration, during Democrat [[Barack Obama 's presidency. The website ran on the Scoop [[content management system  until 2011 when it moved to its own custom content management system referred to as ""DK 4.0"". In 2016 and 2017 the Trump presidency brought out huge support for the blog, with over half a million in direct donations being received from their email campaigns.  == Content == Moulitsas and a small group of select contributors post directly to the front page; other users can post ""diaries"", the titles of which appear on the front page in reverse chronological order, with special attention and longer display time for those diaries highly recommended by other users. The other major source of content is the comments posted in response to front page entries and diaries. Comments for popular or controversial diaries or front-page articles can run into the thousands.  Front page entries and diaries often take the form of news stories from an outside source interspersed with commentary from the author of the diary or post. Sometimes these stories contain a request for action from other members of the community, such as to get involved with a particular campaign, give money to a candidate or contact an elected official about an issue. Some front page entries are called ""open threads"", which encourage people to post comments on any issue. An example of these open threads are the ""live threads"" of commentary on important events happening in real time, such as debates or elections.  Administrators may delete diaries, though this is done very rarely. ""Trusted users"" have the ability to recommend or hide responses posted by ordinary members whose comments they deem solely disruptive. Less than 0.01% of comments are hidden.  Daily Kos had previously partnered with [[Research 2000  to produce [[nonpartisan  polling for presidential, congressional and gubernatorial races across the country. In June 2010, Daily Kos terminated their relationship, after finding that their data showed statistical anomalies consistent with deliberate falsification and announced its intention to sue the polling firm.  On November 30, 2010, an agreement to settle began, as lawyers for the Plaintiff filed a status report indicating that both parties were in ""agreement as to the contours of a proper settlement but are still in the process of determining whether the execution of the proposed terms is feasible."" In May 2011, [[Huffington Post|''The Huffington Post''  reported that the lawsuit had been settled, with Research 2000 pollster Del Ali making payments to Daily Kos.  == Guest bloggers ==  Beginning in 2003, as his blog expanded to a community, Kos appointed four or five ""guest bloggers""  also called ""front page diarists,"" ""contributing editors,"" ""front-pagers,"" or simply ""FPers""  who were selected from the community and tasked with regular contributions on the front page  without needing to have their articles recommended or promoted .  * '''2003''': [[Billmon ; Steve Soto; [[Steve Gilliard ; RonK, Seattle * '''2004''': Meteor Blades; DHinMI; Melanie; Trapper John; theoria; DemFromCT * '''2005''': DavidNYC; kid oakland; Hunter; Armando; a gilas girl; Plutonium Page * '''2006''': georgia10; SusanG; mcjoan; DarkSyde; Superribbie  announced as a front-pager, but backed out the next day, citing time constraints  * '''2007''': BarbinMD; Kagro X; Devilstower; MissLaura * '''2008''': brownsox; Scout Finch; smintheus; Jed L. * '''2009''': Steve Singiser * '''2011''': Scott Wooledge, Mark Fiore, Denise Oliver-Velez * '''2012''': Shanikka, Mother Mags, John Perr * '''2013''': V.L.

Newkirk II  Additionally, whilst on the [[promotional tour  for ''[[Crashing the Gate '', Kos turned over much of the day-to-day management to the 2006 guest bloggers. Emeritus guest bloggers have frequently retained some privileges depending on circumstances, but are not expected to post as often.  A front-page diarist known as ""Armando""  Armando Lloréns-Sar  took a prominent role during Moulitsas' book hiatus in 2005 and was well known for his foreign policy and legal analysis. He also had his own political blogging website, called ""Swords Crossed"" that encouraged dialog between liberals and conservatives, and was a guest [[Pundit  politics |political commentator  in a wide variety of media outlets, including ''[[The Majority Report '' and ''[[Talking Points Memo '' Cafe. After his identity and details of his legal career were made widely known, he announced his departure from Daily Kos in June 2006, citing loss of anonymity. For two months, Armando would resurface periodically, his comments in this time were accompanied by a signature line stating that he would be returning to blogging in December 2006. Armando did indeed return, albeit under a user ID, ""Big Tent Democrat,"" in September 2006. Armando ""Big Tent Democrat"" then left the Daily Kos site again in March 2007, citing ""differences with the Management.""  Another contributor, who posts pseudonymously as ""DarkSyde"", writes on the front page of Daily Kos and a blog called Unscrewing the Inscrutable. He is best known as a science writer with specific attention paid to biology, astronomy, and political issues such as [[creationism  or climate change. In particular, DarkSyde's [[Hurricane Katrina  diaries were widely read during the storm and in the immediate aftermath. They are included in a collection of science articles in the e-book ''Kosmos: You Are Here'', co-written with science fiction novelist Mark Sumner and illustrated by paleowildlife artist Carl Buell. All the contributors to ''Kosmos'' donated the proceeds to fund the [[YearlyKos  convention.  ""Bill in Portland Maine""  Bill Harnsberger  is a [[wikt:front page|front page  regular, best known for his recurring '''Cheers & Jeers''' [[feature story|feature , in which he bestows plaudits and brickbats on various newsmakers. Cheers & Jeers, which first appeared on Daily Kos in 2003, has evolved into a mini-community within the larger Daily Kos community, in which members post announcements about weddings, engagements, births, deaths, pet news, and other personal items, as well as sharing their own particular plaudits and brickbats. He lives with his partner Michael  known as ""Common Sense Mainer"" , a cat named Vegas, and his beloved [[Labrador Retriever|chocolate lab , Molly. In the fall of 2007, Harnsberger lost his job, and the Daily Kos community collected $50,000 in pledges to allow him to continue to write Cheers & Jeers in a full-time paid position.  On June 2, 2007, [[Steve Gilliard , one of the blog's original contributors, died at the age of 42. <!-- Many articles including the above article by Daily Kos's Meteor Blades' listed Gilly's age at death as 41. This is due to a Primary Source error; The News Blog itself posted Steve's age as 41 initially on June 2, 2007. It corrected the date two days later upon receiving an update from the Gilliard family. Please do not change Steve's age of death back. The NY Times Obit and the Gilliard page are correct. Thanks. -->  In December 2015, Faith Gardner, the Social Media Director, started a rotating Featured Writer program, to promote articles by top diarists responsible for the most-trafficked stories on social media. The initial four were SemDem, Dartagnan, xxdr zombiexx, and Pakalolo.  == YearlyKos convention ==  In June 2006, members of Daily Kos organized the first ever Daily Kos political blogger convention, called YearlyKos, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas , [[Nevada . The event was attended by approximately 1000<ref name=""PNO""></ref> bloggers, and featured appearances by prominent Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader [[Harry Reid , [[California  Senator [[Barbara Boxer , General [[Wesley Clark , Governors [[Mark Warner , [[Bill Richardson , [[Tom Vilsack  and [[Democratic National Committee|DNC  Chair [[Howard Dean . The event was widely covered in the traditional media, including ''Capitol Hill Blue'',<ref name=""CHB""></ref> ''The Boston Globe''<ref name=""BG""></ref> and MSNBC.<ref name=""MSNBC""></ref> [[C-SPAN  also carried portions of the convention.<ref name=""C-SPAN""></ref>  The event was generally<ref name=""YKos"">[http://www.dailykos.com/tag/yearlyKos%202006 Yearly Kos Tag], Listing of Diaries on Daily Kos. Retrieved on 2006-07-19.</ref> considered a success. YearlyKos 2007 took place in [[Chicago  in August 2007, at which time it was announced that future conventions would be known as [[Netroots Nation . In 2008, the conference was held in Austin, Texas, with a surprise visit from [[Al Gore . The 2009 conference was held in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  from August 13 to 16. The 2017 conference was the first time the convention was held in the [[Deep South , in [[Atlanta, Georgia . Conferences are always held in venues that support a union.  ==Political activity== Daily Kos endorsed Democratic candidate [[Hillary Clinton  in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

It is one of the French-speaking province's last two English-language dailies; the other is the ''[[Sherbrooke Record '', which serves the anglophone community in the Eastern Townships southeast of Montreal.  Founded in 1778 by [[Fleury Mesplet , ''The Gazette'' is Quebec's oldest daily newspaper and Canada's oldest daily newspaper still in publication.<ref name=""about""></ref> The oldest newspaper overall is the English-language ''[[Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph '', which was established in 1764 and is published weekly.  ==History== [[File:Gazette Montreal.png|thumb|left|upright|Offices of ''The Gazette'' in the [[Dominion Square Building  on [[Saint Catherine Street  in [[Montreal    [[Fleury Mesplet  founded a French-language weekly newspaper called ''La Gazette du commerce et littéraire, pour la ville et district de Montréal'' on June 3, 1778.<ref name=biographi></ref> It was the first entirely French-language newspaper in Canada.<ref name=biographi /> The paper did not accept advertising aside for the various books Mesplet also published. The articles were meant to promote discussion, and focused on [[literature  and [[philosophy , as well as various anecdotal articles, [[poetry|poems  and letters.<ref name=biographi /> [[Benjamin Franklin  encouraged Mesplet to found the newspaper to persuade Canadians to join the [[American Revolution ;<ref name=""dougherty20170128""></ref> Mesplet, an immigrant from France, had previously lived in [[Philadelphia , and supported the Americans when they occupied Montreal during the war. The newspaper was shut down in 1779 when Mesplet and the editor, [[Valentin Jautard  were arrested for [[sedition  and imprisoned for three years.  Mesplet began a second weekly, ''The Montreal Gazette / La Gazette de Montréal'', on August 25, 1785, which had a dual French-English bilingual format similar to that used by the ''[[Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph|Quebec Gazette ''.<ref name=biographi /> Its offices were located in the house of Joseph Lemoyne de Longueuil on rue de la Capitale.<ref name=Vieux></ref>  French columns were in the left-hand column and English columns in the right-hand column. The columns were originally written in French and translated to English by Valentin Jautard, who served as editor until his death in 1787.<ref name=biographi /> The columns were mostly on education, religion and literature, and after 1788 on politics.<ref name=biographi /> Foreign and local news made up the rest of the paper. The paper took a [[Voltaire|Voltairian  and [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical  stance, wanted Quebec to have its own [[legislative assembly , and sought to import the principles of the [[French revolution  to Quebec.<ref name=biographi />  The newspaper also introduced advertising and announcements, taking up half of four pages. It is the direct ancestor of the current newspaper. The newspaper did well, and Mesplet's operation moved to [[Notre-Dame Street  in 1787. Mesplet continued to operate the newspaper until his death in 1794.<ref name=biographi />  Following Mesplet's death, his widow published the newspaper for several issues, but the paper ceased publication soon after. Two rivals, Louis Roy and Edward Edwards fought over the right to publish the newspaper over the course of two years.<ref name=Vieux /> Edwards eventually won the printing press and newspaper, and continued operations until his assets were seized in 1808.<ref name=Vieux /> The newspaper was then the property of James Brown for fourteen years. In 1822, it was sold to businessman Thomas Andrew Turner who converted into an English-only paper in 1822.<ref name=about /><ref name=Vieux /> Under Turner, ''The Gazette'' identified with the interests of anglophone business leaders in their fight with the [[Patriote movement .<ref name=Vieux />  On April 25, 1849, ''The Gazette'' published a special edition in which its editor-in-chief, [[James Moir Ferres , called the ""[[Anglo-Saxon "" residents to arms after Royal Assent of a compensation law for Lower Canada.<ref name=""wikisource""></ref> This was among the main events leading to the [[Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal|burning of the Parliament Buildings . Ferres was subsequently arrested.  In 1968, ''The Gazette'' was acquired by the [[Southam Inc.|Southam  newspaper chain, which owned major dailies across Canada.<ref name=""about""/>  For many years, ''The Gazette'' was caught in a three-way fight for the English newspaper audience in Montreal with the tabloid ''[[Montreal Herald '' and the broadsheet ''[[Montreal Star ''.<ref name=TCE></ref>  ''The Gazette'' was second in circulation to the ''Montreal Star'', which sold more newspapers in the city and had a significant national reputation in the first half of the 20th century. The ''Montreal Herald'' closed in 1957, after publishing for 146 years.  The ''Montreal Star'', part of the FP Publications chain  which owned the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press '' and, at the time, ''[[The Globe and Mail '' , endured a long strike and ceased publication in 1979, less than a year after the strike was settled. [[File:Gazette reader.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A statue in [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount  of man reading ''The Gazette''  In 1988, a competing English-language daily, the ''[[Montreal Daily News '', was launched. The ''Montreal Daily News'' adopted a tabloid format and introduced a Sunday edition, forcing ''The Gazette'' to respond. After the ''Montreal Daily News'' closed in 1989, after less than two years in operation, ''The Gazette'' kept its Sunday edition going until August 2010.  In 1996, the Southam papers were bought by [[Conrad Black 's [[Hollinger Inc.  Then in August 2000, Hollinger sold the Southam newspapers, including ''The Gazette'', to [[Canwest|Canwest Global Communications Corp. , controlled by the Winnipeg-based Asper family. In 2010, a new media group, [[Postmedia , bought the Gazette and other papers from the financially troubled Canwest.<ref name=TCE />  To celebrate its 150th anniversary, ''The Gazette'' published a [[facsimile  of one of its earliest issues. Much effort was made to use a type of paper that imitated 18th century paper, with fake chainlines and laidlines to make the paper look old.  ==Today== Today, ''The Gazette''s audience is primarily Quebec's English-speaking community. ''The Gazette'' is one of the four dailies published in Montreal, the other three being French-language newspapers  ''[[La Presse  Canada |La Presse '', ''[[Le Journal de Montréal '', and ''[[Le Devoir '' .  In recent years, ''The Gazette'' has stepped up efforts to reach bilingual francophone professionals and adjusted its coverage accordingly. The current editor-in-chief is Lucinda Chodan and the associate managing editors are James Bassil and Jeff Blond.<ref name=Contact />  [[File:Montreal gazette logo.svg|250px|thumb|Final version of the paper's logotype under the title ''The Gazette''   On April 30, 2013, [[Postmedia Network  announced that it would be eliminating the role of publisher at each of its newspapers, including ''The Gazette''. Instead, the company's 10 newspapers will be overseen by regional publishers--one each for the Pacific, the Prairies and eastern Canada.  Alan Allnutt, who was the publisher of ''The Gazette'' at the time, became the regional publisher of Postmedia's [[Alberta  and [[Saskatchewan  papers. Gerry Nott, publisher of the ''[[Ottawa Citizen '', now also oversees ''The Gazette'', the ''[[Windsor Star '' and Postmedia's flagship title, the ''[[National Post ''.<ref name=FinancialPost></ref> On May 5, 2014, it was announced that printing of ''The Gazette'' would be contracted out to [[Transcontinental Media  in August 2014 and that the existing Notre-Dame-de-Grâce facility would be closed, resulting in a loss of 54 full-time and 61 part-time positions at the paper. The August 16, 2014 issue was the final issue printed by the Postmedia-owned facility.<ref name=global-tcprinting></ref><ref name=ctv-closed></ref>  On October 21, 2014, ''The Gazette'' was relaunched as part of the Postmedia Reimagined project, adopting a similar look, and similar suite of digital platforms, to its sister paper, the ''Ottawa Citizen'', which had relaunched earlier in the year. As part of the relaunch, the paper was officially renamed the ''Montreal Gazette'', reflecting its longstanding common name outside its city of publication  as well as its Web domain, ''montrealgazette.com'' .  The paper had not included Montreal in its masthead in several years. The new typeface and style introduced with the rename has been criticized as being ""sub-par"".  ===Sections=== ;Weekdays *Section A&nbsp;— Local, national and international news, opinion columns, editorials, editorial cartoon, letters to the editor, business news, sports news, arts and entertainment news *Section B&nbsp;— Sports  Mondays and Thursdays , Business  Tuesdays , Food  Wednesdays , Movies  Fridays  *Section C&nbsp;— Driving and classifieds  Mondays   ;Saturday *Section A&nbsp;— Local, national and international news *Section B&nbsp;— Saturday Extra: Feature stories and opinion columns, editorials, editorial cartoon, letters to the editor *Section C&nbsp;— Business news and weather *Section D&nbsp;— Sports *Section E&nbsp;— Culture *Section F&nbsp;— Homefront, classified, working *Section G&nbsp;— Travel *Section H&nbsp;— Weekend Life *Section W&nbsp;— Diversions  ==[[Editor-in-chief|Editors-in-chief == * [[Mark Harrison  journalist |Mark Harrison   1977–1989 <ref name=MarkHarrison></ref> * [[Norman Webster   1989–1993 <ref name=""Webster-Maclean's""></ref> * [[Joan Fraser   1993–1996 <ref name=Senate></ref> * [[Alan Allnutt   1996–2000  * [[Peter Stockland   2000–2004  * [[Andrew Phillips  editor |Andrew Phillips   2004–2009 <ref name=Phillips></ref> * [[Raymond Brassard   2010–2013 <ref name=BrassardChodan></ref> * [[Lucinda Chodan   2013–present <ref name=BrassardChodan />  ==Present personalities==   *[[Mark Abley  *[[Henry Aubin  *[[Janet Bagnall  *[[Mike Boone  *[[Bill Brownstein  *[[Jay Bryan   *[[Josh Freed  *[[Pat Hickey  journalist |Pat Hickey  *[[Josée Legault  *[[L.

''ThinkProgress'' describes itself as ""editorially independent"" of the [[Center for American Progress  and CAP Action.<ref name=Beaujon/> In its early years, ''ThinkProgress'' included a daily newsletter that contained a recap and analysis of major political news and the blog ''Wonk Room'', which was published until 2011. In that year, the site was redesigned to offer sections organized by subject matter, and other [[Center for American Progress#Center for American Progress Action Fund|CAP Action  blogs were consolidated into the site. The site was then divided into sections covering climate, economy, health, justice, [[LGBT , world, culture, sports, politics and features. In 2017, the site's organization returned to a less segmented presentation.<ref name=masthead2017></ref>  ''ThinkProgress'' had a staff of five in 2006<ref name=guardian20060915/> and 42 in 2017.<ref name=masthead2017/> In 2015, the staff of ''ThinkProgress'' unionized with the [[Writers Guild of America, East .

For example, ''Times'' reporter [[Ian Urbina , in his coverage of hostility in the health care reform debate, cited a 2009 ''ThinkProgress'' report by [[Lee Fang  on a [[Tea Party Patriots  strategy memo advocating disrupting town hall meetings of Democratic members of Congress. After the [[Upper Big Branch Mine disaster  in 2010, ''ThinkProgress'' reported on the safety record of mine owner [[Massey Energy , finding over $2.2 million in fines levied by the [[Mine Safety and Health Administration  against Massey for more than 3,000 safety violations; ''Times'' reporter [[Tom Zeller Jr.  cited the figures in the ''Times'''s coverage of Massey's safety record. In 2013, ''ThinkProgress'' posted a video of Pam Simon, a staffer for Representative [[Gabrielle Giffords , who was shot alongside Giffords in 2011, confronting Senator [[Kelly Ayotte  regarding Ayotte's opposition to closing the [[gun show loophole ; the ''Times'' cited the video in a report on [[gun control  activism among gun violence victims. In a 2015 op-ed in the ''Times'', [[Charles M. Blow  excerpted ''ThinkProgress'' research on gender in [[chief executive officer  hiring. The same year, Blow excerpted ''ThinkProgress'' research on the effectiveness of drug screening of [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  recipients in an analysis of the political rhetoric of poverty.  In 2006, ''The Guardian'' highlighted a series of reports in ''ThinkProgress'' that exposed inaccuracies in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC  television mini-series ''[[The Path to 9/11 ''. The network re-edited several disputed scenes.<ref name=guardian20060915></ref> In 2011 a report in ''The Guardian'' by [[Ewen MacAskill , [[Julian Borger , Jon Boone and [[Nicholas Watt  on U. S. policy toward Afghanistan excerpted a ''ThinkProgress'' interview with Senator [[Barney Frank . In 2016 a ''Guardian'' investigation by [[Jonathan Freedland  of the basis of [[Donald Trump 's claims of [[Electoral fraud|voter fraud  in the [[Iowa Caucuses  excerpted a ''ThinkProgress'' report that a two-year investigation by the Iowa Secretary of State found no [[Voter impersonation  United States |voter impersonation . Similarly, a 2012 ''Washington Post'' article cited ''ThinkProgress'' research showing that [[Crossroads GPS  failed to register as a nonprofit organization in [[Virginia . ''ThinkProgress'' reported an average of one [[school shooting  every other day in the first days of 2014; ''Post'' columnist [[Dana Milbank  cited the research in a 2014 column on the lack of progress on gun control. In 2017 [[Fareed Zakaria , in a ''Post'' opinion piece, cited a ''ThinkProgress'' compilation of policies that candidate Trump pledged to implement on his first day as President. In 2017 ''Wall Street Journal'' columnist [[William Galston  cited a ''ThinkProgress'' report of 52% unemployment among 16- to 64-year-olds in the [[Sandtown-Winchester  neighborhood of [[Baltimore , twice the unemployment rate of the city as a whole. In 2014, ''Time'' magazine, CNN and [[NPR  picked up ''ThinkProgress'' reports on [[Chipotle Mexican Grill 's including in their annual report a warning to investors regarding the risk of [[climate change  on operations.<ref name=Beaujon/>  ''ThinkProgress'' reports have also been cited by academic researchers in peer-reviewed journals such as ''[[Climatic Change  journal |Climatic Change '' and ''[[The American Economic Review ''. In 2017 ''ThinkProgress'' published the disciplinary records of the New York City police officer who put [[Eric Garner  in a [[Death of Eric Garner|fatal choke hold . ''ThinkProgress'' also tracks [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim  and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic  incidents.  === ''Climate Progress'' === After his 2011 ''Climate Progress'' report identifying [[food security|food insecurity  as ""the biggest impact that climate change is likely to have on most people for most of this century"", the journal ''[[Nature  journal |Nature '' invited Romm to write a commentary on [[desertification .<ref name=nature20111027></ref> In a 2016 article in ''The New York Times'', [[Andrew Revkin  recommended Romm's assessment in ''Climate Progress'' of the prospects for the climate and the environment under newly elected President Trump. [[Andrew Leonard  in ''[[Salon  website |Salon '', [[John Rennie  editor |John Rennie  of the [[PLOS|Public Library of Science  and [[Jim Naureckas  of [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting  cited a 2010 ''Climate Progress'' report in their critiques of an online poll regarding attitudes toward climate change conducted by ''[[Scientific American '' magazine.  ==Reception== ''ThinkProgress'' had about 100,000 visitors per day in 2006,<ref name=guardian20060915/> 6 million [[Unique user#Unique visitor|unique visitors  and 14 million [[page view s in March 2014,<ref name=Beaujon/> and 8 to 10 million unique page views per month in 2017.<ref name=poynter20170630></ref> In 2017 [[Lifewire  ranked ''ThinkProgress'' among the ten most popular news blogs on the Internet.  In 2008, ''[[Time  magazine |Time '' magazine named ''Climate Progress'' one of the ""Top 15 Green Websites,"" saying that ''Climate Progress'' ""counters bad science and inane rhetoric with original analysis.""<ref name=time20080417/> In 2009, [[Thomas Friedman , in his column in ''The New York Times'', called ''Climate Progress'' ""indispensable."" In 2010 ''Time'' included ''Climate Progress'' in a list of the 25 ""Best Blogs of 2010"", saying ''Climate Progress'' was one of ""the blogs we can't live without."" In 2010, UK's ''[[The Guardian '' included ''Climate Progress'' on its list of ""Top 50 Twitter climate accounts to follow"", saying ''Climate Progress'' was one of ""the key people and organisations you should be following on Twitter if you're interested in climate change."" In 2015 Tim Ward wrote in ''[[HuffPost '' that ''Climate Progress'' ""has been the best available source of climate-change news for several years.""<ref name=huffpo20151217/>  ''ThinkProgress'' reports have sometimes been criticized. For example, in 2010, Lee Fang wrote in ''ThinkProgress'' that the [[United States Chamber of Commerce  funded political advertising campaigns from its general fund, which solicits funds from foreign sources. [[FactCheck.org  said that the claim that ""foreign corporations are 'stealing our democracy' with secret, illegal contributions funneled through the U.S. Chamber of Commerce"" had ""little basis in fact. ... At least 84 foreign companies pay at least $885,000 in dues to the [Chamber of Commerce], according to ThinkProgress. Still lacking, though, is any proof that the money is being used in the chamber’s ad campaign.""<ref name=factcheck></ref> [[Eric Lichtblau  of ''The New York Times'' said that the article ""provided no evidence that the money generated overseas had been used in United States campaigns.""  In 2015 [[Glenn Greenwald  wrote in ''[[The Intercept '' that CAP officials pressured ''ThinkProgress'' staff into placating the Israeli government and the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee  in their Mideast reporting. As he noted, however, CAP had stated: ""The clear and overwhelming record of the literally hundreds of articles and policy papers from the Center for American Progress and ''ThinkProgress'' demonstrates our longstanding support both for Israel and the two-state solution to the Middle East peace process as being in the moral and national security interests of the United States.""  ==References==   ==External links== * *[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9o--yCqmU 10 Years of ''ThinkProgress'' and the Future of Digital Media]  2015 panel discussion   [[Category:American political websites  [[Category:American political blogs  [[Category:Internet properties established in 2005  [[Category:Media analysis organizations and websites  [[Category:Progressivism in the United States ","ThinkProgress is an American news website.

It is owned by [[The McClatchy Company .  ==History== In May 1905, [[Amon G. Carter  accepted a job as an advertising space salesman in Fort Worth. A few months later, he agreed to help finance and run a new newspaper in town. The ''Fort Worth Star'' printed its first newspaper on February 1, 1906, with Carter as the advertising manager.  The ''Star'' lost money, and was in danger of going bankrupt when Carter had an audacious idea: raise additional money and purchase his newspaper's main competition, the ''Fort Worth Telegram''. In November 1908, the ''Star'' purchased the ''Telegram'' for [[USD|$ 100,000, and the two newspapers combined on January 1, 1909, into the ''Fort Worth Star-Telegram''.  From 1923 until after World War II, the ''Star-Telegram'' was distributed over one of the largest circulation areas of any newspaper in the [[Southern United States|South , serving not just Fort Worth but also [[West Texas , [[New Mexico  and western [[Oklahoma . The newspaper created [[WBAP  AM |WBAP  in 1922 and Texas' first television station, [[KXAS|WBAP-TV , in 1948.  ==Market== The ''Star-Telegram’s'' circulation area is the Fort Worth/Arlington metro area  four counties  and 14 surrounding counties.

405,Y,votevets.org,"  '''VoteVets.org''' is a [[political action committee   PAC  and [[501 c  4   nonprofit organization in the United States.<ref name=""TPM DC1""></ref><ref name=""news source name#""></ref><ref name=""National Review1""></ref><ref name=""Politico1""></ref><ref name=""MSNBC1""></ref> It was co-founded in 2006 by [[Jon Soltz  and Jeremy Broussard.  Initially composed of United States [[Iraq  and [[Afghanistan  war [[veterans , the organization views defense policy as an American priority. The stated goal of the PAC is to put in Congress Afghanistan or Iraq war veterans who are critical of the execution of the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq .  According to the VoteVets.org, the goal of the 501 c  4  is to educate the American public on the war and military issues, and hold politicians accountable. In February 2007, a VoteVets.org spokesman told ''[[The Washington Post '' that the group had 20,000 members, including 1,000 veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan'.<ref name=""Washington Post1"">  Accessed via [[Lexis Nexis .</ref>  According to the group's website, the group has over 500,000 supporters.  Although a [[nonpartisan  organization, it has been described as ""closely aligned with Congressional Democrats,"" and ""[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal "" in news stories.<ref name=WaPoPartisan></ref><ref name=NYT></ref><ref name=""WaPo""></ref> In a June 2011 press release, the organization specifically identified itself as the ""largest [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive  group of veterans in America.""  ==2006 elections== During the [[United States general elections, 2006|United States 2006 election cycle , VoteVets.org PAC spent between $1.2 and $2 million   sources differ  trying to influence the outcomes of various congressional races. <ref name=""New York Times1""></ref> <ref name=""New York Magazine1"">  Accessed via [[Lexis Nexis .</ref> Senators targeted by the VoteVets' campaign for their support of the [[Iraq War  include: Republicans [[Virginia United States Senate election, 2006|George Allen , [[Pennsylvania United States Senate election, 2006|Rick Santorum , [[Montana United States Senate election, 2006|Conrad Burns , and [[Missouri United States Senate election, 2006|Jim Talent .<ref name=""New York Magazine1"" />  For each congressional campaign, they released a television advertisement criticizing the  now former  senators for their vote against [[body armor  for US troops in 2003.<ref name=""youtube1"">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8zQA1gYwpk YouTube] Vote Vets PAC television advertisement against George Allen.</ref>  VoteVets claim was based, in part, on the [[Republican Party  United States |Republican  senators' vote against an amendment offered <ref name=""San Diego Tribune1"">  Accessed via [[Lexis Nexis .</ref> by Democratic Louisiana Senator [[Mary Landrieu , in 2003, to boost [[United States National Guard|National Guard  and Reserves equipment funding by $1 billion. <ref name=""Associated Press1"">  Accessed via [[Lexis Nexis .</ref>  The group [[FactCheck.org   a self-described non-partisan project of the [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg Center  at the [[University of Pennsylvania   stated that the ad was misleading because the 2003 Senate budget amendment  on which the criticism was based  made no specific reference to ""body armor"". <ref name=""Pittsburgh Post1"">  Accessed via [[Lexis Nexis .</ref>  However, the progressive [[Media Matters for America  repeatedly pointed out what it said were ""misleading"" statements about the ads by FactCheck.org.<ref name=""MediaMatters1""></ref><ref name=""MediaMatters2""></ref><ref name=""MediaMatters3""></ref><ref name=""MediaMatters4""></ref>  The group also ran ads targeting now-former Republican Representatives [[Melissa Hart  politician |Melissa Hart , Gil Gutknecht, [[John E. Sweeney|John Sweeney ,  John Doolittle, and Jon Porter. In that ad, an Iraq veteran, Tomas Young, who was paralyzed in Iraq, criticized the members of Congress for voting against increases in funding for veterans’ health care, while, in some cases, voting themselves a pay raise.  The group also made a number of contributions to candidates, but only to those candidates who served during the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan.  In 2006, out of all the Iraq or Afghanistan veterans running for Congress, VoteVets.org supported all but one of them  [[Van Taylor , Republican in Texas .  Those endorsed candidates were:  [[Patrick Murphy  Pennsylvania politician |Patrick Murphy   D-PA , [[Joe Sestak   D-PA , [[Tammy Duckworth   D-IL , Sam Schultz  R-IN , [[Andrew Duck   D-MD , and David Harris  D-TX .  The group also supported [[Tim Walz   D-MN , and [[Chris Carney   D-PA .  Murphy, Sestak, Walz, and Carney were all elected to Congress, and VoteVets.org’s site indicates they have been endorsed for their 2008 reelection.  ==2008 elections==  VoteVets.org Political Action Committee continued to endorse Iraq and Afghanistan veterans for Congress in the 2008 elections.  Those include [[Rick Noriega   D-TX  who ran for Senate in Texas against incumbent [[John Cornyn , and many who ran for the House, including John Boccieri  D-OH , [[Michael D. Lumpkin   D-CA , Ashwin Madia  D-MN , Jill Morgenthaler  D-IL , Steve Sarvi  D-MN , and Jonathan Powers  D-NY .  The group also has endorsed candidates who are not Iraq or Afghanistan combat veterans, including Eric Massa  D-NY , and Gary Peters  D-MI , who both served within the last decade.  The group also held an on-line runoff, in which members were able to vote for one older veteran to endorse.  That runoff was won by Charlie Brown  D-CA , who the group endorsed.  The group also endorsed the candidates who it endorsed in 2006 and reached Congress, Democratic Representatives [[Patrick Murphy  Pennsylvania politician |Patrick Murphy , [[Joe Sestak , [[Tim Walz , and [[Chris Carney . Overall, VoteVets PAC contributed nearly $500,000 to candidates and other PACs during the 2008 election cycle.  While VoteVets did not officially endorse a candidate for president in 2008, the group did publicly support [[Barack Obama|Barack Obama's  plan for Iraq and actively opposed [[John McCain|John McCain's  campaign for President, despite McCain being an honored war veteran.<ref name=""news source name#""/>  ==Action Fund== VoteVets.org Action Fund, the group's non-profit wing, has also been active in the paid airwaves. The first ad generated by the action fund was an ad critical of then-Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman, for ""failing to ask the tough questions"" on the war. The group ran a newspaper ad and radio ad, featuring Jeremy Broussard, in Connecticut. The Action Fund also commissioned a 2006 poll, conducted by pollster [[Celinda Lake , of troops who had returned from Iraq. That poll found many troops did not feel they were given what they needed to succeed in Iraq, and even more had faced medical, mental, and financial hardship when they returned home.  The action fund ran a television ad that gained national prominence titled, ""Because of Iraq."" That ad was notable because it included the image of another television ad, featuring [[Osama bin Laden , produced by the Republican National Committee, commonly referred to as the ""ticking time bomb"" ad. The ad from VoteVets begins with a series of veterans of the war explaining what they felt was a negative impact of the war in Iraq. For example, one veteran said, ""Because of Iraq, there are more terrorists in the world."" At the end of the VoteVets ad, General [[Wesley Clark  says, ""So if you see commercials telling you to be afraid of terrorism, remember: It's because of Iraq.""  In a series of ads that may have received the most attention for the group, VoteVets.org presented three generals, two of whom were commanders on the ground in Iraq, who became critical of President Bush's execution of the war. Those were Major General  ret.  [[John Batiste , Major General  ret.  Paul Eaton, and General [[Wesley Clark . Major General Batiste had commanded the First Infantry Division in Iraq, and Major General Eaton had been the first to be in command of rebuilding Iraqi Defense Forces after the fall of the Saddam regime.  Those ads ran in the districts of Congressmen and Senators that the group felt were ready to abandon the President on the war. In fact, four targets of the ad were part of the so-called ""gang of eleven"" Republicans who went to the White House to complain to President Bush about the war, right after the ad aired. Though some claimed the targets of the ad were ""vulnerable Republicans,"" some of the targets, including Reps. [[Fred Upton  and Mike Rogers, have easily won reelection in the past, and are considered ""safe"" seats.  In 2008, the Action Fund undertook two major actions that received national attention.  First, the organization, along with [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington  exposed an internal email from a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs  center in [[Temple, Texas , which read in part, ""Given that we are having more and more compensation seeking veterans, I'd like to suggest that we refrain from giving a diagnosis of PTSD straight out. Consider a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder, R/O PTSD.<ref name=""APPTSD""></ref> The exposing of the email caused Senator [[Barack Obama  to call for hearings, and for Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee in the Senate, Senator [[Daniel Akaka , to hold such hearings.<ref name=""Stars and Stripes""></ref>  The second major action was a public push for a 21st Century GI Bill, which would boost the amount troops received in education benefits. The Action Fund backed the bipartisan legislation sponsored by Senator [[Jim Webb  and Senator [[Chuck Hagel . As part of the group's efforts, it released an internet video with [[Brave New Films , urging the passage of the bill, with an attached petition, which received 30,000 signatures, according to the group. It also aired television ads, targeting Senator [[John McCain  and Senator [[John Cornyn , who did not support the bill.  ==Activity in 2010==  ===PAC disbursements===  As of the June 30, 2010 [[Federal Election Commission   FEC  filing, VoteVets PAC had disbursed almost $165,000 to candidates and other PACs during the 2010 election cycle.  ===Close Gitmo Now campaign=== In January 2010,  dozens of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans from VoteVets.org traveled to [[Washington, D.C.  to join with the Campaign to Close Guantanamo in lobbying the [[United States Congress  to close the prison at [[Guantanamo Bay . The veterans delivered a letter to a number of Congressmen and Senators, co-signed by about 2000 veterans, calling for Congress to follow President [[Barack Obama 's lead, and move to shut down the facility that they felt had become a blight on America's reputation.  ===First 2010 clean energy ad=== On February 4, 2010, VoteVets.org launched a $2 million ad campaign in seven states and Washington, D.C., pushing for a comprehensive energy bill that, according to VoteVets.org, would cut dependence on oil, and calling out those who the organization felt were putting contributions from oil interests above American interest.  The 30-second ads were directed at Senators [[Mitch McConnell , the minority leader from [[Kentucky , [[Evan Bayh , Democrat of [[Indiana , [[John Thune , Republican of [[South Dakota , [[John Barrasso , Republican of [[Wyoming , [[Richard Lugar , Republican of Indiana, [[Charles Grassley , Republican of [[Iowa , and Representative [[Mark Kirk , Republican of [[Illinois . VoteVets also launched an ad against Missouri Republican Congressman [[Roy Blunt  for his alleged acceptance of over $150,000 in contributions from oil companies who have done business with countries who have ties to terrorism. Blunt formed a Veterans for Roy Blunt group in response.  ===""Tough"" clean energy ad=== On March 4, 2010, VoteVets.org committed close to a million dollars to a powerful ad campaign—which ran nationally and in eight states - which tied [[Iran 's ability to create new and powerful weapons used against U.S. troops to American addiction to oil. It called on Congress to pass comprehensive clean energy legislation and defund America's most dangerous enemies. The ad was paid for by VoteVets.org Action Fund in coordination with Operation Free. Local versions of the ad are running in eight states, calling on Senators to provide leadership on the issue by committing to the passage of a clean energy and climate change bill.  Those states include:  Alaska  [[Mark Begich   D , [[Lisa Murkowski   R  , Indiana  [[Evan Bayh   D , [[Richard Lugar   R  , Maine  [[Olympia Snowe   R  [[Susan Collins   R  , Missouri  [[Claire McCaskill   D  , Montana  [[Max Baucus   D  [[Jon Tester   D  , North Dakota  [[Kent Conrad   D , [[Byron Dorgan   D  , Virginia  [[Jim Webb   D , [[Mark Warner   D  , and West Virginia  [[Robert Byrd   D , [[Jay Rockefeller   D  .  The ad featured Iraq War and US Army Veteran Christopher Miller, who earned a Purple Heart as the result of an explosion from an Improvised Explosive Device  IED . Miller highlights the destructive potential of a newer and more powerful explosive device, the Explosively Formed Projectile  EFP , which was brought to Iraq from Iran and then used against our troops.  Photos and news clips show the deadly capability of the weapon.  Miller noted that every time the price of a barrel of oil increases $1, Iran makes another $1.5 billion, enhancing their ability to create weapons to be used against our troops. The World oil market depends greatly upon Iranian supply and the United States, as the top consumer of oil in the world, significantly drives up oil prices.  The ad concludes by telling Congress, ""It's time to lead.  Pass Clean Energy and Climate Legislation.""  [[United States Senate|Senator  [[John Kerry , the sponsor of the bi-partisan clean energy bill on the Senate, endorsed the ad on the same day. On April 14, 2010, conservative [[Fox News  host [[Bill O'Reilly  political commentator |Bill O'Reilly  showed the ad on his television show during a segment with conservative comedian and commentator [[Dennis Miller  in which both endorsed the ad.  ===Hannity complaint=== In March 2010, VoteVets partnered with [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington  against [[Sean Hannity  and his ""Freedom Concerts"" alleging that Hannity had engaged in deceptive and illegal marketing practices by suggesting that all concert ticket sale revenue goes directly to scholarships for children of killed and wounded service members."" CREW and VoteVets filed complaints with the [[Internal Revenue Service  and the [[Federal Trade Commission  about Freedom Concerts, Freedom Alliance, and Lt. Col. [[Oliver North .  ===Clean energy poll===  In April 2010, VoteVets conducted a poll of [[Iraq  and [[Afghanistan  veterans regarding their positions on clean energy. The poll found that 73 percent of them supported Clean Energy Climate Change legislation in the [[United States Congress , 79 percent believed ending our dependence on foreign oil was important to national security, and 67 percent supported the argument that such legislation will help their own economic prospects.  The poll was conducted by Lake Research Group for VoteVets.org In February, and is made up of 45 percent self-identified [[Republican Party  United States |Republicans , 25 percent Independents, and 20 percent [[Democratic Party  United States |Democrats .  ===Oil spill ad===  In May 2010, VoteVets launched an ad campaign in response to the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill . The massive $1.5 million television and web ad campaign was the first to make the connection between the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and American national security.  The ad campaign features a veteran who served with the [[Louisiana National Guard , cleaning up the massive spill, speaking from a polluted shoreline of Louisiana.  In the ad, Louisiana resident and veteran Evan Wolf makes the point that the necessity of using the Guard to help clean up efforts takes the military away from critical national security missions.  Indeed, over 11,000 Guardsmen have been sent to the Gulf to help with the clean up.  In the ad, Wolf says, “When I signed on with the National Guard, I did it to help protect America from our enemies… Not to clean up an oil company’s mess here in the Gulf of Mexico… But America needs a new mission.  Because whether it’s deep-drilling oil out here, or spending a billion dollars a day on oil from our enemies overseas, our dependence on oil is threatening our national security.”  ""Some folks in Washington say now is not the time for clean American power.  I got to ask - if not now, when?"" he closes.  The television ad ran on national cable, with versions running in Louisiana, Florida, Maine, Washington, New Jersey, Illinois, and New Hampshire, that called on those states’ Senators to push clean legislation forward.  Legislation pending in the Senate would cut America’s foreign oil dependence in half, expand the clean energy manufacturing tax credit by $5 billion and force offshore drilling rigs further offshore.  ===Summer ad campaign===  In June 2010, VoteVets partnered with the [[League of Conservation Voters , [[Service Employees International Union , and [[Sierra Club  and announced an $11 million campaign to help ensure that the U.S. Senate takes decisive action on comprehensive energy and climate legislation that summer. This unprecedented effort is one of the largest coordinated efforts to date to educate the public on where key Senators stand on the historic fight to put America back in control of its energy future with legislation that creates new clean energy jobs, reduces our dangerous addiction to oil and curbs harmful carbon pollution.  As part of the campaign, VoteVets ran ads criticizing Senators [[Richard Burr   R-NC , [[Mike Johanns   R-NE , and [[Ben Nelson   D-NE  for opposing clean energy climate legislation.  The coalition also ran ads supporting Senators [[Claire McCaskill   D-MO  and [[Harry Reid   D-NV  for their support of the legislation.  ===Brigadier General  Ret.  Steven Anderson ad===  In July 2010, VoteVets launched an ad campaign featuring Brigadier General Steven Anderson  Ret. , Chief of Logistics in Iraq under General David Petraeus, calling for the U.S. Senate to pass a Clean Energy plan. In the ad, Anderson cited how US dependence on oil has led to American deaths in the warzone.  ===SGLI petition===  In August 2010, VoteVets helped expose an alleged scam perpetrated by banks in the disbursement of [[Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance   SGLI  funds to gold star [[service flag  families. According to VoteVets, [[Prudential Financial  and [[MetLife  had been investing life insurance benefits for service members killed and Iraq and Afghanistan and not turning the accrued interest over to the families of the deceased. VoteVets launched a petition asking Congress to hold hearings on the issue.  ===Election activity===  In September 2010, VoteVets spent $500,000 in a massive literature drop and get out the vote campaign in Pennsylvania for Democrats [[Joe Sestak , [[Patrick Murphy  Pennsylvania politician |Patrick Murphy  and [[Bryan Lentz , all Veterans. Some of the dispersed literature compared Republican Pennsylvania Senate nominee [[Pat Toomey  to Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  and criticizing his support of financial institutions over Veterans and his voted against combat bonuses for deployed troops.  Additionally, VoteVets spent time in Washington state praising the record on veterans issues of Democratic Senator Patty Murray and claiming that her Republican opponent, [[Dino Rossi , had a sub-par record on similar issues.  In October, VoteVets launched nearly $1 Million dollars in ads in Pennsylvania criticizing Republicans [[Mike Fitzpatrick  and [[Pat Toomey . That same month, VoteVets launched a $400,000 ad buy in Nevada in support of Democratic Senator [[Harry Reid . According to VoteVets, titled ""Highway,"" the ad shows a young man hiking along the road, just as Harry Reid did once a week as he went back and forth to school.  Narrated by Anthony Funches an Air Force veteran from Las Vegas, the ad chronicles how Harry Reid has always beat the odds, including his leadership to provide care and benefits to our nation's veterans.<ref name=""votevets.org""></ref>  ""Harry Reid has always been there for us,"" said [[Jon Soltz , [[Iraq War  veteran and Chairman of VoteVets.org.  ""This ad truly encapsulates how we feel about him and the dogged leadership he's provided, especially when it comes to veterans.  In very many ways, veterans coming home face the same kind of challenges that Harry Reid has always conquered - getting an education, working our way up the ladder.  So not only are we thankful for his leadership, and respect it, but we identify with his character.  That's why we've chosen to run an ad like this."".<ref name=""votevets.org""/>  Also in October 2010, VoteVets spent $350,000 on an ad in Missouri criticizing Republican Senate Candidate and Representative [[Roy Blount  for his vote against health care for [[9/11  first responders. VoteVets also spent $200,000 in Virginia to run ads criticizing Republican House candidate [[Robert Hurt  Virginia politician |Robert Hurt  for his lack of support for unemployment benefit extension which the group claimed disproportionately affected Veterans. Later that month, VoteVets announced a dramatic expansion of its ad buys in Pennsylvania and Nevada by a combined $600,000.  In all, the expansion brought VoteVets spending to $4 million during the cycle, across the country.  ===Chairman's leave of absence===  In November 2010, Iraq War veteran and chairman of the group, Jon Soltz, announced a one-year leave of absence from the organization to deploy to Iraq, as part of Operation New Dawn.  The group continued its work with an interim chairman, Iraq War veteran Ashwin Madia, who was the group's vice chairman since 2009.  The rest of the VoteVets.org infrastructure remained the same.  On December 12, 2011, Soltz returned as chairman after completing his deployment.   ==VetVoice blog==  On November 20, 2007, VoteVets.org launched a blog on politics and the military called [http://www.vetvoice.com VetVoice]. On the blog's first day, VetVoice posted messages from seven presidential candidates welcoming troops and veterans to the site. The blog is edited by [[War in Afghanistan  2001–present |Afghanistan War  veteran Richard Allen Smith.  ==General John Batiste video== In May 2007, retired Major General [[John Batiste  appeared in a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMPIi03wSfY political video] for VoteVets.org. <ref name=""CBS News1""></ref>   As part of a $500,000 campaign, variations of the video were shown in a number of congressional districts and also included two other retired generals: [[Paul D. Eaton  and [[Wesley K. Clark . <ref name=""New York Times2""></ref>  Batiste had been an Iraq War news consultant for CBS News.  However, following his appearance in the video, CBS  stated that appearing in the advertisement violated their contract, and Batiste was asked to ""vacate his position."" <ref name=""CBS News2""></ref>  ==See also==  ===Views on second United States-Iraq War===  *[[Opposition to the Iraq War  - Article about opposition  from outside Iraq  to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the Iraq War in general. *[[Views on the 2003 invasion of Iraq  - Article containing links to several topics relating to views on the invasion, and the subsequent occupation of Iraq. *Iraq: Opposing Viewpoints - A book in the [[Opposing Viewpoints series , presenting selections of contrasting viewpoints on four central questions about the Iraq War and its aftermath.  ===Other U.S. veterans' organizations===  *[[Veterans for Peace  - American organization founded in 1985 consisting of combat and peacetime veterans who work to promote alternatives to war. *[[American Legion  - A large organization of veterans of the United States armed forces who served in wartime.

On June 11, 1981, Gannett printed the first prototypes of the proposed publication. The  two proposed design layouts were mailed to newsmakers and prominent leaders in journalism, for review and feedback.<ref name=""garcia-usatoday1""/><ref name=""usatoday30.usatoday""></ref> The Gannett Company's board of directors approved the launch of the national newspaper, titled ''USA Today'', on December 5, 1981. At launch, Neuharth was appointed president and publisher of the newspaper, adding those responsibilities to his existing position as Gannett's [[chief executive officer .<ref name=""usatoday30.usatoday""/><ref name=""marking30""></ref>  Gannett announced the launch of the paper on April 20, 1982. ''USA Today'' began publishing on September 15, 1982, initially in the [[Baltimore  and [[Washington, D.C.  metropolitan areas for an newsstand price of 25¢  equivalent to ¢ today . After selling out the first issue, Gannett gradually expanded the national distribution of the paper, reaching an estimated circulation of 362,879 copies by the end of 1982, double the amount of sales that Gannett projected. The design uniquely incorporated color graphics and photographs. Initially, only its front news section pages were rendered in four-color, while the remaining pages were printed in a [[spot color  format. The paper's overall style and elevated use of graphics – developed by Neuharth, in collaboration with staff graphics designers George Rorick, Sam Ward, Suzy Parker, John Sherlock and Web Bryant – was derided by critics, who referred to it as ""[[McDonald's|McPaper "" or ""television you can wrap fish in,"" because it opted to incorporate concise nuggets of information more akin to the style of [[television news , rather than in-depth stories like traditional newspapers, which many in the newspaper industry considered to be a [[dumbing down  of the news.<ref name=""usatoday30.usatoday""/><ref name=""marking30""/><ref name=""garcia-usatoday2""></ref> Although ''USA Today'' had been profitable for just ten years as of 1997, it changed the appearance and feel of newspapers around the world.  On July 2, 1984, the newspaper switched from predominantly black-and-white to full color photography and graphics in all four sections. The next week on July 10, ''USA Today'' launched an international edition intended for U.S. readers abroad, followed four months later on October 8 with the rollout of the first transmission via satellite of its international version to [[Singapore . On April 8, 1985, the paper published its first special bonus section, a 12-page section called ""Baseball '85,"" which previewed the [[1985 Major League Baseball season .<ref name=""usatoday30.usatoday""/>  By the fourth quarter of 1985, ''USA Today'' had become the second largest newspaper in the United States, reaching a daily circulation of 1.4 million copies. Total daily readership of the paper by 1987  according to Simmons Market Research Bureau statistics  had reached 5.5 million, the largest of any daily newspaper in the U.S. On May 6, 1986, ''USA Today'' began production of its international edition in [[Switzerland . ''USA Today'' operated at a loss for most of its first four years of operation, accumulating a total deficit of $233 million after taxes, according to figures released by Gannett in July 1987; the newspaper began turning its first profit in May 1987, six months ahead of Gannett corporate revenue projections.<ref name=""usatoday30.usatoday""/>  On January 29, 1988, ''USA Today'' published the largest edition in its history, a 78-page weekend edition featuring a section previewing [[Super Bowl XXII ; the edition included 44.38 pages of advertising and sold 2,114,055 copies, setting a single-day record for an American newspaper  and surpassed seven months later on September 2, when its [[Labor Day  weekend edition sold 2,257,734 copies . On April 15, ''USA Today'' launched a third international printing site, based in [[Hong Kong . The international edition set circulation and advertising records during August 1988, with coverage of the [[1988 Summer Olympics , selling more than 60,000 copies and 100 pages of advertising.<ref name=""usatoday30.usatoday""/>  By July 1991, Simmons Market Research Bureau estimated that ''USA Today'' had a total daily readership of nearly 6.6 million, an all-time high  and the largest readership of any daily newspaper in the United States. On September 1 of that year, ''USA Today'' launched a fourth printsite for its international edition in [[London  for the [[United Kingdom  and the [[British Isles .<ref name=""usatoday30.usatoday""/> The international edition's schedule was changed as of April 1, 1994    Monday through Friday, rather than from Tuesday through Saturday, in order to accommodate business travelers; on February 1, 1995, ''USA Today'' opened its first editorial bureau outside the United States at its Hong Kong publishing facility; additional editorial bureaus were launched in London and [[Moscow  in 1996.<ref name=""usatoday30.usatoday""/>  On April 17, 1995, ''USA Today'' launched its website, www.usatoday.com, as part of the USA Today Information Network to provide real-time news coverage; the site would eventually expand to include a spin-off website that launched in June 2002, USATODAY.com Travel, providing travel information and booking tools. On August 28, 1995, a fifth international publishing site was launched in [[Frankfurt, Germany , to print and distribute the international edition throughout most of Europe.<ref name=""usatoday30.usatoday""/> On October 4, 1999, ''USA Today'' began running advertisements on its front page for the first time.<ref name=""usatoday30.usatoday"" /> In 2017, some pages of USA Today's website features the [[Auto-Play|""autoplay""  functionality for video or audio-aided stories.  On February 8, 2000, Gannett launched ''USA Today Live'', a broadcast and Internet initiative designed to provide coverage from the newspaper to broadcast television stations nationwide for use in their local newscasts and their websites; the venture would also provide integration with the ''USA Today'' website, which transitioned from a text-based format to feature audio and video clips of news content. The paper launched a sixth printing site for its international edition on May 15, 2000, in [[Milan , [[Italy , followed on July 10 by the launch of an international printing facility in [[Charleroi, Belgium .<ref name=""usatoday30.usatoday""/>  2001 saw additional expansion of the newspaper, with the launch of two interactive units: on June 19, ''USA Today'' and Gannett Newspapers launched the USA Today Careers Network  now [[Careers.com  , a website featuring localized employment listings, then on July 18, the USA Today News Center was launched as an interactive television news service developed through a joint venture with the On Command Corporation that was distributed to hotels around the United States. On September 12 of that year, the newspaper set an all-time single day circulation record, selling 3,638,600 copies for its edition covering the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks  that destroyed the [[World Trade Center  1973–2001 |World Trade Center  and damaged [[The Pentagon  and a hijacking attempt tied to the two events that resulted in the crash of [[United Airlines Flight 93  outside [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania . That November, ''USA Today'' migrated its operations from Gannett's previous corporate headquarters in [[Arlington, Virginia  to the company's new headquarters in nearby [[McLean, Virginia|McLean .<ref name=""usatoday30.usatoday""/>  On December 12, 2005, Gannett announced that it would combine the separate newsroom operations of ''USA Today''s online and print entities, with USAToday.com's vice president and editor-in-chief Kinsey Wilson being promoted to co-executive editor, alongside existing executive editor John Hillkirk.<ref name=""usatoday30.usatoday""/> In 2010, ''USA Today'' launched the USA Today [[API  for sharing data with partners of all types.  ===Newsroom restructuring and 2011 graphical tweaks=== On August 27, 2010, ''USA Today'' announced that it would undergo a reorganization of its newsroom, announcing the layoffs of 130 staffers. It also announced that the paper would shift its focus away from print and place more emphasis on its digital platforms  including USAToday.com and its related [[mobile app lications  and launch of a new publication called ''USA Today Sports''.  On January 24, 2011, to reverse a revenue slide, the paper introduced a tweaked format that modified the appearance of its front section pages, which included a larger logo at the top of each page; coloring tweaks to section front pages; a new [[sans-serif  font, called Prelo, for certain headlines of main stories  replacing the Gulliver typeface that had been implemented for story headers in April 2000 ; an updated ""Newsline"" feature featuring larger, ""newsier"" headline entry points; and the increasing and decreasing of [[Masthead  publishing |mastheads  and white space to present a cleaner style.  ===2012 redesign=== [[File:Miguel Vazquez from USA Today shows off their beautiful Metro App  6857362418 .jpg|thumb|Miguel Vazquez from ''USA Today'' shows off the publication's Metro App, 2012.  On September 14, 2012, ''USA Today'' underwent the first major redesign in its history, in commemoration for the 30th anniversary of the paper's first edition. Developed in conjunction with brand design firm [[Wolff Olins , the print edition of ''USA Today'' added a page covering technology stories and expanded travel coverage within the Life section and increased the number of color pages included in each edition, while retaining longtime elements.<ref name=""Hagey""></ref> The ""globe"" logo used since the paper's inception was replaced with a new logo featuring a large circle rendered in colors corresponding to each of the sections, serving as an infographic that changes with news stories, containing images representing that day's top stories.<ref name=""Hagey""/><ref name=""garcia-usatoday5""></ref>  The paper's website was also extensively overhauled using a new, in-house [[content management system  known as Presto and a design created by Fantasy Interactive, that incorporates flipboard-style navigation to switch between individual stories  which obscure most of the main and section pages , clickable video advertising and a [[responsive design  layout. The site was designed to be more interactive, provide optimizations for [[mobile device|mobile  and [[touchscreen  devices, provide ""high impact"" advertising units, and provide the ability for Gannett to syndicate USA Today content to the websites of its local properties, and vice versa. To accomplish this goal, Gannett migrated its newspaper and television station websites to the Presto platform and the USA Today site design throughout 2013 and 2014  although archive content accessible through [[search engines  remains available through the pre-relaunch design .<ref name=poynter-gannettpresto></ref><ref name=""garcia-usatoday6""></ref>  ===Mid-2010s expansion and restructuring=== On October 6, 2013, Gannett test launched a daily ""butterfly"" edition of ''USA Today'' for distribution as an insert in four of its newspapers – ''[[The Indianapolis Star '', the ''[[Rochester Democrat & Chronicle '', the [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers -based ''[[The News-Press|News-Press '' and the [[Appleton, Wisconsin -based ''[[The Post-Crescent|Post-Crescent ''. The launch of the syndicated insert caused ''USA Today'' to restructure its operations to allow seven-day-a-week production to accommodate the packaging of its national and international news content and enterprise stories  comprising about 10 pages for the weekday and Saturday editions, and up to 22 pages for the Sunday edition  into the pilot insert. Gannett later announced on December 11, that it would formally launch the condensed daily edition of ''USA Today'' in 31 additional local newspapers nationwide through April 2014  with the [[Palm Springs, California -based ''[[The Desert Sun|Desert Sun '' and the [[Lafayette, Louisiana -based ''Advertiser'' being the first newspapers outside of the pilot program participants to add the supplement on December 15 , citing ""positive feedback"" to the feature from readers and advertisers of the initial four papers. Gannett was given permission from the [[Alliance for Audited Media  to count the circulation figures from the syndicated local insert with the total circulation count for the flagship national edition of ''USA Today''.  On January 4, 2014, ''USA Today'' acquired the book and film review website, Reviewed.com.<ref name=""usatoday30.usatoday""/> In the first quarter of 2014, Gannett launched a condensed ''USA Today'' insert into 31 other newspapers in its network, thereby increasing the number of inserts to 35, in an effort to shore up ''USA Today''s circulation after it regained its position as the highest circulated weekdaily newspaper in the United States in October 2013.<ref name=""USA Today distribution""></ref> On September 3, 2014, ''USA Today'' announced that it would lay off roughly 70 employees in a restructuring of its newsroom and business operations. In October 2014, ''USA Today'' and OpenWager Inc. entered into a partnership to release a [[Online bingo#Mobile Bingo|Bingo  app called USA TODAY Bingo Cruise.  On December 3, 2015, Gannett formally launched the USA Today Network, a national digital newsgathering service providing shared content between ''USA Today'' and the company's 92 local newspapers throughout the United States as well as pooling advertising services on both a hyperlocal and national reach. The ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal '' had earlier soft-launched the service as part of a pilot program started on November 17, coinciding with an imaging rebrand for the [[Louisville, Kentucky -based newspaper; Gannett's other local newspaper properties, as well as those it acquired through its merger with the [[Journal Media Group , began identifying themselves as part of the USA Today Network  foregoing use of the Gannett name outside of requisite ownership references  gradually integrated into the USA Today Network through early January 2016.  ==Layout and format== [[File:USA Today cover page.jpg|thumb|This February 5, 2009 issue of ''USA Today'' shows the old layout and logo of the paper prior to its 2012 redesign.   ''USA Today'' is known for synthesizing news down to easy-to-read-and-comprehend stories. In the main edition circulated in the United States and some [[Canada|Canadian  cities, each edition consists of four sections: News  the oft-labeled ""front page"" section , Money, Sports, and Life. Since March 1998, the Friday edition of Life has been separated into two distinct sections: the regular Life focusing on entertainment  subtitled ''Weekend''; section E , which features television reviews and listings, a DVD column, [[Film criticism|film reviews  and trends, and a travel supplement called ''Destinations & Diversions''  section D . The international edition of the paper features two sections: News and Money in one; with Sports and Life in the other.  Atypical of most daily newspapers, the paper does not print on Saturdays and Sundays; the Friday edition serves as the weekend edition  although ''USA Today'' has published special Saturday and Sunday editions in the past, the first being published on January 19, 1991, when it released a Saturday ""Extra"" edition updating coverage of the [[Gulf War  from the previous day; the paper published special seven-day-a-week editions for the first time on July 19, 1996, when it published special editions for exclusive distribution in the host city of [[Atlanta  and surrounding areas for the two-week duration of the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics  .<ref name=""usatoday30.usatoday""/> ''USA Today'' prints each complete story on the front page of the respective section with the exception of the cover story. The cover story is a longer story that requires a jump  readers must turn to another page in the paper to complete the story, usually the next page of that section . On certain days, the news or sports section will take up two paper sections, and there will be a second cover story within the second section.  Each section is denoted by a certain color to differentiate sections beyond lettering and is seen in a box the top-left corner of the first page; the principal section colors are blue for News  section A , green for Money  section B , red for Sports  section C , and purple for Life  section D ; in the paper's early years, the Life and Money sections were also assigned blue nameplates and spot color, as the presses used at ''USA Today'' printing facilities did not yet accommodate the use of other colors to denote all four original sections.<ref name=""garcia-usatoday4""></ref> Orange is used for bonus sections  section E or above , which are published occasionally such as for [[business travel  trends and the [[Olympic Games|Olympics ; other bonus sections for sports  such as for the [[PGA Tour  preview, [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Basketball Tournaments , [[Memorial Day  auto races  [[Indianapolis 500  and [[Coca-Cola 600  , [[National Football League|NFL  opening weekend and the [[Super Bowl   previously used the orange color, but now use the red designated for sports in their bonus sections. To increase their ties to ''USA Today'', Gannett incorporated the ''USA Today'' coloring scheme into an internally created graphics package for news programming that the company began phasing in across its television station group – which were spun-off in July 2015 into the separate broadcast and digital media company [[Tegna, Inc.|Tegna  – in late 2012  the package utilizes the color scheme for a rundown graphic used on most stations – outside those that Gannett acquired in 2014 from London Broadcasting, which began implementing the package in late 2015 – that persists throughout its stations' newscasts, as well as bumpers for individual story topics . Gannett's television stations began to a new on-air appearance that uses a color-coding system identical to that of the paper.<ref name=tvnc-newgraphics></ref>  [[File:USA Today Logo.svg|upright=0.8|thumb|left|Original logo, used from 1982 to 2012.  In many ways, ''USA Today'' is set up to break the typical newspaper layout. Some examples of that divergence from tradition include using the left-hand quarter of each section as reefers  front-page paragraphs referring to stories on inside pages , sometimes using sentence-length blurbs to describe stories inside; the lead reefer is the cover page feature ""Newsline,"" which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured in all four main sections and any special sections. As a national newspaper, ''USA Today'' cannot focus on the weather for any one city. Therefore, the entire back page of the News section is used for weather maps for the [[continental United States , [[Puerto Rico  and the [[United States Virgin Islands , and temperature lists for many cities throughout the U.S. and the world  temperatures for individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are suffixed with a one- or two-letter code, such as ""t"" for [[thunderstorm s, referencing the expected weather conditions ; the colorized forecast map, originally created by staff designer George Rorick  who left ''USA Today'' for a similar position at ''[[The Detroit News '' in 1986 , was copied by newspapers around the world, breaking from the traditional style of using monochrome contouring or simplistic text to denote temperature ranges.<ref name=""garcia-usatoday2""/><ref name=""garcia-usatoday3""></ref> National precipitation maps for the next three days  previously five days until the 2012 redesign , and four-day forecasts and [[Air Quality Index es for 36 major U.S. cities  originally 16 cities prior to 1999  – with individual cities color-coded by the temperature contour corresponding to the given area on the forecast map – are also featured. Weather data is provided by [[AccuWeather , which has served as the forecast provider for ''USA Today'' for most of the paper's existence  with an exception from January 2002 to September 2012, when [[The Weather Channel  provided data through a long-term multimedia content agreement with Gannett . In the bottom left-hand corner of the weather page is ""Weather Focus"", a graphic which explains various meteorological phenomena. On some days, the Weather Focus could be a photo of a rare meteorological event.  On Mondays, the Money section uses its back page for ""Market Trends,"" a feature that launched in June 2002 and presents an unusual graphic depicting the performance of various industry groups as a function of quarterly, monthly, and weekly movements against the [[S&P 500 . On days featuring bonus sections or business holidays, the Money and Life sections are usually combined into one section, while combinations of the Friday Life editions into one section are common during quiet weeks. Advertising coverage is seen in the Monday Money section, which often includes a review of a current television ad, and after [[Super Bowl Sunday , a review of the ads aired during the broadcast with the results of the ''Ad Track'' live survey. Stock tables for individual stock exchanges  comprising one subsection for companies traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange , and another for companies trading on [[NASDAQ  and the [[American Stock Exchange   and mutual indexes were discontinued with the 2012 redesign due to the myriad of electronic ways to check individual stock prices, in line with most newspapers.  Book coverage, including reviews and a national sales chart  the latter of which debuted on October 28, 1994 , is seen on Thursdays in Life, with the official full [[A.C. Nielsen  [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings  chart printed on Wednesdays or Thursdays, depending on release. The paper also publishes the [[Mediabase  survey for several genres of music, based on radio airplay spins on Tuesdays, along with their own chart of the top ten singles in general on Wednesdays. Because of the same limitations cited for its nationalized forecasts, the television page in Life – which provides [[prime time  and [[late night television|late night  listings  running from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 12:30&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time   – incorporates a boilerplate ""[[Local news "" or ""[[Local programming "" descriptions to denote time periods in which the five major English language broadcast networks  [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC , [[NBC , [[CBS , [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox  and [[The CW   cede airtime to allow their affiliates to carry [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programs  or local newscasts; the television page has never been accompanied by a weekly listings supplement with broader scheduling information similar to those featured in local newspapers. Like most national papers, ''USA Today'' does not carry [[comic strip s.  [[File:USA Today building.jpg|thumb|left|''USA Today'' is headquartered in [[Tysons Corner, Virginia <!-- Despite the McLean, VA address, the HQ is in Tysons Corner -->.  One of the staples of the News section is ""Across the USA,"" a state-by-state roundup of headlines. The summaries consist of paragraph-length [[Associated Press  reports highlighting one story of note in each state, the [[District of Columbia , and one U.S. territory. Similarly, the ""For the Record"" page of the Sports section  which features sports scores for both the previous four days of league play and individual non-league events, seasonal league statistics and wagering lines for the current day's games  also features a rundown of winning numbers from the previous deadline date for [[Lotteries in the United States|all participating state lotteries  and individual multi-state lotteries.  Some traditions have been retained, however. The [[news style|lead story  still appears on the upper-right hand of the front page. Commentary and political cartoons occupy the last few pages of the News section. Stock and mutual fund data are presented in the Money section. But ''USA Today'' is sufficiently different in aesthetics to be recognized on sight, even in a mix of other newspapers, such as at a [[newsstand . The overall design and layout of ''USA Today'' has been described as neo-Victorian.  Also, in most of the sections' front pages, on the lower left hand corner, are ""USA Today Snapshots"", which give statistics of various lifestyle interests according to the section it is in  for example, a snapshot in ""Life"" could show how many people tend to watch a certain genre of television show based upon the type of mood they are in at the time . These ""Snapshots"" are shown through graphs which are made up of various illustrations of objects that roughly pertain to the graphs subject matter  using the example above, the graph's bars could be made up of several TV sets, or ended by one . These are usually loosely based on research by a national institute  with the credited source mentioned in fine print in the box below the graph .  The newspaper also features an occasional magazine supplement called ''Open Air'', which launched on March 7, 2008 and appears several times a year. Various other [[advertorial s appear throughout the year, mainly on Fridays.  ===Opinion section=== The opinion section prints ''USA Today'' editorials, columns by guest writers and members of the Editorial Board of Contributors, letters to the editor, and editorial cartoons. One unique feature of the ''USA Today'' editorial page is the publication of opposing points of view; alongside the editorial board's piece on the day's topic runs an opposing view by a guest writer, often an expert in the field. The opinion pieces featured in each edition are decided by the Board of Contributors, which are separate from the paper's news staff.<ref name=""usatoday""></ref>  , the editorial page editor was Brian Gallagher, who has worked for the newspaper since its founding in 1982. Other members of the Editorial Board included deputy editorial page editor Bill Sternberg, executive forum editor John Siniff, op-ed/forum page editor Glen Nishimura, operations editor Thuan Le Elston, letters editor Michelle Poblete, web content editor Eileen Rivers, and editorial writers Dan Carney, George Hager, and Saundra Torry. The newspaper's website calls this group ""demographically and ideologically diverse.""<ref name=""usatoday""/>  ''USA Today'' has traditionally maintained a policy not to endorse candidates for the [[President of the United States|United States Presidency  or any other state or federal political office, which it has refrained from doing since its inception. Since [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 , its political editorials during the Presidential election cycle has focused instead on providing opinion on major issues relevant to the campaign based on the differing concerns of voters, the vast amount of information on ongoing Presidential campaigns, and the Board of Contributors' aim to provide a fair viewpoint through the diverse political ideologies of its members and avoid reader perceptions of bias. However, the board re-evaluates its non-endorsement policy through an independent process during each four-year election cycle, with any decision to circumvent the policy based on a consensus vote in which fewer than two of the editorial board's members dissent or hold differing opinions.<ref name=""usatoday-breakingtradition""></ref>  The editorial board broke from this stance for the first time on September 29, 2016, when it published an op-ed piece condemning the candidacy of [[Republican Party  United States |Republican  nominee [[Donald Trump , calling him ""unfit for the presidency"" due to his inflammatory campaign rhetoric  particularly that aimed at military veterans, immigrants, and various ethnic and religious groups ; his temperament and lack of financial transparency; his ""checkered"" business record; his use of false and hyperbolic statements; the inconsistency of his viewpoints and issues with his vision on domestic and foreign policy; and, based on comments he has made during his campaign and criticisms by both [[Democratic Party  United States |Democrats  and Republicans on these views, the potential risks to national security and constitutional ethics under a Trump administration, asking voters to ""resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue"". The board noted that the piece was not a ""qualified endorsement"" of Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton , for whom the board was unable to reach a consensus for endorsing  some editorial board members expressed that Clinton's public service record would help her ""serve the nation ably as its president,"" while others had ""serious reservations about [her] sense of entitlement, [...] lack of candor and [...] [[Hillary Clinton email controversy|extreme carelessness in handling classified information "" , instead advising voters to decide whether to vote for Clinton, [[Libertarian Party  United States |Libertarian  nominee [[Gary Johnson , [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party  nominee [[Jill Stein  or a write-in candidate; or focus on Senate, House and other down-ballot political races.  In February 2018, ''USA Today'' stirred controversy by publishing an op-ed by Jerome Corsi, the DC bureau chief for the fringe conspiracy website InfoWars.<ref name="":0""></ref> Corsi, a prominent conspiracy theorist, was described by ''USA Today'' as an ""author"" and ""investigative journalist"".<ref name="":0"" /> Corsi was a prominent proponent of the false conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not a US citizen, and Infowars has promoted conspiracy theories such as 9/11 being an inside job and the Sandy Hook massacre being a hoax staged by child actors.<ref name="":0"" />  In October 2018, ''USA Today'' was criticized for publishing an editorial by President Donald Trump that was replete with inaccuracies. ''The Washington Post'' fact-checker noted that ""almost every sentence contained a misleading statement or a falsehood.""  ==Personnel== In May 2012, Larry Kramer – a 40-year media industry veteran and former president of CBS Digital Media – was appointed president and publisher of ''USA Today'', replacing [[David Hunke , who had been publisher of the newspaper since 2009. Kramer was tasked with developing a new strategy for the paper as it sought to increase revenue from its digital operations.  In July 2012, Kramer hired [[David Callaway  USA Today |David Callaway  – whom the former had hired as lead editor of ''[[MarketWatch '' in 1999, two years after Kramer founded the website  – as the paper's editor-in-chief. Callaway had previously worked at [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg  covering the banking, investment-banking and asset-management businesses throughout Europe and at the ''[[Boston Herald '', where he co-wrote a daily financial column on ""comings and goings in the Boston business district"".

It was first published on April 5, 1991 as ''USA Today Baseball Weekly'', a [[tabloid  paper size |tabloid -sized baseball-focused publication released on Wednesdays, on a weekly basis during the baseball season and bi-weekly during the off-season; the magazine expanded its sports coverage on September 4, 2002, when it adopted its current title after added stories about the NFL. ''Sports Weekly'' added coverage of NASCAR on February 15, 2006, lasting only during that year's race season; and added coverage of NCAA college football on August 8, 2007. The editorial operations of ''Sports Weekly'' originally operated autonomously from ''USA Today'', before being integrated with the newspaper's sports department in late 2005.  ===The Big Lead===  '''The Big Lead''' is a sports [[blog  operated by ''USA Today'' that was launched in February 2006 by original owner Fantasy Sports Ventures  co-founded by Jason McIntyre and David Lessa , which was purchased by the Gannett Company – which, beginning in April 2008, had maintained a strategic content and marketing partnership with the former company – in January 2012. The site – which is usually updated on a routine basis of 10 to 15 times per day between 8:00&nbsp;a.m. and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time – mainly covers sports, but also provides news and commentary on other news topics, ranging from politics to [[pop culture .  ===''USA Today: The Television Show''===  |image =  |genre = [[News broadcasting|News program  |creator = [[Grant Tinker  |country = United States |language = [[English language|English  |company = [[Grant Tinker|GTG East  |network =  [[Broadcast syndication|Syndication  |first_aired =  |last_aired =    In 1987, Gannett and producer [[Grant Tinker  began developing a [[newsmagazine  series for [[Broadcast syndication|first-run syndication  that attempted to bring the breezy style of ''USA Today'' to television. The result was ''USA Today: The Television Show''  later retitled ''USA Today on TV'', then shortened to simply ''USA Today'' , which premiered on September 12, 1988. Correspondents on the program included Edie Magnus, [[Robin Young , [[Boyd Matson , Kenneth Walker, Dale Harimoto, Ann Abernathy, [[Bill Macatee  and Beth Ruyak. As with the newspaper itself, the show was divided into four ""sections"" corresponding to the different parts of the paper: News  focusing on the major headlines of the day , Money  focusing on financial news and consumer reports , Sports  focusing on sports news and scores  and Life  focusing on entertainment and lifestyle-related stories .  The series was plagued by low ratings and negative reviews from critics throughout its run. The program also suffered from being scheduled in undesirable timeslots in certain markets; this was a particular case in [[New York City , the country's largest [[media market , where CBS [[owned-and-operated station  [[WCBS-TV   channel 2  aired the program in a pre-dawn early morning slot, before the program moved to NBC O&O [[WNBC  five months into its run in a 9:30&nbsp;a.m. slot, where it did not fare any better despite being placed in a more palatable time period  in contrast, [[CITY-DT|CITY-TV  in [[Toronto , [[Ontario , [[Canada  [now the [[flagship  broadcasting |flagship station  of the [[City  TV network |City  television network], ran it at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. .  These setbacks led to the cancellation of the TV version of ''USA Today'' in November 1989 after one-and-a-half seasons; the final edition aired on January 7, 1990.  Gannett announced plans to develop a ''USA Today''-branded weekly half-hour television program, to have been titled ""Sports Page"", as part of a renewed initiative to extend the brand into television; this program, which was tapped for a fall 2004 debut, ultimately never launched.<ref name=""usatoday30.usatoday""/>  ===''VRtually There''=== ''VRtually There'' is a weekly [[virtual reality  news program produced by the USA Today Network, which debuted on October 20, 2016. The program, which is available on the ''USA Today'' mobile app and on [[YouTube   which maintains content exclusivity through the program's dedicated channel for 60 days after each broadcast , showcases three original segments outlining news stories through a first-person perspective, recorded and produced by journalists from ''USA Today'' and its co-owned local newspapers. The program also incorporates ""cubemercials,"" long-form advertisements created by Gannett's in-house creative studio GET Creative, which are designed to allow consumer engagenent in fully immersive experiences through virtual reality.  ==Awards== * [[USA Today Minor League Player of the Year Award  – First presented in 1988, this annual award has been given to a particular [[Minor league baseball|Minor League Baseball  player judged to have had the most outstanding season by a thirteen-person panel of baseball experts. * [[USA Today All-USA high school baseball team  – First presented in 1998, the award honors between nine and eleven outstanding baseball players from high schools around the United States to be part on the team  separate awards honoring the High School Baseball Player of the Year and High School Baseball Coach of the Year have been given since 1989<ref name=BaseballPlayersAndCoaches></ref><ref name=""usatoday7""></ref> . * [[USA Today All-USA high school basketball team  – First presented in 1983, the award honors outstanding male and female basketball players from high schools around the United States with a place on the team, with one member of each team being named as the High School Basketball Player of the Year as well as coaches from a select boys' and girls' team as the High School Basketball Coach of the Year.<ref name=""usatoday7""/><ref name=""usatoday7""/> * USA Today All-Joe Team  NFL  – First presented in 1992 in tribute to [[Kansas City Chiefs  veteran defensive lineman [[Joe Phillips , the award honors 52 rookie players from throughout the NFL for their exemplary performance during the previous league season. * ''USA Today''/National Prep Poll [[High School Football National Championship  – Predating the first publication of ''USA Today'' under the sole decision of the National Prep Poll, it is a national championship honor awarded to the best [[high school football  team s  in the United States, based on rankings decided by ''USA Today''s sports editorial department. * [[USA Today All-USA high school football team  – First presented in 1982, the award honors outstanding football players from high schools around the United States  includes ranks for the Super 25 teams in the U.S. and Top 10 teams in the East, South, Midwest and West, and [[USA Today High School Football Player of the Year  .  * [[USA Today High School Football Coach of the Year  – First presented in 1982, the award awards a coach from one of the teams selected for the All-USA football team for the honor.  ==In popular culture== [[File:USA Today BTTF Logo.png|upright=1.15|right|thumb|The futuristic logo used in ''Back to the Future Part II''  A futuristic 2015 edition of ''USA Today''  [[Hill Valley  Back to the Future |Hill Valley  edition  is seen in the film ''[[Back to the Future Part II ''  1989 .

It was founded in 1865 as ''The Daily Dramatic Chronicle'' by teenage brothers [[Charles de Young  and [[M. H. de Young|Michael H. de Young . The paper is currently owned by the [[Hearst Corporation , which bought it from the de Young family in 2000. It is the only major daily paper covering the city and county of San Francisco.  The paper benefited from the growth of [[San Francisco  and was the largest circulation newspaper on the [[West Coast of the United States  by 1880. Like many other newspapers, it has experienced a rapid fall in circulation in the early 21st century, and was ranked 24th by circulation nationally for the six months to March 2010. The newspaper publishes two web sites: and '''''sfchronicle.com''''', which closely reflects the articles that appear in the print paper, and '''''SFGate''''', which has a mixture of online news and web features.    ==History== The ''Chronicle'' was founded by brothers [[Charles de Young|Charles  and [[M. H. de Young  in 1865 as ''The Daily Dramatic Chronicle'', and inside of 10 years, it had the largest circulation of any newspaper west of the Mississippi River. The paper's first office was in a building at the corner of Bush and Kearney Streets. The brothers then commissioned a building from [[Burnham and Root  at 690 Market Street at the corner of Third and Kearney Streets to be their new headquarters, in what became known as [[Newspaper Row  San Francisco |Newspaper Row . The new building, San Francisco's first skyscraper, was completed in 1889.  It was damaged in the 1906 earthquake, but it was rebuilt under the direction of William Polk, Burnham's associate in San Francisco. That building, known as the ""Old Chronicle Building"" or the ""DeYoung Building"", still stands and was restored in 2007. It is an historic landmark and is the location of the Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences.<ref name=spur />  In 1924, the ''Chronicle'' commissioned a new headquarters at 901 Mission Street on the corner of 5th Street in what is now the South of Market  SoMa  neighborhood of San Francisco. It was designed by Charles Peter Weeks and William Peyton Day in the [[Gothic Revival architecture  style, but most of the Gothic Revival detailing was removed in 1968 when the building was re-clad with stucco. This building remains the Chronicle's headquarters in 2017, although other concerns are located there as well.<ref name=spur />  Between [[World War II  and 1971, new editor [[Scott Newhall  took a bold and somewhat provocative approach to news presentation. Newhall's ''Chronicle'' included investigative reporting by such journalists as [[Pierre Salinger , who later played a prominent role in national politics, and [[Paul Avery , the staffer who pursued the trail of the self-named ""[[Zodiac Killer "", who sent a [[cryptogram  in three sections in letters to the ''Chronicle'' and two other papers during his murder spree in the late 1960s. It also featured such colorful columnists as [[Pauline Phillips , who wrote under the name ""[[Dear Abby ,"" ""Count Marco""  Marc Spinelli , [[Stanton Delaplane , Terence O'Flaherty, [[Lucius Beebe , [[Art Hoppe ,  [[Charles McCabe , and [[Herb Caen .  The newspaper grew in circulation to become the city's largest, overtaking the rival ''[[San Francisco Examiner ''. The demise of other San Francisco dailies through the late 1950s and early 1960s left the ''Examiner'' and the ''Chronicle'' to battle for circulation and readership superiority.  ===Joint operating agreement  JOA ===  The competition between the ''Chronicle'' and ''Examiner'' took a financial toll on both papers until the summer of 1965, when a merger of sorts created a [[Joint Operating Agreement  under which the ''Chronicle'' became the city's sole morning daily while the ''Examiner'' changed to afternoon publication  which ultimately led to a declining readership .  The newspapers were officially owned by the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, which managed sales and distribution for both newspapers and was charged with ensuring that one newspaper's circulation did not grow at the expense of the other. Revenue was split equally, which led to a situation widely understood to benefit the ''Examiner'', since the ''Chronicle'', which had a circulation four times larger than its rival, subsidized the afternoon newspaper.<ref name=""AJRBattle1"">Gorney, Cynthia Gorney  January/February 1999 . [http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3293 ""The State of The American Newspaper - The Battle Of the Bay""]. ajr.org. ''[[American Journalism Review ''. Retrieved 2012-11-17.</ref>  The two newspapers produced a joint Sunday edition, with the ''Examiner'' publishing the news sections and the Sunday magazine and the ''Chronicle'' responsible for the tabloid entertainment section and the book review. From 1965 on the two papers shared a single classified-advertising operation. This arrangement stayed in place until the Hearst Corporation took full control of the ''Chronicle'' in 2000.  ===Push into the suburbs=== [[File:Jack Breibart and Bill German.jpg|thumb|250px|Bill German  left , the ''Chronicle''s editor emeritus, and page-one editor Jack Breibart in the newsroom, March 1994   Beginning in the early 1990s, the ''Chronicle'' started to face competition beyond the borders of San Francisco. The newspaper had long enjoyed a wide reach as the de facto ""newspaper of record"" in Northern California, with distribution along the Central Coast, the Inland Empire and even as far as Honolulu, Hawaii. There was little competition in the Bay Area suburbs and other areas that the newspaper served, but as Knight Ridder consolidated the San Jose Mercury News in 1975; purchased Contra Costa Times in 1995; and while Media News Group  Denver  purchased all other East Bay newspapers by 1985, the ''Chronicle'' realized it had to step up its suburban coverage.  The ''Chronicle'' launched five zoned sections to appear in the Friday edition of the paper. The sections covered San Francisco, and four different suburban areas. They each featured a unique columnist, enterprise pieces and local news specific to the community. The newspaper added 40 full-time staff positions to work in the suburban bureaus. Despite the push to focus on suburban coverage, the ''Chronicle'' was hamstrung by the Sunday edition, which, being produced by the San Francisco-centric ""un-''Chronicle''"" ''Examiner'', had none of the focus on the suburban communities that the ''Chronicle'' was striving to cultivate.<ref name=""AJRBattle2""></ref>  ===Sale to Hearst===  The de Young family controlled the paper, via the [[Chronicle Publishing Company , until July 27, 2000, when it was sold to [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Communications, Inc. , which owned the ''Examiner''. Following the sale, the Hearst Corporation transferred the ''Examiner'' to the Fang family, publisher of the ''[[San Francisco Independent '' and ''[[AsianWeek '', along with a $66-million subsidy.<ref name=""subsidy""></ref> Under the new owners, the ''Examiner'' became a free [[Tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid , leaving the ''Chronicle'' as the only daily [[broadsheet  newspaper in San Francisco.  In 1949, the de Young family founded [[KRON-TV   Channel 4 , the Bay Area's third television station. Until the mid-1960s, the station  along with KRON-FM , operated from the basement of the Chronicle Building, on Mission Street. KRON moved to studios at 1001 Van Ness Avenue  on the former site of St. Mary's Cathedral, which burned down in 1962 . KRON was sold to [[Young Broadcasting  in 2000 and, after years of being San Francisco's [[NBC  affiliate, became an independent station on January 1, 2002 when NBC—tired of Chronicle's repeated refusal to sell KRON to the network and, later, Young's asking price for the station being too high—purchased [[KNTV  in San Jose from [[Granite Broadcasting Corporation  for $230 million.<ref name=""KNTV""></ref>  [[File:JOHNSIAS1999.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Chronicle'' CEO John Sias announces the sale of the newspaper to the [[Hearst Corporation , August 6, 1999   Since the Hearst Corporation took ownership in 2000 the ''Chronicle'' has made periodic changes to its organization and design, but on February 1, 2009, as the newspaper began its 145th year of publication, the ''Chronicle'' Sunday edition introduced a redesigned paper featuring a modified logo, new section and page organization, new features, bolder, colored section-front banners and new headline and text typography. The frequent bold-faced, all-capital-letter headlines typical of the ''Chronicle'''s front page were eliminated. Editor Ward Bushee's note heralded the issue as the start of a ""new era"" for the ''Chronicle''.  On July 6, 2009, the paper unveiled some alterations to the new design that included yet newer section fronts and wider use of color photographs and graphics. In a special section publisher Frank J. Vega described new, state-of-the-art printing operations enabling the production of what he termed ""A Bolder, Brighter ''Chronicle''.""  The newer look was accompanied by a reduction in size of the broadsheet. Such moves are similar to those made by other prominent American newspapers such as the ''[[Chicago Tribune '' and ''[[Orlando Sentinel '', which in 2008 unveiled radically new designs even as changing reader demographics and general economic conditions necessitated physical reductions of the newspapers.  On November 9, 2009, the ''Chronicle'' became the first newspaper in the nation to print on high-quality glossy paper. The high-gloss paper is used for some section fronts and inside pages.  ==Staff== [[File:MATIER&ROSS.jpg|thumb|250px|""Chronicle Insider"" columnists Phil Matier and Andrew Ross in the newsroom   As of 2018 the publisher of the ''Chronicle'' is Bill Nagel.

''San Francisco Chronicle''. Retrieved 2012-11-17.</ref> As well as publishing the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' online, SFGate and SFChronicle.com add other features not available in the [[Publishing|print  version, such as blogs and podcasts. SFGate was one of the earliest major market newspaper websites to be launched, having done so in 1994, at the time of [[The Newspaper Guild  [[San Francisco newspaper strike of 1994|strike ; meanwhile the union published its own news website, ''San Francisco Free Press''. SFGate is the fifth largest newspaper website in America with over 33 million unique visitors each month.  ==Praise, criticism and features== The paper has received the [[Pulitzer Prize  on a number of occasions. Despite an illustrious and long history, the paper's news reportage is not as extensive as in the past. The current day ''Chronicle'' has followed the trend of other American newspapers, devoting increasing attention to local and regional news and cultural and entertainment criticism to the detriment of the paper's traditionally strong national and international reporting, though the paper does maintain a Washington, D.C., bureau. This increased focus on local news is a response to the competition from other Bay Area newspapers including the resurrected ''[[San Francisco Examiner '', the ''[[Oakland Tribune '', the ''[[Contra Costa Times '' and the ''[[San Jose Mercury News ''.  [[Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada  received the [[George Polk Awards|2004 George Polk Award  for Sports Reporting.<ref name=""polk""></ref>  Fainaru-Wada and Williams were recognized for their work on uncovering the [[BALCO  scandal, which linked [[San Francisco Giants  star [[Barry Bonds  to performance-enhancing drugs. While the two above-named reporters broke the news, they are by no means the only sports writers of note at the ''Chronicle''. The ''Chronicle''s sports section, edited by Al Saracevic and called ''Sporting Green'' as it is printed on green-tinted pages, is staffed by a dozen writers. The section's best-known writers are its columnists: Bruce Jenkins, Ann Killion, Scott Ostler, Saracevic and Tom Stienstra. Its baseball coverage is anchored by Henry Schulman, John Shea and [[Susan Slusser , the first female president of the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America   BBWAA .  Another area of note is the architecture column by John King; the Chronicle is still one of the few American papers to present a regular column on architectural issues. The paper also has regular weekly sections devoted to Food & Home and Style.  ==Challenges== Circulation has fallen sharply since the heyday of the [[dot-com bubble|dot-com boom  from 1997 to 2001. The ''Chronicle'''s daily readership dropped by 16.6% between 2004 and 2005 to 400,906;<ref name=""circulation""></ref> The ''Chronicle'' fired one quarter of its newsroom staff in a cost-cutting move in May 2007. Newspaper executives pointed to growth of SFGate, the online website with 5.2 million unique visitors per month - fifth among U.S. newspaper websites in 2007.  In February 2009, Hearst chief executive Frank A. Bennack Jr., and Hearst President Steven R. Swartz, announced that the ''Chronicle'' had lost money every year since 2001 and more than $50 million in 2008. Without major concessions from employees and other cuts, Hearst would put the papers up for sale and if no buyer was found, shut the paper. San Francisco would have become the first major American city without a daily newspaper. The cuts were made.  In spite of, or perhaps because of the threats, the loss of readers and advertisers accelerated. On October 26, 2009, the Audit Bureau of Circulations reported that the ''Chronicle'' had suffered a 25.8% drop in circulation for the six-month period ending September 2009, to 251,782 subscribers, the largest percentage drop in circulation of any major newspaper in the United States.<ref name=""circulation_oct_09""></ref>  ''Chronicle'' publisher Frank Vega said the drop was expected as the paper moved to earn more from higher subscription fees from fewer readers.<ref name=""circulation_oct_09_02""></ref> In May 2013, Vega retired and was replaced as publisher by former ''Los Angeles Times'' publisher Jeffrey M. Johnson. SFGate, the main digital portal for the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', registered 19 million unique visitors in January 2015, making it the seventh ranked newspaper website in the United States.   ==Publishers== * [[M.

Founded in 1933, it flourished during the [[Great Depression  under the guidance of founders [[Arnold Gingrich , [[David A. Smart  and [[Henry L. Jackson .  ==History== ''Esquire'' was first issued in October 1933. The magazine was first headquartered in Chicago and then, in New York City.  It was founded and edited by [[David A. Smart , [[Henry L. Jackson  and [[Arnold Gingrich . Jackson died in the crash of [[United Airlines Flight 624  in 1948, while Gingrich led the magazine until his own death in 1976. Smart died in 1952, although he left ''Esquire'' in 1936 to found a different magazine, ''[[Coronet  magazine |Coronet ''. The founders all had different focuses; Gingrich specialized in publishing, Smart led the business side of the magazine while Jackson led and edited the fashion section, which made up most of the magazine in its first fifteen years of publishing. Additionally, Jackson's [[Republican Party  United States |Republican  political viewpoints contrasted with the [[liberalism in the United States|liberal  [[Democratic Party  United States |Democratic  views of Smart, which allowed for the magazine to publish debates between the two. This grew particularly heated in 1943 when the Democratic [[United States Postmaster General  [[Frank Comerford Walker  brought charges against the magazine on behalf of the administration of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt . The administration alleged that ''Esquire'' had used the [[US Postal Service  to promote ""lewd images"". Republicans opposed the lawsuit and in 1946 the [[United States Supreme Court  found in ''Esquire v. Walker'' that ''Esquire'' right to use the Postal Service was protected by the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution .  ''Esquire'' started in 1933 as a quarterly press run of a hundred thousand copies. It cost fifty cents per copy  equivalent to $ today . It later transformed itself into a more refined [[Periodical literature|periodical  with an emphasis on men's fashion and contributions by [[Ernest Hemingway , [[F. Scott Fitzgerald , [[Alberto Moravia , [[André Gide , and [[Julian Huxley . In the 1940s, the popularity of the [[George Petty|Petty Girls  and [[Alberto Vargas|Vargas Girls  provided a circulation boost. In the 1960s, ''Esquire'' helped pioneer the trend of [[New Journalism  by publishing such writers as [[Norman Mailer , [[Tim O'Brien  author |Tim O'Brien , [[John Sack , [[Gay Talese , [[Tom Wolfe , and [[Terry Southern .  In the mid 1960s, ''Esquire'' partnered with [[Verve Records  to release a series of ""Sound Tour"" vinyl LPs that provided advice and music for traveling abroad. In August 1969, ''Esquire'' published [[Normand Poirier 's piece, ""An American Atrocity"", one of the first reports of American atrocities committed against Vietnamese civilians.<ref name=""nytimes"">[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/04/obituaries/normand-poirier.html ""Normand Poirier""]. ''[[The New York Times ''. February 4, 1981</ref>  Under [[Harold Hayes , who ran it from 1961 to 1973, it became as distinctive as its oversized pages. The magazine shrank to the conventional [[Letter  paper size |8½×11  inches in 1971. The magazine was sold by the original owners to [[Clay Felker  in 1977, who reinvented the magazine as a [[fortnight ly in 1978, under the title of ''Esquire Fortnightly''. However, the fortnightly experiment proved to be a failure, and by the end of that year, the magazine lost [[United States dollar|US$ 5 million. Felker sold ''Esquire'' in 1979 to the 13-30 Corporation, a Tennessee publisher, whose owners refocused the magazine into a monthly. During this time, ''[[New York Woman '' magazine was launched as something of a spinoff version of ''Esquire'' aimed at female audience. 13-30 split up in 1986, and ''Esquire'' was sold to [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst  at the end of the year, with ''New York Woman'' going its separate way to American Express Publishing.  [[David M. Granger  was named [[editor-in-chief  of the magazine in June 1997. Since his arrival, the magazine has received numerous awards, including multiple National Magazine Awards. Prior to becoming [[editor-in-chief  at ''Esquire'', [[David M. Granger|Granger  was the executive editor at ''[[GQ  magazine |GQ '' for nearly six years. Its award-winning staff writers include [[Tom Chiarella , [[Scott Raab , [[Mike Sager , Chris Jones, John H. Richardson, [[Cal Fussman , [[Lisa Taddeo , and [[Tom Junod . Famous photographers have also worked for the magazine, among which fashion photographer [[Gleb Derujinsky , and [[Richard Avedon .  ==Blog== In January 2009 ''Esquire'' launched a new blog—the ''Daily Endorsement Blog''. Each morning the editors of the magazine recommend one thing for readers' immediate enjoyment: ""not a political candidate or position or party, but a breakthrough idea or product or Web site."" The concept of the ""Daily Endorsement Blog"" was said to have emerged from ''Esquire'' November 2008 issue called the ""Endorsement Issue"", in which, after 75 years, ''Esquire'' publicly endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time. The ''Daily Endorsement Blog'' was officially discontinued on April 2011.  ==Fiction== From 1969 to 1976, [[Gordon Lish  served as fiction editor for ''Esquire'' and became known as ""Captain Fiction"" because of the authors whose careers he assisted. Lish helped establish the career of writer [[Raymond Carver  by publishing his short stories in ''Esquire'', often over the objections of Hayes. Lish is noted for encouraging Carver's [[minimalism  and publishing the short stories of [[Richard Ford . Using the influential publication as a vehicle to introduce new fiction by emerging authors, he promoted the work of such writers as [[T. Coraghessan Boyle , [[Barry Hannah , [[Cynthia Ozick  and [[Reynolds Price .  In February 1977, ''Esquire'' published ""For Rupert – with no promises"" as an unsigned work of fiction: this was the first time it had published a work without identifying the author. Readers speculated that it was the work of [[J. D. Salinger , the reclusive author best known for ''[[The Catcher in the Rye ''. Told in first-person, the story features events and Glass family names from the story ""[[For Esmé – with Love and Squalor "". [[Gordon Lish  is quoted as saying, ""I tried to borrow Salinger's voice and the psychological circumstances of his life, as I imagine them to be now. And I tried to use those things to elaborate on certain circumstances and events in his fiction to deepen them and add complexity.""  Other authors appearing in ''Esquire'' at that time included [[William F. Buckley , [[Truman Capote , [[Murray Kempton , [[Malcolm Muggeridge , [[Ron Rosenbaum , [[Andrew Vachss  and [[Garry Wills .  The magazine's policy of nurturing young writing talent has continued with [[Elizabeth Gilbert , who debuted in ''Esquire'' in 1993, and more recently, with the work of such writers as [[Chris Adrian , [[Nathan Englander , [[Benjamin Percy , and [[Patrick Somerville . Other writers who have recently appeared in the magazine and on Esquire.com include [[Ralph Lombreglia , [[James Lee Burke , and [[Stephen King .  ==The Napkin Fiction Project== In 2007 ''Esquire'' launched the Napkin Fiction Project, in which 250 cocktail napkins were mailed to writers all over the country by the incoming fiction editor, in a playful attempt to revive short fiction—""some with a half dozen books to their name, others just finishing their first."" In return, the magazine received nearly a hundred stories. [[Rick Moody , [[Jonathan Ames , [[Bret Anthony Johnston , [[Joshua Ferris , [[Yiyun Li , [[Aimee Bender , and [[ZZ Packer  are among the notable writers included.  ==Dubious Achievement Awards== For many years, ''Esquire'' has published its annual ''Dubious Achievement Awards'', lampooning events of the preceding year. As a [[running gag , the annual article almost always displayed an old photo of [[Richard Nixon  laughing, with the caption, ""Why is this man laughing?"" However, the February 2006 ""Dubious Achievement Awards"" used the caption under a photo of [[W. Mark Felt , the former FBI official revealed in 2005 to be the ""[[Deep Throat  Watergate |Deep Throat "" [[Watergate scandal|Watergate  source for [[Bob Woodward  and [[Carl Bernstein . The magazine did continue the Nixon photo in February 2007, referring to a poll stating that [[George W. Bush  had surpassed Nixon as the ""worst president ever"". Another running gag has been headlining one especially egregious achievement, ""And then they went to [[Elaine's .""  [[Elaine's  was a popular restaurant in New York City. It closed May 2011.   ''Esquire'' did not publish ""Dubious Achievement Awards"" for 2001, but resumed them with the 2002 awards, published in the February 2003 issue.  ""Dubious Achievement Awards"" were discontinued in 2008, according to an editor's note in the January 2008 issue. However, after a nine-year hiatus, the feature was revived in the January 2017 issue with a skewering of 2016 events.  ==Sexiest Woman Alive==   The annual feature '''Sexiest Woman Alive''' designation by the magazine is billed as a benchmark of female attractiveness.  Originally, it was a part of the ""Women We Love"" issue that was released in November. To build interest, the magazine would do a tease, releasing partial images of the woman in the issues preceding the November issue. By 2007, it had become the dominating story of the issue and to create an element of surprise the hints were abandoned.  {|class=""wikitable sortable"" |- | Year | Choice | Age |- | 2004 |[[Angelina Jolie <ref name=""sexiest-2004""></ref> | 29 |- | 2005 |[[Jessica Biel <ref name=""sexiest-2005""></ref> | 23 |- | 2006 |[[Scarlett Johansson <ref name=""Jones""></ref> | 21 |- | 2007 |[[Charlize Theron  | 32 |- | 2008 |[[Halle Berry  | 42 |- | 2009 |[[Kate Beckinsale  | 36 |- | 2010 |[[Minka Kelly  | 30 |- | 2011 |[[Rihanna  | 23 |- | 2012 |[[Mila Kunis  | 29 |- | 2013 |[[Scarlett Johansson <ref name=""Jones""/> | 28 |- | 2014 |[[Penelope Cruz  |40 |- | 2015 |[[Emilia Clarke  |28 |}  ==Awards and honors == ===2000–present=== [[National Magazine Awards   ; 2011 * In March, ''Esquire'' won a National Magazine Award for Digital Media—the first Mobile Edition prize—from the American Society of Magazine Editors. ; 2009 * Winner for Personal Service, Feature Writing, and Leisure Interests * Finalist for Profile Writing ; 2008 * Finalist for Magazine Section ; 2007 * Winner for Reporting * Finalist for General Excellence  500,000 to 1,000,000 circulation , Magazine Section  two nominations , Feature Writing  two nominations , and Leisure Interests  ; 2006 * Winner for General Excellence  500,000 to 1,000,000 circulation  and Profile Writing ; 2005 * Winner for Feature Writing ; 2004 * Winner for Reviews & Criticism, Fiction, Design, and Profile Writing ; 2001 * Winner for Reporting  ; 2000 * Winner for Reviews & Criticism  ==International editions== * Bulgaria  since 2014   * China ''[[Shishang xiansheng ''  时尚先生   since 1999   * Colombia  2012 - 2017  * Czech Republic * Greece * Germany  1987-1992   * El Salvador  since 2009  * [https://www.esquirehk.com/ Hong Kong]  published by [[SCMP Group   * Indonesia  launched 2007, published by MRA Group  * [https://www.esquire.com/it/ Italy]  2018  * Japan  launched 1987, published by [[Culture Convenience Club|Esquire Magazine Japan Co., Ltd.   * Kazakhstan * Korea * Malaysia  launched April 2011  * Mexico * The Middle East  launched November 2009  * Netherlands,  * Philippines  launched October 2011, published by [[Summit Media   * Poland  * Republic of China  Taiwan  * Romania * Russia * Serbia  launched October 2013, published by Attica Media Serbia  * Singapore  launched September 2012  * South Korea  launched November 2007, published by Kaya Media  * Spain * Thailand * Turkey * Ukraine  launched in March 2012, closed in 2014  * [[Esquire  UK Edition |United Kingdom  * Vietnam  launched April 2013   ==See also== * [[List of men's magazines  * [[Men's Health UK  * [[Esquire Network  - A defunct television network based on the magazine * [[Allegra Coleman  * [[Meyer Levin  * [[Nat Mags   UK publisher  * [[Roberto Parada  painter |Roberto Parada  * [[Yulia Spiridonova   Russian photographer   ==References==   ==External links== *   US  * [https://www.esquire.com/uk/ Official website  UK ] * [https://www.esquirehk.com/ Official website  Hong Kong ] * [http://news.cnet.com/Esquire-wikis-article-on-Wikipedia/2100-1038_3-5885171.html C Net News article about the experiment of the ''Esquire'' writer in Wikipedia] *      [[Category:Magazines established in 1933  [[Category:American monthly magazines  [[Category:Hearst Communications publications  [[Category:American men's magazines  [[Category:Men's fashion magazines  [[Category:Esquire  magazine |*  [[Category:American lifestyle magazines  [[Category:American literary magazines  [[Category:American political magazines  [[Category:Magazines published in Chicago  [[Category:Magazines published in New York City ","Esquire is an American men's magazine, published by the Hearst Corporation in the United States.

Initially operating from a row house near [[Capitol Hill , the firm went from 13 employees in 2014 to 39 in Washington, D.C. in late 2015.  In 2015, the company published a report on the ‘Shy Trump’ voter in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|Republican presidential primaries . The claim has since be debunked by political scientists.  The company subsequently signed partnership agreements with a number of media outlets. In February 2016, Morning Consult partnered with [[Vox Media|Vox  to conduct polling on topical stories in politics and culture. In June 2016, Morning Consult debuted the Morning Consult Brand Index in [[Fortune  magazine |''Fortune''  magazine's annual release of the [[Fortune 500  list and began polling with [[Bloomberg News  on investor sentiment.[[File:Michael Ramlet.jpg|thumb|329x329px| Morning Consult CEO & Co-Founder Michael Ramlet at the company's headquarters. |left  During the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. Presidential election , Morning Consult and the political journalism company [[Politico  published a weekly polling partnership on ‘political issues, personalities and media aspects that affect the daily debate.'

In 2018, the company announced it was partnering with The Hollywood Reporter for a weekly polling series on what Americans think about the hottest news and trends in Hollywood. The company also launched two new editorial verticals looking at entertainment and sports.  == Polling and methodology == Morning Consult conducts scientific online polling. It uses a [[stratified sampling  process and multiple nationally recognized vendors to access to tens of millions of Americans. After fielding, Morning Consult applies weights based on age, race/ethnicity, gender, educational attainment, and region  determined by 2016 Current Population Survey .  During the 2016 presidential election, Morning Consult had one of the most accurate national polls: despite calling the winner of the election incorrectly, it successfully predicted [[Hillary Clinton  winning the national popular vote by 3 percent  she won by 2.1 percent .

Engineer Edward Craig Hyatt stated that it was not possible to use human hair in any configuration to generate electricity when exposed to light. *June 2010: ''[[The Guardian '' reported that MailOnline had published an inaccurate story about an [[iPhone 4  recall, based on a [[Twitter  message from a parody account by a [[Steve Jobs  impersonator. MailOnline realised its error and removed the article. *<!-- Please comment on talk page before modifying this paragraph - this phrasing has been carefully negotiated. -->In October 2011, ''MailOnline'' and several other news sources published standby articles on [[Amanda Knox 's trial prematurely. The articles reported an upholding of the guilty verdict before the judge had finished announcing the reversal of the guilty verdict. MailOnline stated the article was removed within 90 seconds and apologized. The article became the subject of a [[Press Complaints Commission  complaint that noted the article's reporting of events and reactions that had not taken place and said that was ""not acceptable"" but commented positively on the handling of the error. *January 2012: [[ABC News Radio  reported the falsity of a story ""repeated by numerous media outlets"" concerning a supposed naming by'' [[Advertising Age '' of a campaign by singer [[Rihanna  for fashion house [[Armani  as the ""sexiest ad of the year."" The story, ''Ad Age'' said, ""seemed to have originated with the British tabloid the ''Daily Mail.'' ''Huffington Post'' removed the story and apologized. *January 2012: Robert Hart-Fletcher, of the charity Kids and Media, told ''BeefJack'', a gaming magazine, that quotes attributed to him were ""completely fabricated"" across a range of British media, most prominently the ''Daily Mail'' and the BBC. *April 2012: MailOnline published an article about a dentist who extracted her ex-boyfriend's teeth; the piece was later exposed as a hoax by [[NBCNews.com|MSNBC.com . The article appeared under the byline of reporter Simon Tomlinson, who said he does not know where the story came from. *April 2012: ''[[The Christian Science Monitor '' reported that MailOnline had misused an [[op-ed|opinion piece  published in Egypt's ''[[Al-Ahram '' newspaper and translated into English by ''[[Al Arabiya ''. The original article claimed ""Egypt's parliament was considering a piece of legislation sponsored by Islamists to allow men to have sex with their wives after their death."" The ''Daily Mail'', according to ''Monitor'' staff writer Dan Murphy, ""distorted the original claim from a proposal to a done deal: 'Egyptian husbands will soon be legally allowed to have sex with their dead wives', the tabloid claimed, apparently having misunderstood the original ''Al Arabiya'' translation."" *October 2012: Actor [[Nicolas Cage  received an apology and damages for a false story in MailOnline about allegations of tax evasion. *July 2014: The MailOnline admitted having published an entirely false story about George Clooney and the family of his fiancée. * April 2016: [[Martin Fletcher  wrote in the ''[[New Statesman '' about travelling to Iraq and writing a piece for ''[[The Times '', then seeing his piece appear on ''MailOnline'' under someone else's [[byline  ""within five hours"". * February 2017: Wikipedia bans ''MailOnline'' citations as unreliable content.<ref name=""independent.co.uk""/> * April 2017: ''[[The Sun  United Kingdom |The Sun '' threatened MailOnline with legal action over copyright infringement regarding a ''Sun'' exclusive video.

The article said that when the MailOnline is called out for stealing content, it will sometime removes the text in question without acknowledging or apologising for the problem.<ref name=""poynter""/>  Martin Clarke, editor of MailOnline, said, ""We will soon be introducing features that will allow us to link easily and prominently to other sites when further recognition of source material is needed.""<ref name=""poynter""></ref> However, by July 2013, MailOnline articles, including main articles, still did not contain any links to original sources or tips.  In 2015, James King, who left the MailOnline after a year as a reporter, said that the editorial model of the Mail depended on ""dishonesty, theft of copyrighted material, and sensationalism so absurd that it crosses into fabrication"".  King worked as a contractor, and declined a full-time job because he did not want to put his byline on his stories.  Daily Mail Australia has been repeatedly and widely criticised by rival Australian news outlets, including [[Fairfax Media , [[News Corp Australia , [[ABC News  Australia |ABC News , [[Nine Network , ''[[The New Zealand Herald '' and ''[[The Guardian Australia '',<ref name=""mediawatch""></ref> for continuously plagarising the work of their journalists despite employing 90 editorial staff as of November 2018.<ref name=""guardAU""></ref> It has been reported that Daily Mail staff are expected to generate at least 5 stories daily each, doing so by copying large parts of other's work.<ref name=""guardAU""/> The Daily Mail claims that other news outlets are threatened by their growing popularity and that they attribute their sources. In November 2018, [[Content analysis|media analysis  television show ''[[Media Watch  TV program |Media Watch '' dedicated an entire program to highlighting examples of Daily Mail theft.<ref name=""mediawatch""/>  ==Awards==  In March 2014, MailOnline Sports was named Laureus Sports Website of the Year at the 2014 Sports Journalist Association awards.

Headquartered in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota , PRI runs over 850 public radio stations in the United States.  PRI is one of the main providers of programming for public radio stations in the US, alongside [[National Public Radio , [[American Public Media  and the [[Public Radio Exchange .  ==Background== In the United States, PRI exclusively distributes well-known programming to public radio stations. Among its programs is the global news program ''[[The World  radio program |The World '', which PRI co-produces with the [[BBC  and [[WGBH  FM |WGBH  [[Boston . Programs on PRI—sometimes mis-attributed to [[National Public Radio —are produced by a variety of organizations, including PRI in the United States and other countries.<ref name=""PRIFactSheet""></ref> PRI, along with [[NPR  and [[American Public Media , is one of the largest program producers and distributors of public radio programming in the United States. PRI offers over 280 hours of programming each week to stations and listeners.<ref name=""PRIFactSheet"" /> According to their website, the mission of Public Radio International is to ""serve audiences as a distinctive content source for information, insights and cultural experiences essential to living in our diverse, interconnected world.""

The corporation changed its name to Public Radio International in 1994 to reflect its growing interest and involvement in international audio publishing, as typified by its many collaborations with the [[BBC .  In the mid-1990s, PRI began to expand its reach by producing programming in addition to distributing programming. This evolution in the company began with PRI's ''[[The World  radio program |The World '', a co-production among PRI, the [[BBC World Service , and WGBH. This daily global news program was one of the first news-oriented co-productions of the [[BBC World Service  anywhere.  In 2004, Minnesota Public Radio left PRI and began distributing its own shows  including ''[[A Prairie Home Companion '' and ''[[Marketplace  radio program |Marketplace '' and excluding ''Classical 24''  through [[American Public Media . In 2012, PRI was acquired by the [[WGBH Educational Foundation .  ==Recent program launches and firsts== In 1995: PRI launches ''[[Classical 24 '', public radio’s first 24-hour classical music service, as a co-production with Minnesota Public Radio.  In 1996: PRI’s ''[[The World  radio program |The World '' premieres'','' presenting issues and events ""through a global lens"" to American audiences. Co-produced by PRI with BBC World Service and WGBH Radio Boston, it was the first daily news co-production ever undertaken by the BBC.

In January 2008, PRI and WNYC announced that the name of their new morning drive news program is ''[[The Takeaway '' with [[John Hockenberry  and [[Adaora Udoji . This program's editorial partners include The BBC World Service, ''The New York Times'', and WGBH Radio Boston. The program successfully launched April 28, and full national launch is expected June/July 2008.  On May 1, 2008, PRI was the first major public media outlet to use [[digital cinema ; and one of the first mass media companies overall. PRI conceived and spearheaded ''This American Life Live!'' in partnership with Ira Glass and WBEZ Chicago. ''This American Life Live!'' was presented exclusively in select theatres by National CineMedia's  NCM  Fathom, in partnership with BY Experience and Chicago Public Radio, and in association with Public Radio International.   In 2012: PRI is acquired by WGBH.   On March 21, 2014, the company announced the agreement to distribute ''This American Life'' would end July 1, 2014.  In 2017: PRI launches its Engagement Lab  ==Public radio, PRI, NPR== [[Public radio  is a generic term for non-commercial radio stations or programming that are covered under the Public Broadcasting Act. Public radio organizations receive funding from corporate sponsors, public  e.g., [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting   and private foundation grants as well as donations and gifts from individuals. The mix of revenue differs by station, network and/or producer. PRI, NPR and American Public Media are the largest providers of public radio programming in the United States. They compete with each other for slots on public radio stations and the attention of listeners. Each has distinct missions and emphases in programming—PRI is focused on global journalism, providing diverse voices, and arts and cultural perspectives. Any given public radio station may be simultaneously both an NPR member and an affiliate of PRI and APM. PRI is a not-for-profit organization that has an independent governing board with an independent board of directors. NPR is a membership organization; its board is composed of public radio stations which run for seats on the board.  PRI is a younger organization than NPR, and focuses on pushing the sound of public radio forward through innovative programming strategies and leading media in its areas of focus—global news and cultural perspectives.  NPR was founded in 1970 and PRI in 1983.  Many PRI shows draw a younger overall audience than shows produced by NPR. PRI's stated purpose is to offer a wider range of voices than NPR programs.  In recent years, there have been changes among distributors of numerous programs. Some programs that were formerly distributed by PRI, such as ''[[A Prairie Home Companion '', ''[[Marketplace  radio program |Marketplace '', and ''[[American Routes '', along with the [[BBC World Service , are now distributed by [[American Public Media . APM was formed by Minnesota Public Radio to distribute programs it owned and produced, thereby moving distribution from PRI to APM.  In addition, PRI distributed ''[[World Cafe '' for many years, but in 2005, the show's distribution was switched to NPR. At the same time, PRI has also picked up the distribution of programs originally distributed by [[NPR , including ''[[Michael Feldman's Whad'Ya Know? '', and, in 2006, ''[[Living on Earth ''—[[public radio 's leading news and information program focused on the environment. In September 2007, PRI became the national distributor of ''[[Selected Shorts '' which was previously distributed by NPR. In January 2014, PRI became the national distributor of ''[[Science Friday '', also previously distributed by NPR.  ==See also== * [[American Public Media  * [[National Public Radio  * [[Public Broadcasting Service  * [[List of United States radio networks  * [[The Corporation for Public Broadcasting   ==References==        [[Category:Public Radio International  [[Category:Corporation for Public Broadcasting  [[Category:Sirius Satellite Radio channels  [[Category:Peabody Award winners  [[Category:Podcasting companies  [[Category:This American Life  [[Category:Radio stations established in 1983  [[Category:1983 establishments in the United States  [[Category:American journalism organizations ","Public Radio International  PRI  is an American public radio organization.

It is owned by the [[Gannett|Gannett Company, Inc.   ''The Journal News'' was created through a [[merger  of several daily community newspapers serving the three counties. Although the current newspaper's name comes from the ''Rockland Journal-News'', which was based in West Nyack, N.Y., and served Rockland County, the ''Rockland Journal-News'' was actually the third-largest newspaper that Gannett merged to create the larger newspaper. ''The Reporter Dispatch'' from White Plains, N.Y., and the ''Herald Statesman'' in Yonkers, N.Y. were larger and served Westchester County.  For years prior to the October 12, 1998, merger that created ''The Journal News'', ten of the newspapers shared substantial content and printing presses.  Gannett acquired nine of the newspapers in 1964 from the Macy family and added ''The Star'' in Peekskill, N.Y., in 1985.<ref name=""Gannett profile""></ref> These newspapers previously appeared on newsstands in the evening. In 1989, Gannett created a morning edition for Putnam County, Westchester, and the Bronx called ''The Sunrise'', but it folded after a year. Today, ''The Journal News'' appears in the morning like other New York dailies.  ==History== Newspapers that merged in 1998 to create ''The Journal News'': *''The Daily Times''  [[Mamaroneck  village , New York|Mamaroneck   *''The Daily Argus''  [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon   *''The Standard-Star''  [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle   *''The Citizen Register''  [[Ossining  village , New York|Ossining   *''The Star''  [[Peekskill, New York|Peekskill   *''The Daily Item''  [[Port Chester, New York|Port Chester   *''The Daily News''  [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown   *''Rockland Journal-News''  [[West Nyack   *''The Reporter Dispatch''  [[White Plains, New York|White Plains   *''The Herald Statesman''  [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers   **''The Patent Trader''  [[Mount Kisco, New York|Mount Kisco    itself the product of a 1956 merger of Northern Westchester papers  was subsequently acquired by Gannett and folded in 2007.  In 2005, ''The Journal News'' expanded its Custom Publishing division and began publishing a series of suburban lifestyle magazines about the Lower Hudson Valley region. The first of these publications was ''[[InTown '', which covered the Westchester market with hyper-local editions targeting different regions of the county: *White Plains *Scarsdale *Northern Westchester  Chappaqua, Mount Kisco, Bedford, Katonah  *Larchmont/Mamaroneck *Bronxville/Tuckahoe/Eastchester  *Rye/Harrison/Purchase *River Towns  Hastings, Dobbs Ferry, Irvington, Tarrytown   In late 2006, these numerous editions were all consolidated into one county-wide publication, ''InTown Westchester'', which publishes 10 times a year. ''The Journal News'' also successfully launched ''Rockland Magazine'' and ''[[Putnam Magazine '' in 2005, and ''[[Scarsdale Magazine ''  originally InTown Scarsdale  in early 2006.  ''The Journal News'' also publishes five ultra-local community weekly ""Express"" newspapers serving Northern Westchester, Putnam, Yorktown/Cortlandt, Sound Shore and White Plains as well as the Review Press, a weekly newspaper covering Eastchester, Bronxville and Tuckahoe.  ''The Journal News''' web site, LoHud.com, features daily news updates, more than 40 blogs as well as Varsity Insider, an online source for varsity sports, featuring rosters, schedules and statistic for high school teams throughout the region.  On March 7, 2010 ''The Journal News'' closed its press and outsourced printing.  == Pistol permit map controversy == On December 22, 2012 ''The Journal News'' published an interactive map showing the names, addresses and home locations of all pistol permit holders licensed in Westchester and Rockland counties, New York.<ref name=journalnews-burglar-target></ref>  The following day, blogger Christopher Fountain published the names and addresses of the staffers of ''The Journal News''.<ref name=""nrt""></ref> The newspaper and some of its staff responded by hiring armed security, a move that critics called hypocritical considering the paper's anti-gun stance.  Rockland County law enforcement officers condemned the map, saying that it endangered lives, including those of corrections officers. Several newspapers also published reports of victims of domestic violence, rape, or other violent crimes who reported that their attackers now had possession of their addresses as their names were published online.  Newsday has reported that police are investigating if the Journal News pistol permit map played a role in a burglary in White Plains, New York.  According to police, at least two burglars broke into a home on January 12, 2013 but were unsuccessful in an attempt to open a gun safe, which contained legally owned weapons.  Police are investigating what role, if any, the Journal News database played in the burglars' decision to target the home.<ref name=""journalnews-burglar-target"" /><!-- what was the result of the police investigation?, if any? -->  The Daily Mail has reported that a burglary has occurred in a similarly mapped home in New City, New York, on January 16, 2013.

On February 23, 2017, ClickHole temporarily changed its name to Cruft. The change was unexplained, and the name was changed back the following day.  On May 17, 2017, ClickHole was changed to PatriotHole, declaring itself to be ""the only viral media site brave enough to SCREAM about REAL Americans"" and ""the internet’s last stand against the tyranny of the Leftist Media."" As PatriotHole, the site's journalistic style shifted to resemble conservative news websites such as [[Breitbart News|Breitbart  and [[InfoWars . The site's logo was changed from an orange spiral pattern to a white eagle with orange lines spanning between its wings. Two days later, the site changed back to normal, although PatriotHole was spun off into its own section.

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center  labels WorldNetDaily as an antigovernment extremist group.  ===Clark Jones libel lawsuit  2000–2008 === On September 20, 2000, ''WND'' published an article saying that Clark Jones, a [[Savannah, Tennessee  car dealer, a fund-raiser for then-Vice President [[Al Gore  in his presidential campaign, had interfered with a criminal investigation, had been a ""subject"" of a criminal investigation, and was listed on law enforcement computers as a ""dope dealer."" It implied that he had ties to others involved in alleged criminal activity. The authors later put forward the theory that the publication of this article, as well as other ''WND'' articles that were critical of Gore, contributed significantly to Gore losing his home state of Tennessee that November.  In 2001, Clark Jones filed a [[lawsuit  against ''WND''; the reporters, Charles C. Thompson II and Tony Hays; the [[Center for Public Integrity , which had underwritten Thompson and Hays' reporting on the article and related ones; and various Tennessee publications and broadcasters whom he accused of repeating the claim, arguing these entities had committed libel and [[defamation . The lawsuit was scheduled to go to trial in March 2008; but, on February 13, 2008, ''WND'' announced that a confidential out-of-court settlement had been reached with Jones.<ref name=""JonesLibelSettlement""></ref> A settlement statement jointly drafted by all parties in the lawsuit stated that a [[Freedom of Information Act  United States |Freedom of Information Act  request showed that the allegations had been false, and that ''WND'' had misquoted sources.<ref name=""JonesLibelSettlement"" />  ===Anthony C. LoBaido commentary on September 11 attacks  2001 === On September 13, 2001, ''WND'' published an opinion article by Anthony C. LoBaido regarding the [[September 11 attacks  on New York City and Washington, D.C., that had occurred two days earlier. In his column, LoBaido described what he said was the moral depravity of America in general and New York in particular, asking whether ""God  has  raised up [[Shiite Islam  as a sword against America"". Commentators [[Virginia Postrel  of ''[[Reason  magazine |Reason '' magazine and [[James Taranto  of the ''[[Wall Street Journal '' criticized LoBaido and Joseph Farah for the piece and called for columnists [[Hugh Hewitt  and [[Bill O'Reilly  commentator |Bill O'Reilly  to sever their ties with ''WND.'' Founder Farah responded with his own column, saying that LoBaido's opinion piece did not reflect the viewpoint of ''WND'', and that it, like most other commentary pieces, had not been reviewed before publication.  ===Application for congressional press credentials  2002 === Seeking credentials to cover the [[U.S. Congress  in 2002, ''WND'' was opposed by the [[Press gallery|Standing Committee of Correspondents . This panel of journalists is charged by Congress with administering press credentials. Until 1996, Internet-only publications had been deemed unacceptable. ''WND'' turned to the [[United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration  for help, arguing that the panel's decision had violated the site's constitutional rights to due process, equal protection, and freedom of the press. Faced ""with legal threats and negative publicity, the panel reversed itself, voting 3–2 to award ''WND'' its credentials"". Shortly after, the rules were formally adjusted to clarify the participation of online publications.  ===Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories  2008–2011 === [[File:Billboard Challenging the validity of Barack Obama's Birth Certificate.JPG|thumb|A 2010 billboard displayed in [[South Gate, California , questioning the [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|validity of Barack Obama's birth certificate  and by extension [[#Rejection by conspiracy theorists|his citizenship and eligibility to serve as President of the U.S. <ref name=politico2009-07-28>Birthers' claim Gibbs lied when he said Obama's birth certificate is posted on the Internet|accessdate=March 8, 2012 </ref> The billboard was part of an [[advertising campaign  by ''WorldNetDaily'', whose [[URL  appears on the billboard's bottom right corner.

After the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential campaign , ''WND'' began an online petition to have Obama's Hawaiian birth certificate released to the public. The website also unsuccessfully urged [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court  justices to hear several lawsuits aiming to release Obama's birth certificate. The White House released copies of the president's original long-form birth certificate on April 27, 2011. After the long-form birth certificate was released, ''WND'' continued to promote its conspiracy theory, publishing an article questioning the certificate's authenticity.  ===Ann Coulter speech at Homocon  2010 === In 2010, when [[Ann Coulter  accepted an invitation to attend and speak at [[GOProud 's Homocon 2010 convention, Farah announced the withdrawal of Coulter's name from the list of speakers at the company's 'Taking America Back' conference. Coulter responded by saying that speaking engagements do not imply endorsement of the hosting organization. After Farah published private emails between him and Coulter, Coulter criticized Farah in an email to ''[[The Daily Caller ''. WND still publishes Coulter's weekly syndicated column.  ===Southern Poverty Law Center accusation of ''WND'' ""peddling white nationalism""  2012 === [[The Southern Poverty Law Center  has accused ''WND'' of ""peddling white nationalism,"" due to its publication of a series of articles on ""black mob violence"" by writer Colin Flaherty.

The website accused Harris of ""mocking Christianity."" Quarterback [[Tim Tebow  was known for inscribing [[Bible  verses with eye black to wear during [[NFL  games. But, a similar advertisement by [[Beyoncé  for the Super Bowl had not been criticized. In a later [[Twitter  post by Harris about the Super Bowl, he used the [[hashtag  ""#noagenda"".  ===Russian interference in US politics=== August 7, 2017, WorldNetDaily published ""The 8 Dirtiest Scandals of Robert Mueller No One Is Talking About"" which was pushed-out by [[Elena Khusyaynova 's operation, targeting the [[Special Counsel investigation  2017–present |Mueller investigation .  ==''WND'' products== ''WND'' publishes books under the imprint ''WND Books''.

Founded in 1837, the newspaper is owned by [[Tribune Publishing .  ==History== ''The Sun'' was founded on May 17, 1837, by printer/editor/publisher/owner [[Arunah Shepherdson Abell   often listed as ""A.S. Abell""  and two associates, [[William Moseley Swain , and Azariah H. Simmons, recently from [[Philadelphia , where they had started and published the ''[[Public Ledger  Philadelphia |Public Ledger '' the year before. Abell was born in [[Rhode Island , where he began journalism with the ''Providence Patriot'' and later worked with [[Media in New York City|Newspapers in New York City  and [[List of newspapers in Massachusetts|Boston .<ref name=""doren"">Van Doren, Charles and Robert McKendry, ed., ''Webster's American Biographies''.  Springfield, Massachusetts: Merriam-Webster, 1984  p. 5</ref>  The Abell family and descendents owned ''The Sun''  later after 1910 colloquially known in Baltimore as ''The Sunpapers''  for the senior morning paper and the added afternoon daily ''The Evening Sun''  until that same year of 1910, when the local Black and Garrett families of wealthy financial means invested funds in the paper under the suggestion of former rival owner/publisher of [[Baltimore News-American|''The News'' , [[Charles H. Grasty , and they, along with Grasty gained a [[controlling interest ; they retained  the name A. S. Abell Company for the parent publishing company. That same year, an additional daily publication was established called ''The Evening Sun'' under the guidance of former reporter, editor/columnist [[H.L. Mencken|Henry Louis Mencken  nationally famous as ""H.L. Mencken""    1880-1956 , From 1947 to 1986, ''The Sun'' was the owner of Maryland's first [[television  station, [[WMAR-TV   Channel 2 , founded 1947 and longtime affiliate of the [[Columbia Broadcasting System   [[CBS  television network, along with several radio stations.  In the postwar years, ''The Sun'' significantly expanded its overseas presence. The newspaper opened its first foreign bureau in [[London  in 1924. Between 1955 and 1961, it added four new foreign offices. As [[Cold War  tensions grew, it set up shop in [[Bonn, Germany|Bonn, West Germany , in February 1955.  The bureau later moved to [[Berlin .  Eleven months later, ''The Sun'' opened a [[Moscow  bureau, becoming one of the first U.S. newspapers to do so. A [[Rome  office followed in July 1957, and in 1961, The Sun expanded to [[New Delhi . At its height, ''The Sun''' ran eight foreign bureaus, giving rise to its boast in a 1983 advertisement that ""The Sun never sets on the world.""<ref name=""auto""></ref>  The paper was sold under recent non-family publisher [[Reg Murphy  in 1986 to the [[Times-Mirror Company  of the ''[[Los Angeles Times .'' The same week, the 115 year old rivalry with ''[[Baltimore News American|The News American ,'' came to an end, as that ancient old paper with publishing antecedents since 1773, with subsequent mergers, announced that it would fold. The oldest paper in the city, it had been owned by [[William Randolph Hearst  and later his [[Hearst Corporation  since the 1920s. A decade later in 1997, ''The Sun'' acquired the [[The Howard County Times|Patuxent Publishing Company , a local suburban newspaper publisher that had a stable of 15 weekly papers and a few magazines in several communities and counties.  In the 1990s and 2000s, ''The Sun'' began cutting back its foreign coverage. In 1995 and 1996, closed its [[Tokyo , [[Mexico City  and [[Berlin  bureaus. Two more — [[Beijing  and [[London  — fell victim to cost-cutting in 2005.<ref name=""auto""/> The final three bureaus — Moscow, Jerusalem, and Johannesburg, South Africa — fell a couple years later. All were closed by 2008, as the Tribune Co. streamlined and downsized the newspaper chain's foreign reporting. Some material from ''The Sun's'' foreign correspondents is archived at the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County .  In the 21st century, ''The Sun'', like most legacy newspapers in the [[United States , has suffered a number of setbacks in the competition with Internet and other sources, including a decline in readership and ads, a shrinking newsroom staff, and competition in 2005 from a new free daily, ''[[The Baltimore Examiner '' that lasted two years to 2007, along with a similar Washington publication of a small chain recently started by new owners that took over the old Hearst flagship paper, the ''[[San Francisco Examiner ''. In 2000, the Times-Mirror company was purchased by the [[Tribune Company  of Chicago. I, 2014 it transferred its newspapers, including ''The Sun,'' to [[Tribune Publishing .  On September 19, 2005, and again on August 24, 2008, ''The Baltimore Sun'' as the paper now titled itself, introduced new layout designs. Its circulation  was 195,561 for the daily edition and 343,552 on Sundays. On April 29, 2009, the [[Tribune Company  announced that it would lay off 61 of the 205 staff members in the ''Sun'' newsroom.<ref name=9.6%>Mirabella, Lorraine; [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-04-26/business/bs-bz-sun-circulation-20100426_1_average-daily-circulation-baltimore-sun-media-group-previous-six-month-period""] ''The Baltimore Sun'', April 28, 2009 </ref> On September 23, 2011, it was reported that the ''Baltimore Sun'' would be moving its web edition behind a [[paywall  starting October 10, 2011.  ''The Baltimore Sun'' is the flagship of the Baltimore Sun Media Group, which also produces the ''b'' free daily newspaper and more than 30 other Baltimore metropolitan-area community newspapers, magazines and Web sites. BSMG content reaches more than one&nbsp;million Baltimore-area readers each week and is the region's most widely read source of news.  On February 20, 2014, The Baltimore Sun Media Group announced that they would buy the alternative weekly [[Baltimore City Paper|''City Paper'' . In April, the Sun acquired the Maryland publications of [[Landmark Media Enterprises .  ==Editions== Although there is now only a morning edition, for many years there were two distinct newspapers—''The Sun'' in the morning and ''The Evening Sun'' in the afternoon— each with its own separate reporting and editorial staff. ''The Evening Sun'' was first published in 1910 under the leadership of [[Charles H. Grasty , former owner of the ''Evening News'', and a firm believer in the evening circulation. For most of its existence, ''The Evening Sun'' led its morning sibling in circulation. In 1959, the afternoon edition's circulation was 220,174, compared to 196,675 for the morning edition.<ref name=""auto1""></ref> However, by the 1980s, cultural, technological and economic shifts in America were eating away at afternoon newspapers' market share, with readers flocking to either morning papers or switching to nightly television news broadcasts. In 1992, the afternoon paper's circulation was 133,800. By mid-1995, ''The Evening Sun's'' readership — 86,360 — had been eclipsed by ''The Sun'' — 264,583.<ref name=""auto1""/> ''The Evening Sun'' ceased publication on September 15, 1995.  ===Daily=== After a period of roughly a year during which the paper's owners sometimes printed a two-section product, ''The Baltimore Sun'' now has three sections every weekday: News, Sports and alternating various business and features sections. On some days, comics and such features as the horoscope and TV listings are printed in the back of the Sports section. After dropping the standalone business section in 2009, ''The Sun'' brought back a business section on Tuesdays and Sundays in 2010, with business pages occupying part of the news section on other days. Features sections debuting in 2010 included a Saturday ""Home"" section, a Thursday ""Style"" section and a Monday section called ""Sunrise."" The sports article written by [[Peter Schmuck  is published only on week-days.  ===Sunday=== The ''Sunday Sun'' for many years was noted for a locally produced [[rotogravure  Maryland pictorial magazine section, featuring works by such acclaimed photographers as [[A. Aubrey Bodine . The ''Sunday Sun'' dropped the Sunday ''Sun Magazine'' in 1996 and now only carries ''[[Parade  magazine |Parade '' magazine on a weekly basis. A quarterly version of the ''Sun Magazine'' was resurrected in September 2010, with stories that included a comparison of young local doctors, an interview with actress Julie Bowen and a feature on the homes of a former Baltimore anchorwoman. Newsroom managers plan to add online content on a more frequent basis.  ===baltimoresun.com=== The company introduced its Web site in September 1996. A redesign of the site was unveiled in June 2009, capping a six-month period of record online traffic. Each month from January through June, an average of 3.5 million unique visitors combined to view 36.6 million Web pages. ''Sun'' reporters and editors produce more than three dozen blogs on such subjects as technology, weather, education, politics, Baltimore crime, real estate, gardening, pets and parenting. Among the most popular are Dining@Large, which covers local restaurants; The Schmuck Stops Here, a Baltimore-centric sports blog written by Peter Schmuck; Z on TV, by media critic [[David Zurawik ; and Midnight Sun, a nightlife blog. A ''Baltimore Sun'' iPhone app was released September 14, 2010.  In 2018, in response to the European cookie law, baltimoresun.com began blocking visitors with European IP addresses rather than go to the effort of obtaining permission-requesting software, with the result that many European visitors  and those from some non-European countries  must visit the site via proxies, potentially screwing up the website's analytics.  ===''b''=== In 2008, the Baltimore Sun Media Group launched the daily paper ''b''  to target younger and more casual readers, ages 18 to 35. It was in [[Tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid  format, with large graphics, creative design, and humor in focusing on entertainment, news, and sports. Its companion website was bthesite.com. The paper transitioned from daily to weekly publication in 2011. It ceased publication entirely in August 2015, more than a year after the Baltimore Sun Media Group acquired ''City Paper.''  ==Contributors== ''The Baltimore Sun'' has been home to some of the best American writers, including reporter, essayist, and language scholar [[H.L. Mencken , who enjoyed a forty-plus-year association with the paper.

The paper has won 15&nbsp;[[Pulitzer Prize s.  ==Facilities== [[Image:1baltimore sun north.jpg|thumb|right|The Baltimore Sun, North Calvert Street  [[Image:1baltimore sun south.jpg|thumb|right|Sun Park in Port Covington  The first issue of ''The Sun'', a four-page tabloid, was printed at 21&nbsp;[[Light Street  Baltimore |Light Street  in downtown Baltimore in the mid-1830s. A five-story structure, at the corner of Baltimore and South streets, was built in 1851. The ""Iron Building"", as it was called, was destroyed in the [[Great Baltimore Fire  of 1904.  In 1906, operations were moved to [[Maryland Route 139|Charles  and [[Baltimore Street|Baltimore  streets, where ''The Sun'' was written, published and distributed for nearly 50&nbsp;years. In 1950, the operation was moved to a larger, modern plant at [[Calvert Street  Baltimore |Calvert  and [[Centre Street  Baltimore |Centre  streets. In 1979, ground was broken for a new addition to the Calvert Street plant to house modern pressroom facilities. The new facility commenced operations in 1981.  In April 1988, at a cost of $180&nbsp;million, the company purchased  of land at [[Port Covington  and built ""Sun Park"". The new building houses a satellite printing and packaging facility, as well as the distribution operation. ''The Sun''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s printing facility at Sun Park has highly sophisticated computerized presses and automated insertion equipment in the packaging area. To keep pace with the speed of the presses and Automated Guided Vehicles; ""intelligent"" electronic forklifts deliver the newsprint to the presses.  In 1885, ''The Sun'' constructed a [[Sun Building|building for its Washington Bureau  at 1317 F Street, NW.  The building is on the [[National Register of Historic Places|National Register .  ==Controversies== * The paper became embroiled in a controversy involving the former [[governor of Maryland , [[Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.   R . Ehrlich had issued an executive order on November 18, 2004, banning state executive branch employees from talking to ''Sun'' columnist [[Michael Olesker  and reporter [[David Nitkin , claiming that their coverage had been unfair to the administration. This led ''The Sun'' to file a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment  lawsuit against the Ehrlich administration. The case was dismissed by a [[U.S. District Court  judge, and ''The Sun'' appealed to the [[4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , which upheld the dismissal. * The same Olesker was forced to resign on January 4, 2006, after being accused of [[plagiarism .  The ''[[Baltimore City Paper '' reported that several of his columns contained sentences or paragraphs that were extremely similar  although not identical  to material previously published in ''[[The Washington Post '', ''[[The New York Times '', and ''The Sun''.  Several of his colleagues both in and out of the paper were highly critical of the forced resignation, taking the view that the use of previously published [[boilerplate  text |boilerplate  material was common [[newsroom  practice, and Olesker's alleged plagiarism was in line with that practice. * Between 2006 and 2007, [[Thomas Andrews Drake , a former [[National Security Agency  executive, allegedly leaked classified information to Siobhan Gorman, then a national security reporter for ''The Sun''. Drake was charged in April 2010 with 10 felony counts in relation to the leaks. In June 2011, all 10 original charges were dropped, in what was widely viewed as an acknowledgement that the government had no valid case against the whistleblower, who eventually pleaded to one misdemeanor count for exceeding authorized use of a computer. Drake was the 2011 recipient of the [[The Ridenhour Prizes|Ridenhour Prize for Truth-Telling .  ==In popular culture== ''The Baltimore Sun'' is featured in [[The Wire  season 5 |season 5  of ''[[The Wire '', which was created by former ''Sun'' reporter [[David Simon .  Like all of the institutions featured in ''The Wire'', the ''Sun'' is portrayed as having many deeply dysfunctional qualities while also having very dedicated people on its staff. The season focuses on the role of the media in affecting political decisions in [[City Hall  Baltimore |City Hall  and the priorities of the [[Baltimore Police Department . Additionally, the show explores the business pressures of modern media through layoffs and buyouts occurring at the ''Sun'', on the orders of the [[Tribune Company , the corporate owner of the ''Sun''.  One storyline involves a troubled ''Sun'' reporter named [[Scott Templeton  with an escalating tendency of sensationalizing and falsifying stories. ''The Wire'' portrays the managing editors of the ''Sun'' as turning a blind eye to the protests of a concerned line editor in the search for a [[Pulitzer Prize . The show insinuates that the motivation for this institutional dysfunction is the business pressures of modern media, and working for a flagship newspaper in a major media market like ''[[The New York Times '' or ''[[The Washington Post '' is seen as the only way to avoid the cutbacks occurring at the ''Sun''.  [[The Wire  season 5 |Season 5  was ''The Wire''s last. The last episode, ""[[-30-  The Wire episode |-30- "", features a montage at the end portraying the ultimate fate of the major characters. It shows Templeton at Columbia University with the senior editors of the fictional ''Sun'' accepting the Pulitzer Prize, with no mention being made as to the aftermath of Templeton's career.  ==News partnership== In September 2008, ''The Baltimore Sun'' became the newspaper partner of station [[WJZ-TV , owned and operated by [[CBS ; the partnership involves sharing content and story leads, and teaming up on stories. WJZ promotes ''Baltimore Sun'' stories in its news broadcasts. ''The Sun'' promotes WJZ's stories and weather team on its pages.  ==See also==  * [[:Category:The Baltimore Sun people|''The Baltimore Sun'' people  * [[List of newspapers in Maryland  * [[List of newspapers in the United States by circulation  * [[Media in Baltimore   ==References==   ==Further reading== *  *  * Merrill, John C. and Harold A.

Wilson had been a partner with [[John Williamson  New Zealand politician |John Williamson  in the ''New Zealander'', but left to start a rival daily newspaper as he saw a business opportunity with Auckland's rapidly growing population. He had also split with Williamson because Wilson supported the [[invasion of Waikato|war against the Māori   which the ''Herald'' termed ""the native rebellion""  while Williamson opposed it.<ref name=PP_NZH/> The ''Herald'' also promoted a more constructive relationship between the North and South Islands.<ref name=PP_NZH></ref>  After the ''New Zealander'' closed in 1866 ''The Daily Southern Cross'' provided competition, particularly after [[Julius Vogel  took a majority shareholding in 1868. ''The Daily Southern Cross'' was first published in 1843 by [[William Brown  New Zealand politician |William Brown  as ''The Southern Cross'' and had been a daily since 1862. Vogel sold out of the paper in 1873 and [[Alfred George Horton|Alfred Horton  bought it in 1876.<ref name=""Southern Cross history""></ref>  In 1876 the Wilson family and Horton joined in partnership and ''The New Zealand Herald'' absorbed ''The Daily Southern Cross''.<ref name=""Southern Cross history""/>  In 1879 the United Press Association was formed so that the main daily papers could share news stories.

The Wilson and Horton families were both represented in the company, known as Wilson & Horton, until 1996 when [[Tony O'Reilly 's [[Independent News & Media|Independent News & Media Group  of [[Dublin  purchased the Horton family's interest in the company. ''The Herald'' is now owned by [[New Zealand Media and Entertainment . That company is owned by [[Sydney -based [[APN News & Media  and the Radio Network, owned by the [[Australian Radio Network .  === Notable contributors === * Dita de Boni was a columnist for the newspaper, writing her first columns for the NZ Herald in 1995. From 2012 - 2015 she wrote a business and politics column until – after a series of articles increasingly critical of the Key government – the Herald discontinued her column for financial reasons.  *[[Gordon Minhinnick  was a staff cartoonist from the 1930s until his retirement in the 1980s.  *[[Malcolm Evans  cartoonist |Malcolm Evans  was fired from his position as staff cartoonist in 2003 after the newspaper received complaints about his cartoons on the conflict between Israel and Palestine. *[[Laurence Clark  cartoonist |Laurence Clark  was the daily political cartoonist from 1987 to 1996, and continued to publish cartoons weekly in the ''Herald'' until 2000.  === Format === On 10 September 2012, the Herald moved to a [[Compact  newspaper |compact  format for weekday editions, after 150 years publishing in [[broadsheet  format. The broadsheet format was retained for the Saturday edition.  === Organisational restructuring === In April 2007, APN NZ announced it was outsourcing the bulk of the ''Herald'''s [[copy editing  to an Australian-owned company, Pagemasters.  In November 2012, two months after the launch of its new compact format, APN News and Media announced it would be restructuring its workforce, cutting eight senior roles from across the ''Herald'''s range of titles.  == Political stance and editorial opinion == ''The Herald'' is traditionally a centre-right newspaper, and was given the nickname ""Granny Herald"" into the 1990s. This changed with the acquisition of the paper by Independent News & Media in 1996, and today, despite remaining [[free enterprise  oriented on economic matters such as trade and foreign investment, the Herald is generally editorially [[Progressivism|progressive  on international geopolitics, diplomacy, and military matters, printing material from British newspapers such as ''[[The Independent '' and ''[[The Observer '' but more recently, conservative newspapers such as ''[[The Daily Telegraph ''. It also regularly reprints syndicated material from the socially and politically conservative, right-wing British tabloid the ''[[Daily Mail#Editorial stance|Daily Mail ''. The ''Herald'' stance on the Middle East is supportive of Israel, as seen most clearly in its 2003 censorship and dismissal of cartoonist [[Malcolm Evans  cartoonist |Malcolm Evans  following his submission of cartoons critical of Israel.  On domestic matters, editorial opinion is centrist, usually supporting [[socially conservative  values. In 2007, an editorial strongly disapproved of some legislation introduced by the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour-led government , the [[Electoral Finance Act , to the point of overtly campaigning against the legislation.  == Ethics incident == In July 2015, the [[New Zealand Press Council  ruled that ''Herald'' columnist Rachel Glucina had failed to properly represent herself as a journalist when seeking comment from Amanda Bailey on a complaint she had made about Prime Minister [[John Key  repeatedly pulling her hair when he was a customer at the cafe in which she worked. The ''Herald'' published Bailey's name, photo, and comments after she had retracted permission for Glucina to do so. The council said there was an “element of subterfuge” in Glucina's actions and that there was not enough public interest to justify her behaviour. In its ruling the council said that, “The NZ Herald has fallen sadly short of those standards in this case.” The ''Herald'''s editor denied the accusations of subterfuge. Glucina subsequently resigned from the newspaper.  == Titles ==  ===''The Weekend Herald''=== In 1998 the Weekend Herald was set up as a separate title and the newspaper's website was launched.  === ''Herald on Sunday'' === A compact-sized Sunday edition, the ''Herald on Sunday'', was first published on 3 October 2004 under the editorship of Suzanne Chetwin and then, for five years, by [[Shayne Currie . It won Newspaper of the Year for the calendar years 2007 and 2009 and is New Zealand's second-highest-circulating weekly newspaper after the more established and conservative broadsheet, ''[[The Sunday Star-Times ''. In 2010, the ''Herald on Sunday'' started a campaign to reduce the legal blood alcohol limit for driving in New Zealand, called the ""Two Drinks Max"" campaign. The paper set up a campaign [[Facebook  page, a [[Twitter  account, and encouraged readers to sign up to the campaign on its own website.  It is currently edited by [[Miriyana Alexander .  === ''Herald Online'' website === The newspaper's online news service, originally called ''Herald Online'', was established in 1998. It was redesigned in late 2006, and again in 2012.  The site was named best news website at the 2007 and 2008 [[Qantas Media Award s, won the ""best re-designed website"" category at the 2007 New Zealand [[NetGuide  Awards, and was one of seven newspaper sites named an Official Honouree in the 2007 [[Webby Awards .<ref name=""NZ_Herald_10440446""></ref>  == Editors == *''The New Zealand Herald'': Murray Kirkness *''The Weekend Herald'': Miriyana Alexander *''The Herald on Sunday'': Miriyana Alexander  == Regular columnists == * [[Deborah Coddington , ''Herald on Sunday'' * [[Matt McCarten , ''Herald on Sunday'' * [[Brian Rudman  * [[Colin James  journalist |Colin James  is a past columnist  ==Arms==   == References ==   == External links == *  *  * [http://www.soldonapn.co.nz Sold on APN]  for advertisers       [[Category:Newspapers published in New Zealand  [[Category:Media in Auckland  [[Category:Companies based in Auckland  [[Category:Publications established in 1863  [[Category:New Zealand Media and Entertainment  [[Category:1863 establishments in New Zealand ","The New Zealand Herald is a daily newspaper published in Auckland, New Zealand, owned by New Zealand Media and Entertainment.

480,Y,seattlepi.com,"     The '''''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'''''  popularly known as the '''''Seattle P-I''''', the '''''Post-Intelligencer''''', or simply the '''''P-I'''''  is an [[online newspaper  and former print newspaper based in [[Seattle , [[Washington  state |Washington , United States.  The newspaper was founded in 1863 as the weekly '''''Seattle Gazette''''', and was later published daily in [[broadsheet  format. It was long one of the city's two daily newspapers, along with ''[[The Seattle Times '', until it became an online-only publication on March 18, 2009.  ==History== [[File:Seattle P-I final cover20090317.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.74|The front page<br/>of the last printed edition<br/>of the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'',<br/>published on March 17, 2009.   J.R. Watson founded the ''P-I'', Seattle's first newspaper, on December 10, 1863, as the ''Seattle Gazette''.<ref name=""pi-history""> </ref><ref name=""pi-historylink""></ref> The paper failed after a few years and was renamed the ''Weekly Intelligencer'' in 1867 by the new owner, Sam Maxwell.  In 1878, after publishing the ''Intelligencer'' as a morning daily, [[Thaddeus Hanford  bought the ''Daily Intelligencer'' for $8,000. Hanford also acquired the daily ''Puget Sound Dispatch'' and the weekly ''Pacific Tribune'' and folded both papers into the ''Intelligencer''. In 1881, the ''Intelligencer'' merged with the ''Seattle Post''. The names were combined to form the present-day name.<ref name=""pi-historylink"" />  In 1886, Indiana businessman [[Leigh S. J. Hunt  came to Seattle and purchased the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', which he owned and published until he was forced to sell in the [[Panic of 1893 .<ref name=Historylink8956></ref> At this point the newspaper was acquired by attorney and real estate developer [[James D. Hoge  under whom it was representative of an establishment viewpoint. It was the state's predominant newspaper. Circulation was greatly increased by coverage of the [[Klondike Gold Rush  in 1897. Hoge who was involved in other business sought to find a buyer and sold in 1899. The newspaper was acquired with assistance from [[James J. Hill  by [[John L. Wilson  who had first started the Seattle Klondike Information Bureau. The newspaper was acquired by Hearst in 1921.  Circulation stood at 31,000 in 1911.<ref name=""pi-history"" /> In 1912, editor Eric W. Allen left the paper to found the [[University of Oregon  School of Journalism, which he ran until his death in 1944.  [[William Randolph Hearst  took over the paper in 1921, and the [[Hearst Corporation  owns the ''P-I'' to this day.<ref name=""pi-historylink"" />  In 1936, 35 P-I writers and members of [[The Newspaper Guild  went on [[1936 Seattle Post-Intelligencer strike|three-month strike  against ""arbitrary dismissals and assignment changes and other 'efficiency' moves by the newspaper."" The [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters  joined the strike in solidarity. Roger Simpson and William Ames co-wrote their book ''Unionism or Hearst: the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Strike of 1936'' on the topic.    [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin  and [[Eleanor Roosevelt  had a special relationship with the ''P-I''.  Also in 1936, their son-in-law [[Clarence John Boettiger  took over as publisher.  He brought his wife [[Anna Roosevelt Halsted|Anna , the Roosevelts' daughter, to also work at the paper. Anna became editor of the women's page. Boettiger left Seattle to enter the U.S. Army in April 1943, while Anna stayed at the paper to help keep a liberal voice in the running of the paper. After Boettiger's absence, the paper increasingly turned conservative with Hearst's new acting publisher. Anna left Seattle in December 1943 to live in the White House with her youngest child, Johnny. This effectively ended the Roosevelt-Boettiger ties with the ''P-I''.<ref name= ""A Love in Shadow by John R. Boettiger"" ></ref>  On December 15, 2006, no copies were printed as a result of a power outage caused by the [[December 2006 Pacific Northwest storms . It was the first time in 70 years that publication had been suspended.<ref name=""dec2006-no-print""></ref>  On January 9, 2009, the Hearst Corporation announced that after losing money on it every year since 2000, Hearst was putting the ''P-I'' up for sale.<ref name=""nytimes-2009jan""></ref><ref name=""pi-2009jan9""></ref> The paper would be put on the market for 60 days, and if a buyer could not be found within that time, the paper would either be turned into an Internet-only publication with a drastically reduced staff, or closed outright.<ref name=""nytimes-2009jan""/><ref name=""pi-2009jan9""/> The news of the paper's impending sale was initially broken by local station [[KING-TV  the night prior to the official announcement, and came as a surprise to the ''P-I''s staff and the owners of rival newspaper the ''Seattle Times''. Analysts did not expect a buyer to be found, in view of declining circulation in the U.S. newspaper industry and other newspapers on the market going unsold.<ref name=""nytimes-2009jan""/> Five days before the 60-day deadline, the ''P-I'' reported that the Hearst Corporation had given several ''P-I'' reporters provisional job offers for an online edition of the ''P-I''.  On March 16, 2009, the newspaper posted a headline on its front page, followed shortly after by a short news story, that explained that the following day's edition would be its final one in print.<ref name=""pifrontpage""></ref> The newspaper's publisher, Roger Oglesby, was quoted saying that the ''P-I'' would continue as an online-only operation. Print subscribers had their subscriptions automatically transferred to the ''Seattle Times'' on March 18.  , the ''P-I'' continues as an online-only newspaper.  In September 2010, the site had an estimated 2.8 million unique visitors and 208,000 visitors per day.  ==Joint operating agreement== From 1983 to 2009, the ''P-I'' and ''[[The Seattle Times '' had a [[joint operating agreement   JOA  whereby [[advertising , [[Production, costs, and pricing|production , [[marketing , and circulation were run for both papers by the Seattle Times Company. They maintained separate [[news  and [[editorial  departments. The papers published a combined Sunday edition, although the ''Times'' handled the majority of the editorial content while the ''P-I'' only provided a small editorial/opinions section.  In 2003 ''Times'' tried to cancel the JOA, citing a clause in it that three consecutive years of [[Profit  accounting |losses  were cause for cancelling the agreement.<ref name = ""JOA""></ref>  Hearst disagreed and immediately filed suit to prevent the ''Times'' from cancelling the agreement. Hearst argued that a ''[[force majeure '' clause prevented the ''Times'' from claiming losses in 2000 and 2001 as reason to end the JOA, because they resulted from extraordinary events  in this case, a seven-week newspaper [[Strike action|strike  .  Each side publicly accused the other of attempting to put its rival out of business. The trial judge granted a summary judgment in Hearst's favor on the ''force majeure'' issue. But after two appeals, the [[state supreme court|Washington State Supreme Court  ruled in favor of the ''Times'' on June 30, 2005, on the ''force majeure'' clause, reversing the trial-court judge.  The two papers settled the issue on April 16, 2007.  The JOA ended in 2009 with the cessation of the ''P-I'' print edition.<ref name=""pifrontpage""/>  ==Awards== The ''P-I'' was notable for its two-time [[Pulitzer Prize -winning [[editorial cartoonist , [[David Horsey .  ===Report on Judge Gary Little=== Investigative reporting on [[King County Superior Court  Judge [[Gary Little 's out-of-court contact with juvenile defendants revealed accusations that Little [[Sexual abuse#Child sexual abuse|molested  young boys while he was a teacher at Seattle's exclusive [[Lakeside School  Seattle, Washington |Lakeside School  between 1968 and 1971. It also revealed inappropriate contact between Little and juveniles appearing before him after he became a judge. On August 19, 1988, after reporter Duff Wilson called the judge to advise him the newspaper was publishing the story, Little shot himself in the [[King County Courthouse . The [[ethics|ethical debates  surrounding the publication of the storyand the network of connections that protected Littleare taught in [[journalism  classes, and led to reforms in the way judges are disciplined in Washington state.  ===Conduct Unbecoming series=== In 2006 the ''P-I'' became the subject of a complaint to the [[Washington News Council  for its reporting on the [[King County, Washington|King County  [[King County, Washington Sheriff's Office|Sheriff's Office .  The media watch-dog group ruled against the ''P-I'', agreeing with Sheriff Sue Rahr's complaint that the newspaper had unfairly disparaged the Sheriff's Office.  The ''P-I'' declined to participate in the proceedings, and opted instead to give a detailed reply on its website.  ==The P-I Globe== [[File:Seattle P-I Globe 2  2014 .jpg|thumb|right|The P-I Globe is an official Seattle Landmark.  The ''P-I'' is known for the 13.5-ton,  [[Neon sign|neon  globe atop its headquarters on the [[Elliott Bay  waterfront, which features the words ""It's in the P-I"" rotating around the globe and an  eagle perched atop with wings stretched upwards.<ref name=""keep globe""></ref> The globe originated from a 1947 readers' contest to determine a new symbol for the paper. Out of 350 entrants, the winner was by Jack  known as Jakk  C. Corsaw, a University of Washington art student.<ref name=landmark-designation></ref> The globe was manufactured in 1948<ref name=landmark-designation/> and was placed atop the paper's then-new headquarters building at 6th Avenue and Wall Street. When the newspaper moved its headquarters again in 1986, to its current location on the waterfront, the globe was relocated to the new building.<ref name=""keep globe""/> Over the decades since its first installation, the globe has become a city landmark that, to locals, is as iconic as the [[Space Needle . A stylized rendering of the globe appeared on the masthead of the newspaper in its latter years and continues to feature on its website.  In April 2012, it was designated a Seattle Landmark by the city's [[City of Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board|Landmarks Preservation Board .<ref name=landmark-designation/><ref name=landmark-komo></ref> Mayor [[Ed Murray  Washington politician |Ed Murray  signed a city ordinance that had been passed by the [[Seattle City Council  on December 17, 2015 that designated the globe as an official city landmark.  In March 2012, the globe was donated to the [[Museum of History and Industry , which planned to refurbish and relocate it, but as of fall 2018 this had not occurred.  ==Notable employees== Notable employees of the ''P-I'' have included the novelists [[E. B.

In its beginning years, the site had a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing  orientation and known for its advocacy of the [[War on Terrorism  and the [[Iraq War , as well its strident criticism of political Islam. The blog moved away from the right around 2009.  ==Overview== The site originally had a ""[[right wing "" orientation. It was one of the most well-known and vehement pro-War on Terrorism websites in the early days of the blogosphere.   Johnson stated in 2006:</ref>   After eight years of being a leading right wing blog, LGF started condemning racism and the far-right  especially the Belgian party [[Vlaams Belang  . After that, the site abruptly switched sides and now ""LGF has become better known for the various fights it picks with many on the right.""<ref name=""David Weigel""></ref> During the transition period, Johnson deleted many of his more extreme past entries on the site, deleted entire comment sections, and banned many of the former right wing commentators from the site.  More recently, in 2009, Johnson stated  On November 30, 2009, Johnson blogged that he was disassociating himself with ""[[Right-wing politics|the right ,"" writing: ""The American right wing has gone off the rails, into the bushes, and off the cliff. I won't be going over the cliff with them."" He has been heavily critical of conservatives and libertarians since then.  Earlier, after [[September 11 attacks|the September 11, 2001 attacks , Johnson—who has described himself as ""pretty much [[center-left  before 9/11""—transformed his blog into a discussion of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict .  LGF won the ""Best Israel Advocacy Blog"" award from the ''[[Jerusalem Post '' in 2005. In 2004 Gil Ronen, a reporter for Internet news outlet ''[[Arutz Sheva '', stated that ""If anyone ever compiles a list of Internet sites that contribute to Israel's public relations effort, Johnson's site will probably come in first, far above the Israeli Foreign Ministry's site.""  In the [[United States , LGF is perhaps best known for playing a key role in exposing the fraud of the [[Killian documents  regarding President [[George W. Bush ,<ref name=LGF12526></ref><ref name=HK2004.0919></ref> which preceded the resignation of [[CBS 's [[Dan Rather . The site won the ''[[Washington Post ''s reader poll for Best International Blog in November 2004 and played a role in bringing attention to altered photographs in the [[Adnan Hajj photographs controversy . In July 2008, LGF identified that photographs of Iran's missile test had been altered, and was credited by much of the media for this.  ===Name=== The name ""Little Green Footballs"" has not been explained by Charles Johnson. The most he has said about it is:  <blockquote>I am at liberty to reveal that it has something to do with an incident in my youth that happened in Japan.</blockquote>  ===Alteration and deletion of posts=== In early September, 2010, it was discovered that Johnson had begun altering some posts and deleting others which expressed sentiments which were substantively similar to the ones he had recently been condemning others for. In one example, Johnson had been condemning opponents of the [[Park51  project as ""bigots"", though he had expressed similar opposition to the proposed [[Flight 93 National Memorial|Flight 93 memorial , which he described as an ""Islamic Shrine"". Johnson was discovered to have deleted these posts without acknowledging their deletion. Johnson had also described the lead figure in the Park51 project, [[Feisal Abdul Rauf , as an ""Islamic Supremacist,"" but later revised that description from the post without acknowledging the change.  ===Software=== The software for the website was written by Johnson himself in [[PHP . Until Spring 2007, all data was stored in [[flat file s. The website now uses [[MySQL .  ==Notable events==  ===Killian documents===  [[Image:Killian memos MSWord animated.gif|right|thumb|[[:Image:Killian memos MSWord animated.gif|The animated GIF image  created by Charles Johnson and posted at LGF, comparing a 2004-era Microsoft Word document made with default settings to the document that CBS presented as a typewritten memo from 1973. LGF was one of four sources, along with the [[Power Line  blog |Power Line  and [[Allah Is in the House|Allahpundit  blogs and the [[Free Republic  discussion forum, who conducted the initial investigation of [[Dan Rather 's assertions on ''[[60 Minutes '' that the Killian documents were genuine.  ===Charitable contributions=== Little Green Footballs supporters have helped raise thousands of dollars for [[Spirit of America  company |Spirit of America 's ""Friends of Iraq Blogger Challenge"". Supporters also donate pizzas for [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF  soldiers. In the immediate aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina  several registered users also offered their direct services donating and transporting goods to the hardest hit, inviting contributions from other readers. Johnson also posted a number of links to charitable efforts  and thanked his readers for their response.  ===Pajamas Media===  In late 2005 Johnson, along with blogger and author [[Roger L. Simon  launched a news site called [[Pajamas Media   briefly called ''Open Source Media''  featuring mostly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative  and [[Libertarianism|libertarian  bloggers and journalists  e.g., [[Michelle Malkin , [[Glenn Reynolds , [[Michael Barone  pundit |Michael Barone , [[Tammy Bruce , [[John Podhoretz , [[Michael Ledeen , [[Catherine Seipp|Cathy Seipp   with some [[liberalism in the United States|liberal  participants  e.g., [[David Corn , [[Marc Cooper  . The name refers to [[Jonathan Klein  CNN |Jonathan Klein 's comment about bloggers working in their pajamas.  As of 15 September 2009, Johnson has removed all links to [[Pajamas Media  sites from Little Green Footballs.  ===Doctored photographs===  On August 5, 2006, LGF showed how a photograph of [[Beirut  after an Israeli air strike taken by [[Reuters  photographer  [[Adnan Hajj photographs controversy|Adnan Hajj  was manipulated before being published by Reuters.<ref name=ynet0806></ref>   On July 10, 2008 the website documented alterations to photos of Iranian missile tests. Fox News credited the website for discovering the doctored photos.  ===Awards=== Little Green Footballs once had two annual awards; The Fiskie and The Fallaci.  The Fiskie was named after journalist [[Robert Fisk , in a blog post where Johnson notes that, after having been captured and beaten by Afghan refugees, Fisk claimed he sympathized with them.  The award was given to people who in the previous year best embodied the ""Idiotarian"" worldview. The Fallaci was named after the late [[Oriana Fallaci , and given to people who in the previous year best embodied the ""Anti-Idiotarian"" worldview.  Johnson had previously allowed his users to nominate and vote on candidates for both awards.  The Fallaci was discontinued without explanation after 2007. Johnson quietly removed a link to her memorial site from the blog during his ideological shift in 2008.  The Fiskie was discontinued after 2009.  That year, rather than allow the community to vote, Johnson unilaterally awarded the Fiskie to [[Glenn Beck .  ==Recurring themes==  ===Pre-2009===  ====Slang==== Discussing slang terms used by Johnson and his readers, Paul Farhi, a writer for the ''[[Washington Post '', notes:  ::''...Little Green Footballs doesn't always traffic in subtlety and nuance. Dissenting points of view often are dismissed as ""idiotarian"" or ""LLL""  for ""loony liberal left"" , and Islam is mockingly referred to as ""RoP"", meaning ""[[Religion of Peace|religion of peace "".''<ref name=""autogenerated1"" />  ====Monitoring and exposing rival websites for revisionist editing==== Charles Johnson's posts on LGF frequently call attention to what he regards as unethical revisionism on the part of rival blogs.  ====Ideological influences==== Charles Johnson's posts on LGF frequently cited the writing of authors representing [[Neoconservative  viewpoints, such as [[Victor Davis Hanson , [[Charles Krauthammer , [[Mark Steyn , [[James Lileks , and Oriana Fallaci. Johnson has expressed a strong disdain for the [[Tea Party protests . Since his strong break with the right, he has come to openly criticize many of those same writers. He frequently references climate blogger Peter Sinclair in posts about global warming.  ====Palestinian child abuse==== Johnson often posts photos taken by Associated Press and Reuters photographers, among others, of Palestinians dressing their children in paramilitary uniforms, or in clothing emblazoned with violent slogans such as ""Death to Israel."" These children are often shown carrying real guns and even wearing mock-ups of the explosive belts used by suicide bombers. Johnson refers to such photographs as evidence of Palestinian [[child abuse .  ====Rachel Corrie==== Johnson has stated many times that he is disgusted with media coverage of the death of [[International Solidarity Movement  activist [[Rachel Corrie , who was killed by an Israeli [[bulldozer  in [[Rafah , a town in the [[Gaza Strip .<ref name=lgf6228></ref> Johnson disputes the ISM's account, holding that Corrie, who was regularly mocked as ""Saint Pancake"" on his website, was ""trying to 'protect' a house used for drugs and weapons smuggling"".<ref name=lgf6228/> Johnson states:  ::''Rachel Corrie was emphatically not a ""peace activist"". She sided with terrorists and criminals, and advocated—in fact, was excited by—violence and mass murder.''<ref name=""autogenerated2""></ref>  In support of this view, he has cited<ref name=""autogenerated2"" /> a diary entry from Corrie, which Johnson characterizes as expressing the view that Palestinian violence towards Israel is justifiable and laudable.<ref name=""autogenerated2"" />  In posts about her on LGF, Johnson often features a photo of Corrie burning a hand-drawn American flag and surrounded by Palestinian children.<ref name=lgf6228/>  ====Intelligent Design criticism==== LGF has been ideologically opposed to [[Intelligent Design , and Johnson regularly posts to criticize the subject and those who endorse it. He is particularly critical of Louisiana Governor [[Bobby Jindal  on this point. In 2009, he stated that the Republican Party's having visible advocates of Intelligent Design is one of the reasons that the Democrats were in power.  ===Post-2009===  ====Edward Snowden==== Johnson has been critical of [[Edward Snowden  and his [[Global surveillance disclosures  2013–present |disclosures . In 2014, he asserted that ""Snowden himself committed a truly massive violation of civil liberties"".  ==Registration and posting protocols==  ===Posting filter=== Johnson has put in place a filter which stops LGF members from using certain derogatory and racist terms in their posts to the site. Johnson stresses that the number of comments filtered in this way are ""minuscule."" The filter is intended to prevent abuse going unnoticed.  ===Rivalries=== Johnson and LGF ""regulars""  the self-proclaimed ""[[Reptilian humanoid|Lizardoids ""  have engaged in a number of high-profile [[feud s and [[Flaming  Internet |flame wars , pitting LGF supporters against readers of other blogs  e.g., [[Daily Kos  and later [[Michelle Malkin#Hot Air website and MichelleMalkin.com|Hot Air   and alternative media sites  e.g., [[Fark  and [[Digg  .  As of 2014, one of Charles Johnson's main targets is an [[alt-right  figure and well-known [[Internet troll  with the same first and last name as him. When speaking of [[Charles C. Johnson , the LGF owner takes pains to point out that this doppelganger ""is not me.""  ===Redirects=== Johnson often redirects incoming links from sites critical of LGF to the [[Israel Defense Forces  homepage.  Following a news release which [[Council on American-Islamic Relations|CAIR  sent to pay-for-play organization PRNewswire.com, Johnson redirected the news release's link traffic to a site regarding [[Council on American-Islamic Relations|CAIR 's alleged ties to terrorist organizations. [[Council on American-Islamic Relations|CAIR  responded by having the links removed from the press release.  ==Controversies==  ===Allegations of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim sentiment=== *R. J. Smith, writing in ''Los Angeles Magazine'', stated that LGF is a ""dysfunctional mix of beautiful photos Johnson takes on coastal bike rides and constitutionally protected hate speech"" which ""believes all Muslims are terrorists until proven innocent.""  *[[Ibrahim Hooper , spokesman for the [[Council of American Islamic Relations   CAIR  called Little Green Footballs ""a vicious, anti-Muslim hate site"" and says that the FBI has ""investigated several threats of physical harm against Muslims posted by Little Green Footballs readers"".<ref name=""autogenerated1"" /> *[[Columnist  [[Antonia Zerbisias  has described LGF as a ""virulently anti-Muslim/Arab website"".  ===Google and Websense=== *In March 2005, Johnson called attention to Google's inclusion of the [[white supremacist  [[National Vanguard  American organization |National Vanguard  site  and simultaneous exclusion of LGF  in its news index; the NV site has since been dropped. *In April 2007 Johnson reported that Little Green Footballs was being blocked by [[Websense  under its ""Racism and Hate"" category. Websense admitted that the site had been thus categorized briefly  but incorrectly  and subsequently reversed the decision.  ===Statements about Ron Paul=== *Johnson removed Ron Paul's name from straw polls regarding the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Republican Presidential nomination campaign , asserting that Ron Paul's supporters were fraudulently gaming the vote script to increase Paul's numbers: ""The bottom line: if Ron Paul supporters weren’t spamming, he would still be in our polls. I really don’t have any nefarious motives here; I just don’t like being gamed, and since I run these silly unscientific polls I don’t have to put up with it."" According to Johnson, the tactic used was an organized campaign by Ron Paul supporters to notify other supporters of online polls and vote in them. *In December 2007, [[Libertarianism|libertarian  writer [[David Weigel  accused Johnson of launching a ""smear"" against [[Republican Party  United States |Republican  presidential candidate [[Ron Paul , writing in [[Reason Magazine  that:  : ''Little Green Footballs has moved, over the space of a few weeks, from mercilessly mocking [[Ron Paul  and banning him from its straw polls to putting him at the center of a conspiracy for worldwide Nazi domination. ''  Johnson's allegations were picked up in the ''[[New York Times '' ""Medium"" section, where [[Virginia Heffernan  cited LGF's coverage of claims by [[Bill White  neo-nazi |Bill White , writing:  : ''Little Green Footballs, the hawkish and rigidly empiricist blog that first furnished evidence of memo-forging in the Rathergate case, has started due diligence...''  ===Statements about Vlaams Belang=== In the wake of the Brussels Counterjihad 2007 conference held on October 17–18, 2007, Charles Johnson became openly critical of the [[Vlaams Belang  and [[Sweden Democrats , political parties he believes to be fascist or neo-Nazi in character. This resulted in a falling out with several other prominent right-wing bloggers, including [[Diana West , [[Robert Spencer  author |Robert Spencer , and [[Fjordman .  ==Media attention in the United States==  === 2002 === *[[MSNBC 's Will Femia wrote of LGF: ::''This site is the focus of considerable controversy for its focus  and particularly the focus of the constituents in its comments section  on Islamic culture and dogma as the source of Islamic terror. As a popular, active, and well presented site, it is worth checking out, but some may find its content hateful or even racist.''  *Syndicated columnist [[James Taranto  defended LGF after MSNBC 'smeared' Johnson.  ===2005=== *''[[Vanity Fair  magazine |Vanity Fair '' theater critic [[James Wolcott  characterized the LGF community as ''""sort of like a disorganized [[Nuremberg Rally , a lot of angry ruffians with nowhere to go....""''<ref name=headhunters></ref> after Johnson described an attack on [[Daniel Pipes  by Wolcott as ""the sort of high-toned writin’ that made Vanity Fair the journalistic juggernaut it is today"". *''[[The Weekly Standard '' described LGF as one of ""the saner precincts of the blogosphere"".  ===2006=== *[[Pajamas Media  contributor [[Catherine Seipp|Cathy Seipp  wrote in ''[[National Review '' that: ::''I'm losing patience with this notion, surely one of the most successful media [[Big Lie s of the past few years, that Charles runs a racist hate site. By now it's been repeated so often that even normally reasonable people believe it.''  ===2009=== *Charles Johnson and LGF received attention from the leftist blog the ''[[Huffington Post '' because of a blog post of Johnsons disassociating himself from ""[[Right-wing politics|the right""  because of perceived, ""anti-Islamic bigotry that goes far beyond simply criticizing radical Islam, into support for [[fascism , violence, and genocide,"" embracing of conspiracy theories, and hate speech.<ref name=""huffingtonpost.com"">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/01/little-green-footballs-ch_n_375357.html Huffingtonpost.com]</ref>  ===2010=== *Author and journalist Jonathan Dee wrote a lengthy profile of Johnson for ''[[The New York Times Magazine ''. Johnson later criticized the article for its negative slant and for lending too much weight to the opinions of people whom, Johnson wrote, the ''Times'' would ""normally assign to the 'wacko far right bigot' category"".  ==References==   ==External links==  * [http://littlegreenfootballs.com/ littlegreenfootballs.com] home page  [[Category:Alternative media  [[Category:American political blogs  [[Category:Warblogs  [[Category:Blogs critical of Islam ","Little Green Footballs  LGF  is an American political blog run by web designer Charles Johnson.

[[Bo Hi Pak , the chief aide of church founder and leader [[Sun Myung Moon , was the founding president and the founding chairman of the board. Moon asked [[Richard L. Rubenstein , a rabbi and college professor who had written on the [[Holocaust , to serve on the board of directors. ''The Washington Times'' first editor and publisher was [[James R. Whelan .  At the time of founding of ''The Washington Times'', Washington had only one major newspaper, ''[[The Washington Post ''. [[Massimo Introvigne , in his 2000 book ''The Unification Church'', said that the ''Post'' had been ""the most anti-Unificationist paper in the United States."" In 2002, at an event held to celebrate ''The Washington Times'' 20th anniversary, Moon said: ""''The Washington Times'' is responsible to let the American people know about God"" and ""''The Washington Times'' will become the instrument in spreading the truth about God to the world.""<ref name=""Washington Post""></ref>  ''The Washington Times'' was founded the year after the ''[[Washington Star '', the previous ""second paper"" of D.C., went out of business. A large percentage of the staff came from the ''Washington Star''. When ''The Washington Times'' began, it was unusual among American [[broadsheet s in publishing a full color front page, along with full color front pages in all its sections and color elements throughout. It also used ink that it advertised as being less likely to come off on the reader's hands than the type used by the ''Post''.<ref name=""'70s 146""></ref> When ''The Washington Times'' began it had 125 reporters, 25 percent of them Unification Church members.  Some former employees, including Whelan, have insisted that ''The Washington Times'' was always under Moon's control. Whelan, whose contract guaranteed editorial autonomy, left the paper when the owners refused to renew the contract. Three years later, editorial page editor William P. Cheshire and four of his staff resigned, charging that, at the explicit direction of Sang Kook Han, a top official of the Unification movement, then-editor Arnaud de Borchgrave had stifled editorial criticism of political repression in South Korea. In 1982, ''The Washington Times'' refused to publish film critic Scott Sublett's negative review of the movie ''[[Inchon  film |Inchon '', which was also sponsored by the Unification movement.<ref name=""romano""></ref>  After a brief editorship under [[Smith Hempstone , [[Arnaud de Borchgrave   formerly of the United Press International and ''Newsweek''  was executive editor from 1985 to 1991.<ref name=Gamarekian></ref> Borchgrave was credited for encouraging energetic reporting by staff, but was known to make unorthodox journalistic decisions. During his tenure, ''The Washington Times'' mounted a fund-raising drive for [[Contras  rebels in [[Nicaragua  and offered rewards for information leading to the arrest of [[Nazi war criminals .

He had been at ''The Washington Times'' since 1982, working as a correspondent and later as managing editor.<ref name="":18""></ref> During his editorship, the paper took a strongly conservative stance. Controversy ensued when Pruden was accused of pushing [[Nativism  politics |nativism .[[File:2008 07 The Washington Times newsroom 02.jpg|thumb|247x247px|''The Washington Times'' newsroom  In 1992 [[North Korea n president [[Kim Il Sung  gave his first and only interview with the Western news media to ''Washington Times'' reporter [[Josette Sheeran   who later became Executive Director of the [[United Nations World Food Programme  .  In 1992, ''The Washington Times'' had only one-eighth the circulation of the ''Post''  100,000 compared to 800,000  and that two-thirds of its subscribers also subscribed to the ''Post''. In 1994, ''The Washington Times'' introduced a weekly national edition. It was published in a tabloid format and distributed nationwide.<ref name=""nyt1994"">[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/27/business/the-media-business-conservative-daily-tries-to-expand-national-niche.html?pagewanted=all Conservative Daily Tries to Expand National Niche], ''[[The New York Times '', June 27, 1994</ref>  In 1992 [[Walter Goodman  critic |Walter Goodman , writing in the ''New York Times'', said that the administration of [[George H. W. Bush  was encouraging the political influence of ''The Washington Times'' and other Unification movement activism in support of United States foreign policy.  In 1997 the ''[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs ,'' which is critical of U.S. and Israeli policies, praised ''The Washington Times'' along with ''[[The Christian Science Monitor ,'' owned by the [[Church of Christ, Scientist , and ''The Washington Times'' sister publication ''[[News World Communications|The Middle East Times ,'' for what it called their objective and informative coverage of Islam and the [[Middle East , while criticizing the generally pro-Israel editorial policy of ''The Washington Times''. The ''Report'' suggested that these newspapers, being owned by religious institutions, were less influenced by pro-Israel pressure groups in the United States.  In 2004, ''Washington Post'' columnist [[David Ignatius  reported that [[Chung Hwan Kwak , a top leader of the Unification movement, wanted ''The Washington Times'' to ""support international organizations such as the United Nations and to campaign for world peace and interfaith understanding."" This, Ignatious wrote, created difficulties for Pruden and some of ''The Washington Times'' columnists.   Ignatius also mentioned the Unification movement's reconciliatory attitude towards [[North Korea , which at the time included joint business ventures, and Kwak's advocacy for greater understanding between the United States and the [[Islamic world  as issues of contention.  Ignatius predicted that conservatives in Congress and the [[George W. Bush  administration would support Pruden's position over Kwak's.    In 2006 Moon's second oldest son [[Hyun Jin Moon , president and CEO of ''The Washington Times'' [[parent company  [[News World Communications , was in the process of ousting managing editor Francis Coombs because of accusations of [[racist  editorializing. Coombs had made a number of racist and sexist comments, for which he was in the process of being sued by his colleagues.  ===Post-Pruden years=== [[File:2008 09 The Washington Times - Printing and Distribution Center.jpg|thumb|The printing and distribution center of ''The Washington Times''  In January 2008, Pruden retired and [[John F. Solomon  began as executive editor of ''The Washington Times''. Solomon had previously worked for the [[Associated Press  and ''The Washington Post'', and had most recently been head of investigative reporting and mixed media development at the ''Post''. Within a month, ''The Washington Times'' changed some of its [[style guide  to conform more to what was becoming mainstream media usage. ''The Washington Times'' announced that it would no longer use words like ""illegal aliens"" and ""homosexual,"" and in most cases opt for ""more neutral terminology"" like ""illegal immigrants"" and ""gay,"" respectively. ''The Washington Times'' also decided to stop using ""Hillary"" when referring to Senator [[Hillary Clinton , and the word ""marriage"" in the expression ""gay marriage"" would no longer appear in quotes in the newspaper. These changes in policy drew criticism from some conservatives.<ref name=salonfeb></ref> ''[[Prospect  magazine |Prospect '' magazine attributed the ''Times'' apparent political moderation to differences of opinion over the [[United Nations  and [[North Korea , and said: ""The [[Republican Party  United States |Republican  right may be losing its most devoted media ally.""[[File:Washington Times dispenser.jpg|thumb|200px|''Times'' dispenser In November 2009 ''The New York Times'' reported that ''The Washington Times'' would no longer be receiving funds from the Unification movement and might have to cease publication or go to online publication only.<ref name=""nyt1212009"">[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/business/media/01moon.html With Tumult at the Top, ''Washington Times'' Faces Uncertainty], ''[[The New York Times '', November 30, 2009.</ref> Later that year, ''The Washington Times'' fired 40 percent of its 370 employees and stopped its subscription service, instead distributing the paper free in some areas of Washington including branches of the government. A subscription website owned by the paper, theconservatives.com, continued, as did ''The Washington Times'' three-hour radio program, ''America's Morning News''. ''The Washington Times'' announced that it would cease publication of its Sunday edition, along with other changes partly in order to end its reliance on subsidies from the Unification movement ownership. On December 31, 2009, it announced that it would no longer be a full-service newspaper, eliminating its metropolitan-news and sports sections.  In July 2010, the Unification movement issued a letter protesting the direction ''The Washington Times'' was taking and urging closer ties with it. In August 2010, a deal was made to sell ''The Washington Times'' to a group more closely related to the movement. Editor in chief [[Sam Dealey  said that this was a welcome development among ''The Washington Times'' staff. In November 2010, Moon and a group of former editors purchased ''The Washington Times'' from News World Communications for $1. This ended a conflict within the Moon family that had been threatening to shut down ''The Washington Times'' completely. In March 2011 ''The Washington Times'' announced that some former staffers would be rehired and that the paper would bring back its sports, metro, and life sections. In June 2011, Ed Kelley, formerly of ''[[The Oklahoman '', was hired as editor overseeing both news and opinion content.  In 2012, Douglas D. M. Joo stepped down as senior executive, president, and chairman of ''The Washington Times''. ''The Washington Times'' president Tom McDevitt took his place as chairman, and Larry Beasley was hired as the company's new president and chief executive officer.  In 2013, ''The Washington Times'' worked with Herring Networks to create the new conservative cable news channel [[One America News , which began broadcasting in mid‑2013.  In July 2013, [[John F. Solomon  returned as editor and also served as vice president of content and business development. Around the same time, ''The Washington Times'' hired [[David Keene , the former president of the [[National Rifle Association  and [[American Conservative Union  chairman, to serve as its opinion editor. Solomon's tenure was marked by a focus on profitability. Solomon left ''The Washington Times'' for [[Circa News  in December 2015.  ===Finances=== In 1991, Moon said he had spent between $900 million and $1 billion on ''The Washington Times''. By 2002, Moon had spent between $1.7 billion and $2 billion according to different estimates.<ref name=""wash-chinni.asp2"" /> ''The Washington Times'' had its first profitable month in September 2015, ending the streak of losses in the paper's first 33 years.  ==Political stance, content and controversies== ''The Washington Times'' holds a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative  political stance.<ref name=""Hall""></ref><ref name=""Glaberson""></ref><ref name="":0""></ref><ref name="":5""> Erdoan A.

In a 2008 ''[[Harper's Magazine '' essay criticizing [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism , American historian [[Thomas Frank  linked ''The Washington Times'' to the modern American conservative movement, saying, ""There is even a daily newspaper—''The Washington Times''—published strictly for the movement's benefit, a propaganda sheet whose distortions are so obvious and so alien that it puts one in mind of those official party organs one encounters when traveling in authoritarian countries.""  In 2009, ''The New York Times'' noted that ''The Washington Times'' had been ""a crucial training ground for many rising conservative journalists and a must-read for those in the movement.

The civilization that we as whites created in Europe and America could not have developed apart from the genetic endowments of the creating people.""''<ref name=""Kurtz"" />'' When Francis died in 2005, the ''Times'' wrote a ""glowing"" obituary that omitted his racist and white nationalist beliefs, as well as his firing from ''The Washington Times'', and described him as a ""scholarly, challenging and sometimes pungent writer""; in response, the editorial page editor David Mastio for the conservative ''[[Washington Examiner '' wrote in an obituary that ""Sam Francis was merely a racist and doesn’t deserve to be remembered as anything less.""<ref name="":8""></ref><ref name="":17""></ref> Mastio added that Francis ""led a double life -- by day he served up conservative, red meat that was strong but never quite out of bounds by mainstream standards; by night, unbeknownst to the Times or his syndicate, he pushed white supremacist ideas.""<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":17"" />   The [[Southern Poverty Law Center   SPLC  noted that ''The Washington Times'' had by 2005 published at least 35 articles by Marian Kester Coombs, who was married to managing editor Fran Coombs. She had a record of racially incendiary rhetoric and who had written for the white nationalist magazine ''[[The Occidental Quarterly|Occidental Quarterly ''.<ref name="":11""></ref> The SPLC highlighted columns written by Marian Kester Coombs in ''The Washington Times'', in which she asserted that the whole of human history was a ""the struggle of ... races""; that non-white immigration is the ""importing [of] poverty and revolution"" that will end in ""the eventual loss of sovereign American territory""; and that Muslims in England ""are turning life in this once pleasant land into a misery for its native inhabitants.""<ref name="":11"" />  === Science coverage === ==== Climate change denial ==== ''The Washington Times'' is known for promoting [[climate change denial .<ref name="":20"" /><ref name="":21"" /><ref name=""Playing Climate-Change Telephone"" /><ref name="":2"" /><ref name="":3"" /> [[Michael E. Mann , director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, characterizes ''The Washington Times'' as a prominent outlet that propagates ""climate change disinformation.""<ref name="":20""></ref> [[Naomi Oreskes , Professor of the History of Science at Harvard University, and [[Erik M. Conway , historian of science at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, wrote in their 2010 book ''[[Merchants of Doubt '' that ''The Washington Times'' has given the public a false sense that the science of anthropogenic climate change was in dispute by giving disproportionate coverage of fringe viewpoints and by preventing scientists from rebutting coverage in the ''Times''.<ref name="":21""></ref> For example, ''The Washington Times'' reprinted a column by [[Steve Milloy  criticizing research of [[climate change in the Arctic , without disclosing Milloy's financial ties to the fossil fuel industry.  During the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy   also known as ""Climategate""  in 2009 in the lead-up to the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen Summit on climate change , ''The Washington Times'' wrote in an editorial ""these revelations of fudged science should have a cooling effect on global-warming hysteria and the panicked policies that are being pushed forward to address the unproven theory."" Eight committees investigated the controversy, and found no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct. In 2010, ''The Washington Times'' published an article claiming that February 2010 snow storms ""Undermin[e] The Case For Global Warming One Flake At A Time"". A 2014 ''Times'' editorial mocked the ""global warming scam"" and asserted, ""The planetary thermometer hasn’t budged in 15 years. Wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes and other ‘extreme’ weather events are at normal or below-normal levels. Pacific islands aren’t submerged. There’s so much ice the polar bears are celebrating.""<ref name="":19""></ref> ''The Washington Times'' cited a blog post in support of these claims; PolitiFact fact-checked the claims in the blog post and concluded it was ""pants-on-fire"" false.<ref name="":19"" /> In 2014, ''The Washington Times'' said that a [[NASA  scientist claimed that global warming was on a ""hiatus"" and that NASA had found evidence of global cooling; Rebecca Leber of the ''New Republic'' said that the NASA scientist in question said the opposite of what ''The Washington Times'' claimed. In 2015, it published a column by Congressman [[Lamar Smith  in which he argued that the work of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  was ""not good science, [but] science fiction.""<ref name="":3"" />  In 1993, ''The Washington Times'' published articles purporting to debunk climate change. ''The Washington Times'' headlined its story about the [[1997 Kyoto Protocol  on climate change, ""Under the deal, the use of coal, oil and other fossil fuel in the United States would be cut by more than one-third by 2002, resulting in lower standards of living for consumers and a long-term reduction in economic growth.""<ref name="":822""></ref>  ==== Ozone depletion denial==== In the 1990s, ''The Washington Times'' published columns which cast doubt on the scientific consensus on the causes of [[ozone depletion   which had led to an ""ozone hole"" . It published columns disputing the science as late as 2000.<ref name=""handful""/> In 1991, NASA scientists warned of the potential of a major Arctic ozone hole developing in the spring of 1992 due to elevated levels of chlorine monoxide in the Arctic stratosphere. However, as the Arctic winter was unusually warm, the chemical reactions needed for ozone depletion did not occur. Even though the science was not incorrect, ''The Washington Times''', along with other conservative media, subsequently created a ""[[The boy who cried wolf|crying wolf "" narrative where scientists were portrayed as political activists who were following an environmental agenda rather than the science. In 1992, ''The Washington Times'' published an editorial saying, ""This is not the disinterested, objective, just-the-facts tone one ordinarily expects from scientists... This is the cry of the apocalyptic, laying the groundwork for a decidedly non-scientific end: public policy... it would be nice if the next time NASA cries 'wolf,' fewer journalists, politicians and citizens heed the warning like sheep.""  ==== Second-hand smoke denial==== In 1995, ''The Washington Times'' published a column by [[Fred Singer , who is known for promoting views contrary to mainstream science on a number of issues, where Singer referred to the science on the adverse health impact of [[second-hand smoke  as the ""second-hand smoke scare"", and accused the Environmental Protection Agency of distorting data when it classified second-hand smoke as harmful.<ref name=""myths""/><ref name=""inq climate""/> In 1995, ''The Washington Times'' published an editorial titled ""How not to spend science dollars"" condemning a grant to the National Cancer Institute to study how political contributions from tobacco companies shape policy-making and the voting behavior of politicians.  === Hostile and false coverage of Barack Obama ===  ==== Birther conspiracy theories and Muslim smears ==== In 2008, ''The Washington Times'' published a column by [[Frank Gaffney  that promoted the false [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya  and was courting the ""jihadist vote."" Gaffney also published pieces in 2009 and 2010 promoting the false claim that [[Barack Obama religion conspiracy theories|Obama is a Muslim .<ref name=""Betsy Woodruff22""></ref><ref name=""Bump""/><ref name=""Eli Clifton22""></ref><ref name=""Robert Schlesinger22""></ref><ref name=""Nyhan22""></ref>   ==== No ""blood impulse"" for America ==== In a 2009 ''The Washington Times'' column entitled ""'Inner Muslim' at work in Cairo"", Pruden wrote that President Obama was the ""first president without an instinctive appreciation of the culture, history, tradition, common law and literature whence America sprang. The genetic imprint writ large in his 43 predecessors is missing from the Obama DNA.""<ref name="":4"" /> In another 2009 column, Pruden wrote that Obama had ""no natural instinct or blood impulse” for what America was about because he was “sired by a Kenyan father” and “born to a mother attracted to men of the Third World.""<ref name="":4"" /> These columns stirred controversy, leading ''The Washington Times'' to assign David Mastio, the Deputy Editorial Page Editor, to edit Pruden's work.<ref name="":4"" />  ==== Ted Nugent columns ==== [[Ted Nugent , a fervent critic of President Obama, published weekly columns for ''The Washington Times'' between 2010 and 2012.<ref name="":12""></ref><ref name="":13""></ref> Prior to joining the ''Times'', Nugent stirred controversy by referring to Obama as a ""piece of shit"" and calling on him ""to suck on my machine gun.""<ref name="":14""></ref><ref name="":13"" /> Nugent had also pleaded fealty to the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flag  before joining ''The Washington Times''.<ref name="":13"" /> In 2012, Nugent was visited by the Secret Service after he alluded to beheading President Obama.<ref name="":15""></ref><ref name="":16""></ref> He said that if Obama would win re-election, ""I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year."" At the time, the Mitt Romney campaign condemned Nugent's remarks; ''Washington Post'' media critic Erik Wemple noted that there was no response by ''The Washington Times''.<ref name="":13"" />  In 2014, Nugent  who had by then departed from ''The Washington Times''  described Obama as a ""subhuman [[mongrel "", which is a term for mixed-breed dogs.<ref name="":12"" /> ''Times'' editor Wesley Pruden condemned Nugent's remarks, describing Nugent as an ""aging rock musician with a loose mouth who was semifamous 40 years ago.""<ref name="":12"" /> In response to Pruden's condemnation, David Weigel remarked in ''Slate'', ""That long ago? Only a year ago, he filed a special column for the Washington Times. Before that, for a few years, he published a weekly column.""<ref name="":12"" />  ==== Other Obama controversies ==== In 2016, ''The Washington Times'' claimed that $3.6 million in federal funds were spent on a 2013 golf outing for President Obama and [[Tiger Woods . ''[[Snopes '' rated the article ""mostly false"", because the estimated cost included both official business travel and a brief presidential vacation in Florida.  === Seth Rich conspiracy theory op-ed === On March 1, 2018, ''The Washington Times'' published a commentary piece by retired U.S. Navy admiral [[James Lyons  admiral |James A. Lyons  which promoted conspiracy theories about the [[murder of Seth Rich . In the piece, Lyon claimed that it was ""well known in intelligence circles that Seth Rich and his brother, Aaron Rich, downloaded the DNC emails and was paid by Wikileaks for that information.""<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":6"" /> The piece cited no evidence for the assertion.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":1""></ref> Aaron Rich, the brother of Seth Rich and a subject of the false claim, filed a lawsuit against ''The Washington Times'', saying that it acted with ""reckless disregard for the truth"" and that it did not retract or remove the piece after ""receiving notice of the falsity of the statements about Aaron after the publication"".<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":1"" /> On September 30, 2018, Rich's attorney, Michael Gottlieb, reported that Rich and ''The Washington Times'' had settled their lawsuit and shortly after the settlement ''The Washington Times'' issued an ""unusually robust"" retraction.<ref name="":6""></ref>  === Anti-Muslim content === Frank Gaffney, known for his ""long history of pushing extreme anti-Muslim views"", wrote weekly columns for ''The Washington Times'' from the late 1990s to 2016. According to John Esposito, a Professor of Religion and International Affairs and of Islamic Studies at [[Georgetown University , Gaffney's ""editorial track record in the ''Washington Times'' is long on accusation and short on supportive evidence."" In columns for the ''Times'', Gaffney helped to popularize conspiracy theories that Muslim terrorists were infiltrating the Bush administration, the conservative movement and the Obama administration. In 2015, ''The Washington Times'' published a column describing refugees fleeing the Syrian Civil War as an ""Islamic Trojan Horse"" conducting a ""'jihad' by another name."" In a column on Islam, Ted Nugent wrote ""If Islam is the religion of peace, then I’m a malnourished, tofu-eating anti-hunter,"" but did clarify ""not all Muslims are religious whacks who deserve a bullet.""  In a 2016 report, the Muslim advocacy group [[Council on American–Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations  listed ''The Washington Times'' among media outlets it said ""regularly demonstrates or supports Islamophobic themes."" In 1998 the Egyptian newspaper ''[[Al-Ahram '' wrote that ''The Washington Times'' editorial policy was ""rabidly anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and pro-Israel.""  ===Support for Donald Trump=== ''The Washington Times'' opinion editor, [[Charles Hurt  was one of Donald Trump’s earliest supporters in Washington.  In 2018 he included Trump with [[Ronald Reagan , [[Margaret Thatcher , [[John Paul II , and [[Martin Luther King Jr.  as “great champions of freedom.""  === Other controversies === ''Washington Times'' reporters visited imprisoned South African civil rights activist [[Nelson Mandela  during the 1980s. Mandela wrote of them in his autobiography ''Long Walk to Freedom'', ""They seemed less intent on finding out my views than on proving that I was a Communist and a terrorist. All of their questions were slanted in that direction, and when I reiterated that I was neither a Communist nor a terrorist, they attempted to show that I was not a Christian either by asserting that the Reverend [[Martin Luther King  never resorted to violence.""<ref name="":822""/>  In 1988, ''The Washington Times'' published a misleading story suggesting that Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis had sought psychiatric help. ''The Washington Times'' headlined a story, ""Dukakis Kin Hints at Sessions,"" and included a quote from Dukakis' sister-in-law saying ""it is possible"" he visited a psychiatrist. However, ''The Washington Times'' misleadingly clipped the full quote by the sister-in-law, which was ""It's possible, ''but I doubt it''.""<ref name="":18"" />  ''The Washington Times'' reporter Peggy Weyrich quit in 1991 after one of her articles about [[Anita Hill 's testimony in the [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nominee hearings  was rewritten to depict Hill as a ""fantasizer.""<ref name="":822""/>  In a 1997 column for ''The Washington Times'', [[Frank Gaffney  falsely alleged a [[seismic  incident in Russia was a nuclear detonation at that nation's [[Novaya Zemlya  test site, which would have meant that Russia had violated the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty   CTB .<ref name=""bas222""></ref> Subsequent scientific analysis of the Novaya Zemlya event showed that it was a routine [[earthquake . Reporting on the allegation, the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists '' observed that following its publication ""fax machines around Washington, D.C. and across the country poured out pages detailing Russian duplicity. They came from Frank Gaffney."" The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists also noted that during the first four months of 1997 Gaffney had ""issued more than 25 screeds"" against the CTB.<ref name=""bas222"" />  In 2002 ''The Washington Times'' published a story accusing the [[National Educational Association   NEA , the largest teachers' [[Labor union|union  in the United States, of teaching students that the policies of the U.S. government were partly to blame for the [[9/11|2001 terrorist attacks  on the [[World Trade Center  1973–2001 |World Trade Center .<ref name="":83""></ref> The accusation was denied by the NEA.<ref name=""The Boston Globe, 2002-09-022""></ref> Brendan Nyhan  now a [[University of Michigan  political science professor  wrote that ''The Washington Times'' story was a ""lie"" and a ""myth"".<ref name="":83"" />  ==Staff== '''Editors-in-chief'''  *[[James R.

491,Y,therightstuff.biz,"    '''The Right Stuff''' is a [[white nationalist , [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi , [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist  blog and podcast network founded by [[Mike Enoch  that hosts several podcasts, including ''TDS,'' formerly ''The Daily Shoah.''

The website opposes [[miscegenation , along with favoring a return to a form of [[fascism  or [[national socialism  to preserve what they see as [[racial purity  of the [[White people|white race . In the past, the blog has voiced opposition to the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 , preferring for the United States to move to a white-only immigration policy, along with an [[ethnic cleansing , peaceful or otherwise, to make the U.S. a white [[ethnic nationalism|ethnic state . Citing works of literature such as Michael Hoffman's Judaism's Strange Gods and Kevin MacDonald's [[The Culture of Critique series|Culture of Critique Series , the website considers [[The International Jew|Jewish influence  the main reason for [[social liberalism  and decline of the [[Demography of the United States|white population in the United States .

In 2017, however, the newspaper was ranked 355th.  ==History== [[File:TimesOf Buildings.jpg|thumb|left|Times of India Buildings, ca. 1898   ===Beginnings=== ''The Times of India'' issued its first edition on 3 November 1838 as '''''The Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce'''''.<ref name=Britannica></ref><ref name=""televisionpoint2006""></ref>  The paper published Wednesdays and Saturdays under the direction of Raobahadur Narayan Dinanath Velkar, a Maharashtrian Reformist, and contained news from Britain and the world, as well as the [[Indian Subcontinent . J.E. Brennan was its first editor.<ref name=""Parhi2008""></ref><ref name=""Parthasarathy1989""></ref> In 1850, it began to publish daily editions.  In 1860, editor [[Robert Knight  editor |Robert Knight   1825–1892  bought the Indian shareholders' interests, merged with rival ''Bombay Standard'', and started India's first news agency. It wired ''Times'' dispatches to papers across the country and became the Indian agent for [[Reuters  news service. In 1861, he changed the name from the Bombay ''Times and Standard'' to ''The Times of India.'' Knight fought for a press free of prior restraint or intimidation, frequently resisting the attempts by governments, business interests, and cultural spokesmen and led the paper to national prominence.<ref name=""Lalvani2016""></ref> In the 19th century, this newspaper company employed more than 800 people and had a sizeable circulation in India and Europe.  ===Bennett and Coleman ownership=== Subsequently, ''The Times of India'' saw its ownership change several times until 1892 when an English journalist named Thomas Jewell Bennett along with Frank Morris Coleman  who later drowned in the 1915 sinking of the [[SS Persia  1900 |SS ''Persia''   acquired the newspaper through their new joint stock company, ''Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd''.  ===Dalmiya ownership=== Sir [[Stanley Reed  British politician |Stanley Reed  edited ''The Times of India'' from 1907 until 1924 and received correspondence from the major figures of India such as [[Mahatma Gandhi . In all he lived in India for fifty years. He was respected in the United Kingdom as an expert on Indian current affairs. He christened [[Jaipur  as ""the Pink City of India"".  [[The Times Group|Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd  was sold to sugar magnate [[Ramkrishna Dalmia  of the then-famous industrial family, the Dalmiyas, for Rs 20 million in 1946, as India was becoming independent and the British owners were leaving.<ref name=""Kasbekar2006""></ref> In 1955 the [[Vivian Bose  Commission of Inquiry found that Ramkrishna Dalmia, in 1947, had engineered the acquisition of the media giant [[The Times Group|Bennett Coleman & Co.  by transferring money from a bank and an insurance company of which he was the Chairman. In the court case that followed, Ramkrishna Dalmia was sentenced to two years in [[Tihar Jail  after having been convicted of embezzlement and fraud.<ref name=""newyorker""/>  But for most of the jail term he managed to spend in hospital. Upon his release, his son-in-law, [[Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain , to whom he had entrusted the running of [[Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd.  rebuffed his efforts to resume command of the company.<ref name=""newyorker""/>  ===Jain family  Shanti Prasad Jain === In the early 1960s, [[Shanti Prasad Jain  was imprisoned on charges of selling newsprint on the black market.<ref name=""OpIndia.com""></ref> And based on the Vivian Bose Commission's earlier report which found wrongdoings of the Dalmia – Jain group, that included specific charges against [[Shanti Prasad Jain , the [[Government of India  filed a petition to restrain and remove the management of Bennett, Coleman and Company. Based on the pleading, Justice directed the Government to assume control of the newspaper which resulted in replacing half of the directors and appointing a Bombay  now Mumbai  High Court judge as the Chairman.<ref name=""KSage""></ref>  ===Under the Government of India=== [[File:The Times of India 1988 stamp of India.jpg|thumb|''The Times of India'' on a 1988 stamp  [[File:The Times of India 2013 stamp of India.jpg|thumb|''The Times of India'' on a 2013 stamp  Following the Vivian Bose Commission report indicating serious wrongdoings of the Dalmia–Jain group, on 28 August 1969, the Bombay High Court, under Justice J. L. Nain, passed an interim order to disband the existing board of Bennett Coleman and to constitute a new board under the Government. The bench ruled that ""Under these circumstances, the best thing would be to pass such orders on the assumption that the allegations made by the petitioners that the affairs of the company were being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest and to the interests of the Company are correct"".<ref name=""P. Menon Malhan 212""></ref> Following that order, Shanti Prasad Jain ceased to be a director and the company ran with new directors on board, appointed by the Government of India, with the exception of a lone stenographer of the Jains. Curiously, the court appointed [[Nanasaheb Kunte|D K Kunte  as Chairman of the Board. Kunte had no prior business experience and was also an opposition member of the [[Lok Sabha .  ===Back to the Jain family=== In 1976, during the [[Emergency  India |Emergency  in India, the Government transferred ownership of the newspaper back to [[Ashok Kumar Jain   [[Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain 's son, [[Ramkrishna Dalmia 's grandson and the father of [[Samir Jain  and [[Vineet Jain  .<ref name=Caravan></ref> The Jains too often landed themselves in various money laundering scams and [[Ashok Kumar Jain  had to flee the country when the [[Enforcement Directorate  pursued his case strongly in 1998 for alleged violations of illegal transfer of funds  to the tune of US$1.25 million  to an overseas account in [[Switzerland .<ref name=""India Today""></ref><ref name=exp98></ref><ref name=""Mahalingam flonnet&rdurl=fl1515/15151170.htm""></ref><ref name=""Fontline""></ref>  ===During the Emergency=== On 26 June 1975, the day after India declared [[The Emergency  India |a state of emergency , the [[Bombay  edition of ''The Times of India'' carried an entry in its obituary column that read ""D.E.M. O'Cracy, beloved husband of T.Ruth, father of L.I.Bertie, brother of Faith, Hope and Justice expired on 25 June"".<ref name=austing></ref> The move was a critique of Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi 's 21-month state of emergency, which is now widely known as ""the Emergency"" and seen by many as a roundly [[authoritarian  era of Indian government.<ref name=IBN></ref>  === ''The Times'' in the 21st century === In late 2006, Times Group acquired Vijayanand Printers Limited  VPL . VPL previously published two Kannada newspapers, ''Vijay Karnataka'' and ''Usha Kiran'', and an English daily, ''Vijay Times''. ''Vijay Karnataka'' was the leader in the Kannada newspaper segment then.<ref name=VPL></ref>  The paper launched a Chennai edition, 12 April 2008.<ref name=Consolidating></ref>  It launched a Kolhapur edition, February 2013.  ===TOIFA Awards=== Introduced in 2013 and awarded for the second time in 2016, ""[[Times of India Film Awards|The Times of India Film Awards "" or the ""TOIFA"" is an award for the work in Film Industry decided by a global public vote on the nomination categories.  ==Editions and publications== [[File:Times of India Building.jpg|thumb|''TOI''s first office is opposite the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus  in Mumbai where it was founded.<ref name=""televisionpoint2006""/>  ''The Times of India'' is published by the [[Mass media|media group  Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd. The company, along with its other group of companies, known as [[The Times Group , also publishes ''Ahmedabad Mirror''; ''[[Bangalore Mirror ''; ''Bangalore Times'', ''[[Delhi Times ''; ''[[The Economic Times ''; ''ET Panache''  Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru on Monday to Friday, and as ''Times of India ET Panache'' in Pune and Chennai, every Saturday  ''[[Ei Samay '',  a [[Bengali language|Bengali  daily ; the ''[[Maharashtra Times '',  a [[Marathi language|Marathi-language  daily broadsheet ; ''[[Mumbai Mirror ''; the ''[[Navbharat Times '',  a [[Hindi|Hindi-language  daily broadsheet ; and ''Pune Mirror''.

Celebrities can pay for the Times's staff reporters to write positive, promotional articles about them. While these articles are marked ""advertorial"", the newspaper has been criticized for making the alerts small and easy to miss. An internal company report lauded this strategy as “so important that today nearly all Bollywood movie releases pay for promotional coverage ahead of movie releases, and actors/actresses pay to develop their brand through coverage in the paper.”<ref name=""newyorker""/>  Under an ad sales initiative called Medianet, if a large company or Bollywood studio sponsored a news-worthy event, the event would be covered by the Times of India but the name of the company or studio that sponsored it will not be mentioned in the paper unless they paid the Times of India for advertising. In 2010, a report by a subcommittee of India's Press Council found that Medianet's paid news strategy had spread to a large number of newspapers and more than five hundred television channels.<ref name=""newyorker""/>  In 2005, a program called “private treaties” or “brand capital” was introduced under which the Times of India accepts ads in exchange for real-estate ownership or equity in a company.<ref name=""newyorker""/> B.C.C.L. has become one of the largest private equity investors in India with stakes ranging from 1 per cent to 15 per cent across 140 companies. This ads-for-equities model accounts for up to fifteen per cent of its ad revenues and is being followed by other media houses.   Critics have claimed that the company’s paid news and private treaties skew its coverage and shield its newspaper advertisers from scrutiny. [[The Hoot , a media criticism website, has pointed out that when an elevator in a 19 storey luxury apartment complex in Bangalore crashed killing two workers and injuring seven, all the English language and [[Kannada  language newspapers with the exception of the Times of India called out the name of the construction company, Sobha Developers, which was a private-treaty partner. An article titled “reaping gold through bt cotton,” which first appeared in the Nagpur edition of the Times of India in 2008, reappeared unchanged in 2011, this time with a small print alert that the article was a ""marketing feature"". In both times the article was factually incorrect and made false claims about the success of [[Monsanto 's genetically modified cotton. In 2005, when the [[Honda  Motors plant in Gurgaon experienced an eight-month-long conflict between management and non-unionized workers over wages and work conditions, provoking violence and charges of police brutality, the Times of India covered the concerns of Honda and the harm done to India’s investment climate and largely ignored the issues raised by workers.<ref name=""newyorker""/>  [[Vineet Jain , Managing Director of B.C.C.L., has insisted that a wall does exist between sales and the newsroom, and that the paper does not give favorable coverage to the company’s business partners. “Our editors don’t know who we have,” Jain said, although he later acknowledged that all private-treaty clients are listed on the company’s Web site.<ref name=""newyorker""/> Ravindra Dhariwal, the CEO of B.C.C.L. has defended private treaties in a 2010 interview with the magazine ''[[Outlook  magazine |Outlook '' and claims that the partners in the private treaties sign contracts where they agree to clauses that they will not receive any favorable editorial coverage.  ===Anti Competitive Behavior=== There have been claims that The Times of India would strike deals with advertisers only if they removed their advertisements from other competitor newspapers.<ref name=""newyorker""/>  The Times of India is also embroiled in an active lawsuit against [[the Financial Times . In 1993, when the Financial times was preparing to enter the Indian market, [[Samir Jain  the Vice-Chairman of B.C.C.L. registered the term ""Financial Times"" as a trademark of his company and declared it his intellectual property in an attempt to stymie the Financial Times and prevent them from competing with [[the Economic Times  which is owned by B.C.C.L.<ref name=""newyorker""/>  In 1994, when [[the Hindustan Times  was the top-selling paper in New Delhi, the Times of India slashed their prices by a third, to one and a half rupees after having built up their ads sales force in preparation for the price drop to make up for the lost circulation revenue. By 1998, [[the Hindustan Times  had dropped to second place in Delhi. The Times of India took a similar strategy in Bangalore where they dropped the price to one rupee despite protests from [[Siddharth Varadarajan , one of the editors of the newspaper at the time, who called the strategy ""predatory pricing"".<ref name=""newyorker""/>  ===Cobrapost=== In 2018, [[Vineet Jain , Managing Director of B.C.C.L., and Sanjeev Shah, executive president of B.C.C.L., were caught on camera as part of an undercover sting operation by Cobrapost agreeing to promote Hindutva content through the group’s many media properties for a proposed spend of ₹500 crore, some of which the client said could only be paid with black money. B.C.C.L. has responded to the sting claiming that the video that was released by Cobrapost was incomplete and doctored and that Vineet Jain was engaged in a counter-sting of his own to expose the undercover reporter during the filming of the video.  ==Notable employees== * [[Sham Lal , Editor and Scholar * [[Samir Jain , Vice-Chairman & Publisher * [[Vineet Jain , MD,  * [[Jug Suraiya   associate editor, columnist, ""Jugular Vein,"" [[cartoonist , ''Dubyaman II''  * [[Swaminathan Aiyar   columnist, ""Swaminomics""  * [[R.

However, in the late 1990s, it expanded its coverage to all of South Florida, including [[Miami-Dade County|Miami-Dade  and [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach  counties, in the late 1990s. In the former area, ''[[The Miami Herald '' is its primary competition, while in the latter area, ''[[The Palm Beach Post '' is the chief competition.

It also publishes a Spanish-language weekly, El Sentinel, as well as various community publications.  ==History== The ''Sun-Sentinel'' traces its history to the 1910 founding of the ''Fort Lauderdale Weekly Herald'', the first known newspaper in the Fort Lauderdale area, and the ''Everglades Breeze'', a locally printed paper founded in 1911, which promoted itself as ""Florida's great Farm, Truck and Fruit Growing paper."" In 1925, the ''Everglades Breeze'' was renamed the ''Sentinel''.  That same year, two Ohio publishers bought both the ''Sentinel'' and the ''Herald'', consolidating the newspapers into a daily publication called the ''Daily News and Evening Sentinel''.<ref name=sunsenthist></ref> In 1926, Horace and Tom Stillwell purchased the paper. However, the devastation wrought by the [[1926 Miami hurricane  caused circulation to drop and, in 1929, Tom Stillwell sold the paper to the Gore Publishing Company, headed by R.H. Gore, Sr. By 1945, circulation of the ''Daily News and Evening Sentinel'' had climbed to 10,000.  In 1953, Gore Publishing changed the name of the paper to the ''Fort Lauderdale News'' and added a Sunday morning edition. In 1960, when the paper had a circulation of 60,000, Gore Publishing purchased the weekly ''Pompano Beach Sun'' and expanded it into a six-day morning paper, the ''Pompano Sun-Sentinel''—thus reviving the ""Sentinel"" name it had discarded seven years earlier. In 1963, the [[Tribune Company  acquired Gore Publishing. In the 1970s, the morning paper changed its name to the ''Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel''. In 1982, the two papers merged their editorial staffs. The two papers then merged into a single morning paper under the '''''Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel''''' name.  In 2000, after expanding its coverage, the paper changed its name to the '''''South Florida Sun-Sentinel'''''.  In 2001, the ''Sun-Sentinel'' opened a full-time [[foreign bureau  in [[Havana, Cuba . Shared with the Tribune Co., their [[Havana  newsroom was the only permanent presence of any South Florida newspaper at the time.  In 2002, the ''Sun-Sentinel'' began publishing a Spanish weekly newspaper, ''El Sentinel.'' The newspaper is distributed free on Saturdays to Hispanic households in Broward and Palm Beach counties and is also available in racks in both counties. It is also available online at Elsentinel.com.  In 2004, the paper won the [[Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism  for its coverage of health and human services in the state.  On August 17, 2008, the ''Sun-Sentinel'' unveiled a redesigned layout, with larger graphics, more color, and a new large ""S"" logo. This is in tune with another Tribune newspaper  ''[[Orlando Sentinel '' , which redesigned its newspaper a few months previously, and created a brand synergy with Tribune sister operation and [[The CW Television Network|CW  affiliate [[WSFL-TV   Channel 39 , which relocated its operations to the ''Sun-Sentinel'' offices in 2008 and adopted a logo matching the capital ""S"" in the new logo.  Since 2011 to present day, the newspaper made significant updates to meld print media with modern media. These advances include: launching the pure-play entertainment website SouthFlorida.com and starting a video channel called ''SunSentinel Originals''. As a result of their media integration, the newspaper was named one of ''Editor & Publisher'''s ""10 Newspapers That Do it Right"".<ref name=""EP10""></ref>  ==Awards== The ''Sun-Sentinel'' gives annual awards to area businesses and business leaders, including Top Workplaces for People on the Move, Excalibur Award and others.

Founded as a weekly review of politics and literature on 12 April 1913, it was connected then with [[Sidney Webb|Sidney  and [[Beatrice Webb  and other leading members of the [[socialist  [[Fabian Society , such as [[George Bernard Shaw  who was a founding director. They had supported ''[[The New Age '', a journal edited by [[A. R. Orage , but by 1912 that journal moved away editorially from supporting Fabian politics and [[women's suffrage .  Today, the magazine is a print-digital hybrid. According to its present self-description, it has a [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|liberal , sceptical, political position.  The magazine was founded in 1913 by members of the [[Fabian Society  as a weekly review of politics and literature. The longest-serving editor was [[Kingsley Martin   1930–1960 , and the current editor is [[Jason Cowley , who assumed the post in 2008. The magazine has notably recognized and published new writers and critics, as well as encouraged major careers.  Its contributors have included [[John Maynard Keynes , [[Bertrand Russell , [[Virginia Woolf , [[Christopher Hitchens , and [[Paul Johnson  writer |Paul Johnson .  Historically, the magazine was affectionately referred to as ""The Staggers"" because of crises in funding, ownership, and circulation. The nickname is now used as the title of its politics blog.    Circulation was at its highest in the 1960s but has surged again in recent years. In 2016, the certified average [[Magazine circulation|circulation  was 34,025. Traffic to the magazine's website that year reached a new high with 27 million [[page view s and four million unique users. Associated websites are CityMetric, Spotlight and NewStatesman Tech. In 2018, New Statesman America was launched.   ==Early years== [[File:New-Statesman-First-Issue-12-April-1913.jpg|thumb|The first issue of the ''New Statesman'', 12 April 1913  The ''New Statesman'' was founded in 1913 by [[Sidney Webb|Sidney  and [[Beatrice Webb  with the support of [[George Bernard Shaw  and other prominent members of the [[Fabian Society . The Fabians previously had supported ''[[The New Age '' but that journal by 1912 had moved away from supporting Fabian politics and issues such as [[women's suffrage . The first editor of the ''New Statesman'' was [[Clifford Sharp , who remained editor until 1928. [[Desmond MacCarthy  joined the paper in 1913 and became literary editor, recruiting [[Cyril Connolly  to the staff in 1928. J.C. Squire edited the magazine when Sharp was on wartime duties during the [[First World War .  In November 1914, three months after the beginning of the war, the ''New Statesmen'' published a lengthy anti-war supplement by Shaw, ""Common Sense About The War"", a scathing dissection of its causes, which castigated all nations involved but particularly savaged the British. It sold a phenomenal 75,000 copies by the end of the year and created an international sensation. ''[[The New York Times '' reprinted it as America began its lengthy debate on entering what was then called ""the European War"".  During Sharp's last two years in the post, from around 1926, he was debilitated by chronic [[alcoholism  and the paper was actually edited by his deputy [[Charles Mostyn Lloyd . Although the Webbs and most Fabians were closely associated with the [[Labour Party  UK |Labour Party , Sharp was drawn increasingly to the [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith  [[Liberal Party  UK |Liberals .  Lloyd stood in after Sharp's departure until the appointment of Kingsley Martin as editor in 1930 – a position Martin was to hold for 30 years.  ==1931–1960: Kingsley Martin== In 1931 the ''New Statesman'' merged with the Liberal weekly ''[[The Nation and Athenaeum '' and changed its name to the ''New Statesman and Nation'', which it kept until 1964. The chairman of ''The Nation and Athenaeum''s board was the economist [[John Maynard Keynes , who came to be an important influence on the newly merged paper, which started with a circulation of just under 13,000. It also absorbed ''The Week-end Review'' in 1934  one element of which survives in the shape of the ''New Statesman''s Weekly Competition, and the other the 'This England' feature . The Competition feature, in which readers submitted jokes and often parodies and pastiches of the work of famous authors, became one of the most famous parts of the magazine.<ref name=""A competition!""></ref> Most famously, [[Graham Greene  won second prize in a challenge to parody his own work.  During the 1930s, Martin's ''New Statesman'' moved markedly to the left politically. It became strongly anti-[[fascist  and [[pacifist , opposing British rearmament. After the 1938 ''[[Anschluss '', Martin wrote: ""Today if [[Neville Chamberlain|Mr. Chamberlain  would come forward and tell us that his policy was really one not only of isolation but also of [[Little Englander|Little Englandism  in which the [[British Empire|Empire  was to be given up because it could not be defended and in which military defence was to be abandoned because war would totally end civilization, we for our part would wholeheartedly support him.""  The magazine provoked further controversy with its coverage of [[Joseph Stalin 's [[Soviet Union . In 1932, Keynes reviewed Martin's book on the Soviet Union, ''Low's Russian Sketchbook''. Keynes argued that Martin was 'a little too full perhaps of good will' towards Stalin, and that any doubts about Stalin's rule had 'been swallowed down if possible'.<ref name=""mt""></ref> Martin was irritated by Keynes's article but still allowed it to be printed.<ref name=""mt""/> In a 17 September 1932 editorial, the magazine accused the British [[Conservative Party  UK |Conservative  press of misrepresenting the Soviet Union's agricultural policy but added that ""the serious nature of the food situation is no secret and no invention"". The magazine defended the Soviet [[Collective farming#Communist collectivization|collectivization  policy, but also said the policy had 'proceeded far too quickly and lost the cooperation of farmers'. In 1934 it ran an interview with Stalin by [[H. G. Wells . Although sympathetic to aspects of the Soviet Union, Wells disagreed with Stalin on several issues.<ref name=""mt""/> The debate resulted in several more articles in the magazine; in one of them, [[George Bernard Shaw  accused Wells of being disrespectful to Stalin during the interview.<ref name=""mt""/>  In 1938 came Martin's refusal to publish [[George Orwell 's celebrated dispatches from Barcelona during the [[Spanish civil war  because they criticised the communists for suppressing the [[anarchist s and the left-wing Workers' Party of Marxist Unification  [[POUM  . 'It is an unfortunate fact,' Martin wrote to Orwell, 'that any hostile criticism of the present Russian regime is liable to be taken as propaganda ''against socialism''. Martin also refused to allow any of the magazine's writers to review [[Leon Trotsky 's anti-Stalinist book ''[[The Revolution Betrayed ''.  Martin became more critical of Stalin after the [[Hitler-Stalin pact , claiming Stalin was 'adopting the familiar technique of the Fuhrer' and adding, 'Like Hitler, he [Stalin] has a contempt for all arguments except that of superior force.' The magazine also condemned the [[Winter War|Soviet Invasion of Finland .  Circulation grew enormously under Martin's editorship, reaching 70,000 by the end of the Second World War. This number helped the magazine become a key player in Labour politics. The paper welcomed Labour's [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election  victory but took a critical line on the new government's foreign policy. The young Labour [[Member of parliament|MP  [[Richard Crossman , who had been an assistant editor for the magazine before the war, was Martin's chief lieutenant in this period, and the ''Statesman'' published ''[[Keep Left  pamphlet |Keep Left '', the pamphlet written by Crossman, [[Michael Foot  and [[Ian Mikardo , that most succinctly laid out the Labour left's proposals for a ""third force"" foreign policy rather than alliance with the United States.  During the 1950s, the ''New Statesman'' remained a left critic of British foreign and defence policy and of the Labour leadership of [[Hugh Gaitskell , although Martin never got on personally with [[Aneurin Bevan , the leader of the anti-[[Gaitskellism|Gaitskellite  Labour faction. The magazine opposed the [[Korean War , and an article by [[J. B. Priestley  directly led to the founding of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament .  There was much less focus on a single political line in the back part of the paper, which was devoted to book reviews and articles on cultural topics. Indeed, with these pages managed by [[Janet Adam Smith , who was literary editor from 1952 to 1960, the paper was sometimes described as a [[pantomime horse : its back half was required reading even for many who disagreed with the paper's politics. This tradition would continue into the 1960s with [[Karl Miller  as Smith's replacement.  ==After Kingsley Martin== Martin retired in 1960 and was replaced as editor by [[John Freeman  British politician |John Freeman , a politician and journalist who had resigned from the Labour government in 1951 with Bevan and [[Harold Wilson . Freeman left in 1965 and was followed in the chair by [[Paul Johnson  writer |Paul Johnson , then on the left, under whose editorship the ''Statesman'' reached its highest ever circulation. For some, even enemies of Johnson such as [[Richard Ingrams , this was a strong period for the magazine editorially.  After Johnson's departure in 1970, the ''Statesman'' went into a long period of declining circulation under successive editors: [[Richard Crossman   1970–72 , who tried to edit it at the same time as playing a major role in Labour politics; [[Anthony Howard  journalist |Anthony Howard   1972–78 , whose recruits to the paper included [[Christopher Hitchens , [[Martin Amis  and [[James Fenton   surprisingly, the arch anti-Socialist [[Auberon Waugh  was writing for the ''Statesman'' at this time before returning to ''[[The Spectator '' ; Bruce Page  1978–82 , who moved the paper towards specialising in investigative journalism, sacking [[Arthur Marshall  broadcaster |Arthur Marshall , who had been writing for the ''Statesman'' on and off since 1935, as a columnist, allegedly because of the latter's support for [[Margaret Thatcher ; [[Hugh Stephenson  UK journalist |Hugh Stephenson   1982–86 , under whom it took a strong position again for [[unilateral nuclear disarmament ; [[John Lloyd  journalist |John Lloyd   1986–87 , who swung the paper's politics back to the centre; [[Stuart Weir  UK journalist |Stuart Weir   1987–90 , under whose editorship the  ''Statesman'' founded the [[Charter 88  constitutional reform pressure group; and [[Steve Platt  UK journalist |Steve Platt   1990–96 .  The ''Statesman'' acquired the weekly ''[[New Society  magazine |New Society '' in 1988 and merged with it, becoming ''New Statesman and Society'' for the next eight years, then reverting to the old title, having meanwhile absorbed ''[[Marxism Today '' in 1991. In 1993, the ''Statesman'' was sued by Prime Minister [[John Major  after it published an article discussing rumours that Major was having an extramarital affair with a Downing Street caterer. Although the action was settled out of court for a minimal sum, the magazine's legal costs almost led to its closure.  In 1994, KGB defector [[Yuri Shvets  said that the [[KGB  utilised the ''New Statesman'' to spread disinformation. Shvets said that the KGB had provided disinformation, including forged documents, to the ''New Statesman'' journalist Claudia Wright which she used for anti-American and anti-Israel stories in line with the KGB's campaigns. By 1996 the magazine was selling 23,000 copies a week. ''New Statesman'' was the first periodical to go online, hosted by the www.cleanroom.co.uk, in 1995.  ==Since 1996== The ''New Statesman'' was rescued from near-bankruptcy by a takeover by businessman Philip Jeffrey but in 1996, after prolonged boardroom wrangling over Jeffrey's plans, it was sold to [[Geoffrey Robinson , the Labour MP and businessman. Following [[Steve Platt 's resignation, Robinson appointed a former editor of ''[[The Independent '' , [[Ian Hargreaves , on what was at the time an unprecedentedly high salary. Hargreaves fired most of the left-wingers on the staff and turned the ''Statesman'' into a strong supporter of [[Tony Blair  being Labour's leader.<ref name=guardian-20050912/>  Hargreaves was succeeded by [[Peter Wilby , also from the ''Independent'' stable, who had previously been the ''Statesman''′s books editor, in 1998.  Wilby attempted to reposition the paper back ""on the left"". His stewardship was not without controversy. In 2002, for example, the periodical was accused of [[antisemitism  when it published an investigative cover story on the power of the ""Zionist lobby"" in Britain, under the title ""A Kosher Conspiracy?"". The cover was illustrated with a gold Star of David resting on a Union Jack. Wilby responded to the criticisms in a subsequent issue. During Wilby's relatively long tenure of seven years, the ''New Statesman'' moved from making a financial loss to having a good operating profit, though circulation only remained steady at around 23,000.<ref name=guardian-20050912></ref>  [[John Kampfner , Wilby's political editor, succeeded him as editor in May 2005 following considerable internal lobbying. Under Kampfner's editorship, a relaunch in 2006 initially saw headline circulation climb to over 30,000. However, over 5,000 of these were apparently monitored free copies, and Kampfner failed to maintain the 30,000 circulation he had pledged. In February 2008, Audit Bureau Circulation figures showed that circulation had plunged nearly 13% in 2007. Kampfner resigned on 13 February 2008, the day before the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations  UK |ABC figures  were made public, reportedly due to conflicts with Robinson over the magazine's marketing budget  which Robinson had apparently slashed in reaction to the fall in circulation .  In April 2008 [[Geoffrey Robinson  sold a 50% interest in the magazine to businessman Mike Danson, and the remainder a year later. The appointment of the new editor [[Jason Cowley  was announced on 16 May 2008 but he did not take up the job until the end of September 2008.  In January 2009, the magazine refused to recognise the [[National Union of Journalists , the trade union to which almost of all its journalists belonged, though further discussions were promised but never materialised.  In 2009, Cowley was named current-affairs editor of the year at the British Society of Magazine Editors awards and in 2011, he was named editor of the year in the Newspaper & Current Affairs Magazine Category at the British Society of Magazine Editors awards, while Jon Bernstein, the deputy editor, gained the award for Consumer Website Editor of the Year. Cowley had been shortlisted as Editor of the Year  consumer magazines  in the 2012 PPA  [[Professional Publishers Association   Awards. He was also shortlisted for the European Press Prize editing award in January 2013, when the awards committee said: ""Cowley has succeeded in revitalising the New Statesman and re-establishing its position as an influential political and cultural weekly. He has given the New Statesman an edge and a relevance to current affairs it hasn’t had for years.""  In April 2013 the magazine published a 186-page centenary special, the largest single issue in its history.  It also published two special editions  250 and 150 pages  showcasing 100 years of the best and boldest journalism from its archives.The following year it expanded its web presence by establishing two new websites: May2015.com, a polling data site focused on the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election , and CityMetric, a cities magazine site under the tagline, ""Urbanism for the social media age"" and edited by Jonn Elledge, King of the Numtots.  In December 2016, it was announced that the Weekend Competition, a feature inherited from ''The Week-end Review'', would be discontinued, for reasons of space.  As of 2017 the ''New Statesman'' considers itself a ""print-digital hybrid"" with peak online traffic of over 4 million unique visitors per month, almost a four-fold increase since 2011. This compares to the magazine circulation of 34,000.<ref name=thedrum-20170223></ref>  At the 2017 British Society of Magazine Editors  BSME  awards, editor Jason Cowley was named Current Affairs and Politics editor of the year for the third time, defeating rivals from ''[[The Spectator '', ''[[The Economist '' and ''[[Prospect  magazine |Prospect ''. ""The winning title is consistently fresh and thought provoking. In a very strong category it stood out for its eloquence and independent views,"" the BSME judges said, on presenting the award.<ref name=""New Statesman""></ref>  The magazine's Spotlight series  which publishes specialist business content  also won the Launch of the Year award, with judges describing the supplements as a ""great example of monetising a brand without losing its integrity"".<ref name=""New Statesman""/>  ==Guest editors== In March 2009 the magazine had its first guest editor, [[Alastair Campbell , the former head of communications for [[Tony Blair . Campbell chose to feature his partner [[Fiona Millar , Tony Blair  in an article ""Why we must all do God"" , football manager [[Alex Ferguson , and [[Sarah Jane Brown|Sarah Brown , the wife of Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown . This editorship was condemned by [[Suzanne Moore , a contributor to the magazine for twenty years. She wrote in a ''[[Mail on Sunday '' article: ""''New Statesman'' fiercely opposed the Iraq war and yet now hands over the reins to someone key in orchestrating that conflict"". Campbell responded: ""I had no idea she worked for the ''New Statesman''. I don't read the ''Mail on Sunday''. But professing commitment to leftwing values in that rightwing rag lends a somewhat weakened credibility to anything she says.""  In September 2009 the magazine was guest-edited by Labour politician [[Ken Livingstone , the former mayor of London.  In October 2010 the magazine was guest-edited by the British author and broadcaster [[Melvyn Bragg . The issue included a previously unpublished poem by [[Ted Hughes , ""Last letter"", describing what happened during the three days leading up to the suicide of his first wife, the poet [[Sylvia Plath . Its first line is: ""What happened that night? Your final night.""—and the poem ends with the moment Hughes is informed of his wife's death.  In April 2011 the magazine was guest-edited by the human rights activist [[Jemima Khan . The issue featured a series of exclusives including the actor [[Hugh Grant 's secret recording of former ''[[News of the World '' journalist [[Paul McMullan  journalist |Paul McMullan , and a much-commented-on interview with Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg , in which Clegg admitted that he ""cries regularly to music"" and that his nine-year-old son asked him, ""'Why are the students angry with you, Papa?'""  In June 2011 [[Rowan Williams , [[Archbishop of Canterbury  created a furore as guest editor by claiming that the Coalition government had introduced ""radical, long term policies for which no one had voted"" and in doing so had created ""anxiety and anger"" among many in the country. He was accused of being highly partisan, notwithstanding his having invited [[Iain Duncan Smith , the Work and Pensions Secretary to write an article and having interviewed the Foreign Secretary [[William Hague  in the same edition. He also noted that the Labour Party had failed to offer an alternative to what he called ""associational socialism"". The ''Statesman'' promoted the edition on the basis of Williams' alleged attack on the government, whereas Williams himself had ended his article by asking for ""a democracy capable of real argument about shared needs and hopes and real generosity"".  In December 2011 the magazine was guest-edited by [[Richard Dawkins . The issue included the writer [[Christopher Hitchens 's final interview, conducted by Dawkins in Texas, and pieces by [[Bill Gates , [[Sam Harris  author |Sam Harris , [[Daniel Dennett  and [[Philip Pullman .  In October 2012 the magazine was guest-edited by Chinese dissident artist [[Ai Weiwei  and, for the first time, published simultaneously in Mandarin  in digital form  and English. To evade China's internet censors, the ''New Statesman'' uploaded the issue to file-sharing sites such as [[BitTorrent . As well as writing that week's editorial, Ai Weiwei interviewed the Chinese civil rights activist [[Chen Guangcheng , who fled to the United States after exposing the use of compulsory abortions and sterilisations. The issue was launched on 19 October 2012 at The [[Lisson Gallery  in London, where speakers including artist [[Anish Kapoor  and lawyer [[Mark Stephens  solicitor |Mark Stephens  paid tribute to Ai Weiwei.  In October 2013 the magazine was guest-edited by [[Russell Brand , with contributions from [[David Lynch , [[Noel Gallagher , [[Naomi Klein , [[Rupert Everett , [[Amanda Palmer , and [[Alec Baldwin , as well as an essay by Brand.  In October 2014, the magazine was guest-edited by the artist [[Grayson Perry , whose essay titled ""Default Man"" was widely discussed.  The former British prime minister [[Gordon Brown  guest-edited the magazine in 2016, a special edition exploring [[Britain's relationship with Europe  ahead of the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|EU referendum .  Contributors to the issue included the Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen  and [[Michael Sandel .  ==List of editors== {|width=100% |- valign=top |width=50%| *[[Clifford Sharp   1913–28  *[[Charles Mostyn Lloyd   1928–31  *[[Kingsley Martin   1931–60  *[[John Freeman  British politician |John Freeman   1961–65  *[[Paul Johnson  writer |Paul Johnson   1965–70  *[[Richard Crossman   1970–72  *[[Anthony Howard  journalist |Anthony Howard   1972–78  *[[Bruce Page  UK journalist |Bruce Page   1978–82  *[[Hugh Stephenson  UK journalist |Hugh Stephenson   1982–86  |width=50%| *[[John Lloyd  journalist |John Lloyd   1986–87  *[[Stuart Weir  UK journalist |Stuart Weir   1987–91  *[[Steve Platt   1991–96  *[[Ian Hargreaves   1996–98  *[[Peter Wilby   1998–2005  *[[John Kampfner   2005–08  *[[Sue Matthias   acting editor 2008  *[[Jason Cowley   2008–  |}  ==See also== * [[Denis Pitts  * [[G.

Founded as a weekly review of politics and literature on 12 April 1913, it was connected then with Sidney and Beatrice Webb and other leading members of the socialist Fabian Society, such as George Bernard Shaw who was a founding director. They had supported The New Age, a journal edited by A. R. Orage, but by 1912 that journal moved away editorially from supporting Fabian politics and women's suffrage. Today, the magazine is a print-digital hybrid. According to its present self-description, it has a liberal, sceptical, political position.The magazine was founded in 1913 by members of the Fabian Society as a weekly review of politics and literature. The longest-serving editor was Kingsley Martin  1930–1960 , and the current editor is Jason Cowley, who assumed the post in 2008. The magazine has notably recognized and published new writers and critics, as well as encouraged major careers.  Its contributors have included John Maynard Keynes, Bertrand Russell, Virginia Woolf, Christopher Hitchens, and Paul Johnson. Historically, the magazine was affectionately referred to as ""The Staggers"" because of crises in funding, ownership, and circulation. The nickname is now used as the title of its politics blog.Circulation was at its highest in the 1960s but has surged again in recent years. In 2016, the certified average circulation was 34,025. Traffic to the magazine's website that year reached a new high with 27 million page views and four million unique users. Associated websites are CityMetric, Spotlight and NewStatesman Tech. In 2018, New Statesman America was launched."

The ''Journal'', along with its [[The Wall Street Journal Asia|Asian  and [[The Wall Street Journal Europe|European  editions, is published six days a week by [[Dow Jones & Company , a division of [[News Corp . The newspaper is published in the [[broadsheet  format and online. The ''Journal'' has been printed continuously since its inception on July 8, 1889, by [[Charles Dow , [[Edward Jones  statistician |Edward Jones , and [[Charles Bergstresser .  ''The Wall Street Journal'' is one of the largest [[List of newspapers in the United States by circulation|newspapers in the United States by circulation , with a circulation of about 2.475million copies  including nearly 1,590,000 digital subscriptions  ,<ref name=""circ-june2018""/> compared with ''[[USA Today ''s 1.7million. The ''Journal'' publishes the luxury news and lifestyle magazine ''[[WSJ.|WSJ ,'' which was originally launched as a quarterly but expanded to 12 issues as of 2014. An online version was launched in 1996, which has been accessible only to subscribers since it began.   The newspaper is notable for its award-winning news coverage, and has won 37 [[Pulitzer Prize s  as of 2017 . The editorial pages of the ''Journal'' are typically conservative in their position. The <nowiki>''</nowiki>Journal<nowiki>''</nowiki> editorial board has promoted fringe views on the science of climate change, acid rain, and ozone depletion, as well as on the health harms of second-hand smoke, pesticides and asbestos.   ==History==  ===Beginnings=== [[File:The Wall Street Journal first issue.jpg|thumb|left|Front page of the first issue of ''The Wall Street Journal'', July 8, 1889   The first products of Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of the ''Journal'', were brief news bulletins, nicknamed ""flimsies"", hand-delivered throughout the day to traders at the [[stock exchange  in the early 1880s. They were later aggregated in a printed daily summary called the ''Customers' Afternoon Letter''. Reporters Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser converted this into ''The Wall Street Journal'', which was published for the first time on July 8, 1889, and began delivery of the Dow Jones News Service via telegraph. In 1896, The ""[[Dow Jones Industrial Average "" was officially launched. It was the first of several indices of stock and bond prices on the [[New York Stock Exchange . In 1899, the ''Journal'' Review & Outlook column, which still runs today, appeared for the first time, initially written by Charles Dow.  Journalist [[Clarence Barron  purchased control of the company for US$130,000 in 1902; circulation was then around 7,000 but climbed to 50,000 by the end of the 1920s. Barron and his predecessors were credited with creating an atmosphere of fearless, independent financial reporting—a novelty in the early days of [[business journalism . In 1921, [[Barron's  newspaper |Barron's , the United States's premier financial weekly, was founded.<ref name=""Crossen"">Crossen, Cynthia.

B1, August 1, 2007.</ref> Barron died in 1928, a year before [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Black Tuesday , the stock market crash that greatly affected the [[Great Depression  in the United States. Barron's descendants, the [[Bancroft family , would continue to control the company until 2007.<ref name=""Crossen""/>  The ''Journal'' took its modern shape and prominence in the 1940s, a time of industrial expansion for the United States and its financial institutions in New York. [[Bernard Kilgore  was named managing editor of the paper in 1941, and company CEO in 1945, eventually compiling a 25-year career as the head of the ''Journal''. Kilgore was the architect of the paper's iconic front-page design, with its ""What's News"" digest, and its national distribution strategy, which brought the paper's circulation from 33,000 in 1941 to 1.1million at the time of Kilgore's death in 1967. Under Kilgore, in [[1947 Pulitzer Prize|1947 , the paper won its first [[Pulitzer Prize  for William Henry Grimes's [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing|editorials .<ref name=""Crossen""/>  In 1967, Dow Jones Newswires began a major expansion outside of the United States that ultimately put journalists in every major financial center in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, and Africa. In 1970, Dow Jones bought the Ottaway newspaper chain, which at the time comprised nine dailies and three Sunday newspapers. Later, the name was changed to ""Dow Jones Local Media Group"".  1971 to 1997 brought about a series of launches, acquisitions, and joint ventures, including ""[[Factiva "", ''[[The Wall Street Journal Asia '', ''[[The Wall Street Journal Europe '', the WSJ.com website, Dow Jones Indexes, [[MarketWatch , and ""WSJ Weekend Edition"". In 2007, [[News Corp.  acquired Dow Jones. ''[[WSJ. '', a luxury lifestyle magazine, was launched in 2008.  ===Internet expansion===  A complement to the print newspaper, ''The Wall Street Journal Online'', was launched in 1996 and has allowed access only by subscription from the beginning. In 2003, Dow Jones began to integrate reporting of the ''Journal'' print and online subscribers together in [[Audit Bureau of Circulations  North America |Audit Bureau of Circulations  statements. In 2007, it was commonly believed to be the largest paid-subscription news site on the Web, with 980,000 paid subscribers.<ref name=""Crossen""/> Since then, online subscribership has fallen, due in part to rising subscription costs, and was reported at 400,000 in March 2010.<ref name=""Plambeck""></ref> In May 2008, an annual subscription to the online edition of ''The Wall Street Journal'' cost $119 for those who do not have subscriptions to the print edition. By June 2013, the monthly cost for a subscription to the online edition was $22.99, or $275.88 annually, excluding introductory offers.  [[File:Vladimir Putin 11 February 2002-1.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Putin  with ''Journal'' correspondent [[Karen Elliott House  in 2002   On November 30, 2004, [[Oasys Mobile  and ''The Wall Street Journal'' released an app that would allow users to access content from the ''Wall Street Journal Online'' via their mobile phones.  Many of ''The Wall Street Journal'' news stories are available through free online newspapers that subscribe to the Dow Jones [[syndicate . Pulitzer Prize–winning stories from 1995 are available free on the Pulitzer web site.  In September 2005, the ''Journal'' launched a weekend edition, delivered to all subscribers, which marked a return to Saturday publication after a lapse of some 50 years. The move was designed in part to attract more consumer advertising.<ref name=""Crossen""/>  In 2005, the ''Journal'' reported a readership profile of about 60 percent top management, an average income of $191,000, an average household net worth of $2.1million, and an average age of 55.  In 2007, the ''Journal'' launched a worldwide expansion of its website to include major foreign-language editions. The paper had also shown an interest in buying the rival ''[[Financial Times ''.<ref name=""guardian1""></ref>  ===Design changes=== The nameplate is unique in having a period at the end.  On September 5, 2006, the ''Journal'' included advertising on its front page for the first time. This followed the introduction of front-page advertising on the European and Asian editions in late 2005.  After presenting nearly identical front-page layouts for half a century—always six columns, with the day's top stories in the first and sixth columns, ""What's News"" digest in the second and third, the ""A-hed"" feature story in the fourth  with 'hed' being jargon for [[headline   and themed weekly reports in the fifth column – the paper in 2007 decreased its [[broadsheet  width from 15 to 12inches while keeping the length at 22inches, to save [[newsprint  costs. News design consultant [[Mario García  designer |Mario Garcia  collaborated on the changes. Dow Jones said it would save US$18million a year in newsprint costs across all ''The Wall Street Journal'' papers. This move eliminated one column of print, pushing the ""A-hed"" out of its traditional location  though the paper now usually includes a quirky feature story on the right side of the front page, sandwiched among the lead stories .  The paper still uses ink dot drawings called [[hedcut s, introduced in 1979 and originally created by [[Kevin Sprouls , in addition to photographs, a method of illustration considered a consistent visual signature of the paper. The ''Journal'' still heavily employs the use of [[caricatures , notably those of [[Ken Fallin , such as when [[Peggy Noonan  memorialized then-recently deceased newsman [[Tim Russert .<ref name=Biz>[http://www.bizbash.com/orlando/content/editorial/12186_caricaturist_captures_the_corporate_market.php Caricaturist Captures the Corporate Market] , Biz Bash Orlando, August 11, 2008.</ref> The use of color photographs and graphics has become increasingly common in recent years with the addition of more ""lifestyle"" sections.  The daily was awarded by the [[Society for News Design  World's Best Designed Newspaper award for 1994 and 1997.  ===News Corporation and News Corp=== On May 2, 2007, [[News Corporation  made an unsolicited takeover bid for Dow Jones, offering US$60 a share for stock that had been selling for US$33 a share. The [[Bancroft family , which controlled more than 60% of the voting stock, at first rejected the offer, but later reconsidered its position.  Three months later, on August 1, 2007, News Corporation and Dow Jones entered into a definitive merger agreement. The US$5billion sale added ''The Wall Street Journal'' to [[Rupert Murdoch 's news empire, which already included [[Fox News Channel , [[Fox Business Network|financial network unit  and London's ''[[The Times '', and locally within New York, the ''[[New York Post '', along with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox  [[flagship station  [[WNYW   Channel 5  and [[MyNetworkTV  flagship [[WWOR-TV|WWOR   Channel 9 .  On December 13, 2007, shareholders representing more than 60 percent of Dow Jones's voting stock approved the company's acquisition by News Corporation.  In an editorial page column, publisher [[L.&nbsp;Gordon Crovitz  said the Bancrofts and News Corporation had agreed that the ''Journal''s news and opinion sections would preserve their editorial independence from their new corporate parent:<ref name=""Crovitz"">[[L.&nbsp;Gordon Crovitz , ""A Report to Our Readers"". ''The Wall Street Journal''  New York , page A14, August 1, 2007.</ref>  A special committee was established to oversee the paper's editorial integrity. When the managing editor [[Marcus Brauchli  resigned on April 22, 2008, the committee said that News Corporation had violated its agreement by not notifying the committee earlier. However, Brauchli said he believed that new owners should appoint their own editor.  A 2007 ''Journal'' article quoted charges that Murdoch had made and broken similar promises in the past. One large shareholder commented that Murdoch has long ""expressed his personal, political and business biases through his newspapers and television stations"". Former ''[[The Times|Times '' assistant editor Fred Emery remembers an incident when ""Mr. Murdoch called him into his office in March 1982 and said he was considering firing Times editor [[Harold Evans . Mr. Emery says he reminded Mr. Murdoch of his promise that editors couldn't be fired without the independent directors' approval. 'God, you don't take all that seriously, do you?' Mr. Murdoch answered, according to Mr. Emery."" Murdoch eventually forced out Evans.  In 2011, ''[[The Guardian '' found evidence that the ''Journal'' had artificially inflated its European sales numbers, by paying Executive Learning Partnership for purchasing 16% of European sales. These inflated sales numbers then enabled the ''Journal'' to charge similarly inflated advertising rates, as the advertisers would think that they reached more readers than they actually did. In addition, the ''Journal'' agreed to run ""articles"" featuring Executive Learning Partnership, presented as news, but effectively advertising.<ref name=""guardian_circulation""></ref> The case came to light after a Belgian ''Wall Street Journal'' employee, [[Gert Van Mol , informed Dow Jones CEO [[Les Hinton  about the questionable practice.<ref name=""The Hollywood Reporter""></ref> As a result, the then ''Wall Street Journal Europe'' CEO and Publisher Andrew Langhoff was fired after it was found out he personally pressured journalists into covering one of the newspaper's business partners involved in the issue.<ref name=""Pointer.""></ref><ref name=""WSJ Online ""></ref> Since September 2011 all the online articles that resulted from the ethical wrongdoing carry a Wall Street Journal disclaimer informing the readers about the circumstances in which they were created.  The ''Journal'', along with its parent Dow Jones & Company, was among the businesses News Corporation spun off in 2013 as the new [[News Corp . In November 2016, in an effort to cut costs, the ''Journal'' editor-in-chief, Gerard Baker, announced that layoffs and consolidation to its sections would take place. In the memo, the new format for the newspaper will have a ""Business & Finance"" section that will combine its current ""Business & Tech"" and ""Money & Investing"" sections. It will also include a new ""Life & Arts"" section that will combine its current ""Personal Journal"" and ""Arena"" sections. In addition, the current ""Greater New York"" coverage will be reduced and will move into the main section of paper.  ===Recent milestones===   *WSJ Live became available on mobile devices in September 2011. *''WSJ Weekend'', the weekend newspaper, expanded September 2010, with two new sections: ""Off Duty"" and ""Review"". *""Greater New York"", a stand-alone, full color section dedicated to the [[New York metropolitan area|New York metro  area, launched April 2010. *''The Wall Street Journal'' San Francisco Bay Area Edition, which focuses on local news and events, launched on November 5, 2009, appearing locally each Thursday in the print Journal and every day on online at WSJ.com/SF. *''WSJ Weekend'', formerly called ''Saturday's Weekend Edition'': September 2005. *Launch of ''Today's Journal'', which included both the addition of ''Personal Journal'' and color capacity to the ''Journal'': April 2002. *Launch of ''The Wall Street Journal Sunday'': September 12, 1999.

Subsequent Pulitzer Prizes have been awarded for editorial writing to [[Robert L. Bartley  in 1980 and [[Joseph Rago  in 2011; for criticism to [[Manuela Hoelterhoff  in 1983 and [[Joe Morgenstern  in 2005; and for commentary to [[Vermont Royster  in 1984, [[Paul Gigot  in 2000, [[Dorothy Rabinowitz  in 2001, [[Bret Stephens  in 2013, and [[Peggy Noonan  in 2017.   The Journal describes the history of its editorials:    Its historical position was much the same. As former editor [[William H. Grimes  wrote in 1951:  seen in </ref>   Each [[Thanksgiving  United States |Thanksgiving  the editorial page prints two famous articles that have appeared there since 1961. The first is titled ''The Desolate Wilderness'', and describes what the [[Pilgrim  Plymouth Colony |Pilgrims  saw when they arrived at the [[Plymouth Colony . The second is titled ''And the Fair Land'', and describes the bounty of America. It was written by a former editor, [[Vermont C. Royster , whose Christmas article ''In Hoc Anno Domini'' has appeared every December 25 since 1949.  Two summaries published in 1995 by the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive  blog [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting , and in 1996 by the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review '' criticized the ''Journal'' editorial page for inaccuracy during the 1980s and 1990s.  ===Economic views===  On September 12, 2018, the [[Census Bureau  released data showing improvement in household income and the poverty rate during 2017, Trump's first year in office. ''The Journal'' published an editorial that day attributing the improvement to Trump's purportedly superior economic policies, compared to Obama's. However, ''The Journal'''s news division reported that both figures also showed improvement in 2015 and 2016, and they improved to a greater degree in both those years than they did in 2017.  During the [[Reagan administration , the newspaper's editorial page was particularly influential as the leading voice for [[supply-side economics . Under the editorship of [[Robert L. Bartley|Robert Bartley , it expounded at length on economic concepts such as the [[Laffer curve , and how a decrease in certain marginal tax rates and the [[capital gains tax in the United States|capital gains tax  could allegedly increase overall tax revenue by generating more economic activity.  In the economic argument of [[exchange rate regime s  one of the most divisive issues among economists , the ''Journal'' has a tendency to support [[fixed exchange rate s over [[floating exchange rate s. For example, the ''Journal'' was a major supporter of the [[Chinese yuan 's peg to the dollar, and strongly disagreed with American politicians who criticized the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government  about the peg. It opposed China's move to let the yuan gradually float, arguing that the fixed rate benefited both the United States and China.  The ''Journal'' views compare with those of the British publication ''[[The Economist '', with its emphasis on free markets. However, the ''Journal'' demonstrates important distinctions from European business newspapers, most particularly in regard to the relative significance of, and causes of, the American [[budget deficit .  The ''Journal'' generally points to the lack of foreign growth, while business journals in Europe and Asia blame the low savings rate and concordant high borrowing rate in the United States .  ===Political stance=== [[File:Interview Wall Street Journal  6425462779 .jpg|thumb|[[Mark Rutte , prime minister of the [[Netherlands , being interviewed by the Journal   [[The Wall Street Journal editorial board|The ''Journal'' editorial pages and columns , run separately from the news pages, have a conservative bent and are highly influential in American conservative circles. As editors of the editorial page, [[Vermont C. Royster   served 1958–1971  and [[Robert L. Bartley   served 1972–2000  were especially influential in providing a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative interpretation  of the news on a daily basis.<ref name=""Richard Vetter 2006 pp 898"">Richard Vetter, ""Wall Street Journal,"" in Bruce Frohnen, ed. '' American Conservatism''  2006  pp 898–99</ref> Some of the ''Journal'' former reporters claim that the paper has adopted a more conservative tone since [[Rupert Murdoch 's purchase.<ref name=""nytimes.com""></ref>  The editorial board has long argued for a pro-business immigration policy. In a July 3, 1984, editorial, the board wrote: ""If Washington still wants to 'do something' about immigration, we propose a five-word constitutional amendment: There shall be [[open borders ."" This stand on [[immigration reform  places the ''Journal'' in contrast to most conservative activists, politicians, and media publications for example ''[[National Review '' and ''[[The Washington Times '', who favor heightened restrictions on immigration.  The ''Journal'' editorial page has been seen as critical of many aspects of [[Barack Obama 's presidency. In particular, it has been a prominent critic of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act  legislation passed in 2010, and has featured many opinion columns attacking various aspects of the bill. The ''Journal'' editorial page has also criticized the [[Energy policy of the Obama administration|Obama administration's energy policies  and foreign policy.  On October 25, 2017, the editorial board called for Special Counsel [[Robert Mueller  to resign from the investigation into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections  and accused [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign  of colluding with Russia. In December 2017, the editorial board repeated its calls for Mueller's resignation.<ref name="":0""></ref><ref name="":1""></ref> The editorials by the editorial board caused fractures within the ''Wall Street Journal'', as reporters say that the editorials undermine the paper's credibility.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":1"" />  ===Science=== The ''Journal'' editorial board has promoted fringe views on scientific matters, including climate change, acid rain, and ozone depletion, as well as on the health harms of second-hand smoke, pesticides and asbestos. Scholars have drawn similarities between the ''Journal''<nowiki/>'s fringe coverage of climate change and how it used to reject the settled science on acid rain and ozone depletion.<ref name=""handful"" />  ====Climate change denial==== The editorial board of ''The Wall Street Journal'' rejects the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus on climate change . The ''Journal'' disputes that it poses a major threat to human existence and can be prevented through public policy. The ''Journal'' has published articles disputing that global warming is occurring at all. ''The Journal'' is regarded as a forum for [[climate change denial|climate change skeptics ,<ref name=""Shaun W. Elsasser 2013"">Shaun W. Elsasser, Riley E.

These columns frequently attack climate scientists and accuse them of engaging in fraud. A 2015 study found ''The Wall Street Journal'' was the newspaper that was least likely to present negative [[effects of global warming  among several newspapers. It was also the most likely to present negative economic framing when discussing climate change mitigation policies, tending to taking the stance that the cost of such policies generally outweighs their benefit.   [[Climate Feedback , a fact-checking website on media coverage of climate science, has assessed that multiple opinion articles range between ""low"" and ""very low"" in terms of scientific credibility. The ''Journal'' has been accused of refusing to publish opinions of scientists which present the mainstream view on climate change. According to a 2016 analysis, 14% of the guest editorials presented the results of ""mainstream climate science"", while the majority did not. Also, none of 201 editorials published in the WSJ since 1997 concede that the burning of [[fossil fuel s was [[Attribution of recent climate change|causing climate change .   ==== Other science coverage ==== In the 1980s and 1990s, the ''Journal'' published numerous columns disputing and misrepresenting the science behind [[acid rain  and the scientific consensus behind the causes of [[ozone depletion  and the health harms of [[Passive smoking|second-hand smoke , and opposed public policy efforts to curb acid rain, ozone depletion and second-hand smoke.<ref name=""handful""></ref><ref name="":2""></ref> The ''Journal'' has also published columns attacking efforts to control pesticides and asbestos.<ref name=""handful"" /> By the 2000s, the ''Journal'' editorial board recognized that efforts to curb acid rain through cap-and-trade had been successful.<ref name="":2"" />  ===Bias in news pages=== The ''Journal''s editors stress the independence and impartiality of their reporters.<ref name=""Crovitz"" /> According to CNN in 2007, the ''Journal''<nowiki/>'s ""newsroom staff has a reputation for non-partisan reporting.""  In a 2004 study, Tim Groseclose and [[Jeffrey Milyo|Jeff Milyo  argue the ''Journal'' news pages have a pro-liberal bias because they more often quote liberal think tanks. They calculated the ideological attitude of news reports in 20 media outlets by counting the frequency they cited particular [[think tank s and comparing that to the frequency that legislators cited the same think tanks. They found that the news reporting of ''The Journal'' was the most liberal  more liberal than [[NPR  or ''[[The New York Times '' . The study did not factor in editorials. [[Mark Liberman  criticized the model used to calculate bias in the study and argued that the model unequally affected liberals and conservatives and that ""..the model starts with a very peculiar assumption about the relationship between political opinion and the choice of authorities to cite.""

The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form.

The Wall Street Journal reported the plan to drop coverage stemmed from new health care requirements under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . McDonald's called the report ""speculative and misleading"", stating they had no plans to drop coverage. The Wall Street Journal report and subsequent rebuttal received coverage from several other media outlets.  ===2015: Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak and 1MDB=== In 2015, a report published by the ''Journal'' alleged that up to US$700 million was wired from [[1MDB , a Malaysian state investment company, to the personal accounts of Malaysia Prime Minister [[Najib Razak  at [[AmBank , the fifth largest lender in Malaysia.

Javed Jalil Khattak, [[Consulate General of Pakistan in Dubai , in an open letter to ''Gulf News'' termed the editorial as ""an orchestrated attempt to damage and defame the historic fraternal relations between Pakistan and the UAE"".

It is owned by the Fox News Group, which itself was owned by [[News Corporation  from 1996&ndash;2013, [[21st Century Fox  from 2013&ndash;2019, and [[Fox Corporation  since 2019. The channel broadcasts primarily from studios at [[1211 Avenue of the Americas  in [[New York City . Fox News is provided in 86 countries or overseas territories worldwide, with international broadcasts featuring Fox Extra segments during ad breaks.  The channel was created by Australian-American [[media proprietor|media mogul  [[Rupert Murdoch  to appeal to a conservative audience, hiring former [[Republican Party  United States |Republican Party  media consultant and [[CNBC  executive [[Roger Ailes  as its founding [[Chief executive officer|CEO . It launched on October 7, 1996, to 17 million cable subscribers.<ref name=King/> Fox News grew during the late 1990s and 2000s to become the dominant [[United States cable news|subscription news network in the US . , approximately 94,700,000 US households  81.4% of television subscribers  receive Fox News. Murdoch is the current executive chairman and [[Suzanne Scott  is the CEO.  Fox News has been described as practicing [[Fox News controversies|biased reporting  in favor of the [[Republican Party  United States |Republican Party , the [[George W. Bush  and [[Donald Trump  administrations and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative  causes while slandering the [[Democratic Party  United States |Democratic Party  and spreading harmful propaganda intended to negatively affect its members' electoral performances.<ref name="":29""></ref><ref name="":33""></ref><ref name="":31""></ref><ref name="":34"" /> Critics have cited the channel as detrimental to the integrity of news overall.<ref name=""Collings2010""></ref><ref name=""McCollumHebert2014""></ref> Fox News employees have said that news reporting operates independently of its [[opinion journalism|opinion and commentary programming , and have denied bias in news reporting, while former employees have said that Fox ordered them to ""slant the news in favor of conservatives.""  ==History==  [[Image:Roger Ailes, TV Titan 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roger Ailes  and [[Rupert Murdoch  established Fox News in 1996.  In May 1985, Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch announced he and American [[Business magnate|industrialist  and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist  [[Marvin Davis  intended to develop ""a network of [[Independent station  North America |independent stations  as a fourth marketing force"" to compete directly with [[CBS , [[NBC , and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC  through the purchase of six television stations owned by [[Metromedia . In July 1985, [[20th Century Fox  announced Murdoch had completed his purchase of 50% of [[Fox Entertainment Group|Fox Filmed Entertainment , the parent company of 20th Century Fox Film Corporation. A year later, 20th Century Fox earned $5.6 million in its fiscal third period ended May 31, 1986, in contrast to a loss of $55.8 million in the third period of the previous year.  Subsequently, and prior to founding FNC, Murdoch had gained experience in the 24-hour news business when [[News Corporation 's [[BSkyB  subsidiary began Europe's first 24-hour news channel  [[Sky News   in the United Kingdom in 1989. With the success of his [[The Fourth Network|fourth network  efforts in the United States, experience gained from Sky News and the turnaround of 20th Century Fox, Murdoch announced on January 31, 1996, that News Corp. would launch a 24-hour news channel on cable and satellite systems in the United States as part of a News Corp. ""worldwide platform"" for Fox programming: ""The appetite for news&nbsp;– particularly news that explains to people how it affects them&nbsp;– is expanding enormously"".  In February 1996, after former U.S. Republican Party political strategist and NBC executive [[Roger Ailes  left cable television channel [[America's Talking   now [[MSNBC  , Murdoch asked him to start Fox News Channel. Ailes demanded five months of 14-hour workdays and several weeks of rehearsal shows before its launch on October 7, 1996.  At its debut 17 million households were able to watch FNC;<ref name=King></ref> however, it was absent from the media markets of New York City and Los Angeles. Rolling news coverage during the day consisted of 20-minute single-topic shows such as ''Fox on Crime'' or ''Fox on Politics'', surrounded by news headlines. Interviews featured facts at the bottom of the screen about the topic or the guest. The flagship newscast at the time was ''The Schneider Report'', with [[Mike Schneider  news anchor |Mike Schneider 's fast-paced delivery of the news. During the evening, Fox featured opinion shows: ''The O'Reilly Report''  later ''[[The O'Reilly Factor '' , ''The Crier Report''  hosted by [[Catherine Crier   and ''[[Hannity & Colmes ''.  From the beginning, FNC has placed heavy emphasis on visual presentation. Graphics were designed to be colorful and gain attention; this helped the viewer to grasp the main points of what was being said, even if they could not hear the host  with on-screen text summarizing the position of the interviewer or speaker, and ""bullet points"" when a host was delivering commentary . Fox News also created the ""Fox News Alert"", which interrupted its regular programming when a [[breaking news  story occurred. [[Image:Fox News 6th 48 jeh.JPG|thumb|right|Fox News Studios in 2009.  To accelerate its adoption by cable providers, Fox News paid systems up to $11 per subscriber to distribute the channel. This contrasted with the normal practice, in which cable operators paid stations carriage fees for programming. When [[Time Warner  bought [[Ted Turner 's [[Turner Broadcasting System , a federal [[antitrust  [[consent decree  required Time Warner to carry a second all-news channel in addition to its own [[CNN  on its [[Time Warner Cable|cable systems . Time Warner selected MSNBC as the secondary news channel, not Fox News. Fox News claimed this violated an agreement  to carry Fox News . Citing its agreement to keep its U.S. headquarters and a large studio in New York City, News Corporation enlisted the help of Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani 's administration to pressure Time Warner Cable  one of the city's two cable providers  to transmit Fox News on a city-owned channel. City officials threatened to take action affecting Time Warner's cable franchises in the city.  During the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks , Fox News was the first news organization to run a [[news ticker  on the bottom of the screen to keep up with the flow of information that day. The ticker has remained, informing viewers about additional news which reporters may not mention on-screen and repeating news mentioned during a broadcast; it has proven popular with viewers.<ref name=""The Fox News Ticker""></ref>  ==Outlets== [[File:FOX News Channel Stand.jpg|thumb|FNC airport [[newsagent|newsstand  at [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport |alt=Fox News airport newsstand [[File:Fox News Channel newsroom.jpg|thumb|right|FNC's [[newsroom , November 15, 2007.|alt=Television news studio <!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Fox Newsroom January 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Fox Newsroom January 2018|alt=Fox Newsroom|220x220px  --> FNC maintains an archive of most of its programs. This archive also includes [[Fox Movietone  newsreels. Licensing for the Fox News archive is handled by ITN Source, the archiving division of [[ITN .  ===Television===  FNC presents a variety of programming, with up to 15 hours of live broadcasting per day in addition to programming and content for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company . Most programs are broadcast from Fox News headquarters in New York City  at [[1211 Avenue of the Americas  , in its streetside studio on [[Sixth Avenue  Manhattan |Sixth Avenue  in the west wing of [[Rockefeller Center , sharing its headquarters with sister channel [[Fox Business Network . Fox News Channel has eight studios at its New York City headquarters that are used for its and Fox Business' programming: Studio B  used for Fox Business programming , Studio D  which has an area for studio audiences; and is used by [[The Greg Gutfeld Show , [[Fox & Friends First|Fox and Friends First  , Studio F  used for [[The Story with Martha MacCallum , [[The Five  talk show |The Five , and [[America's Election Headquarters , [[Fox & Friends|Fox and Friends , [[Outnumbered  U.S. TV program |Outnumbered , Outnumbered Overtime, [[America's News Headquarters|America's News HQ , [[Justice with Judge Jeanine   Studio G  which houses Fox Business shows , Studio H  Fox News Deck used for ''[[Shepard Smith Reporting '' and breaking news coverage , Studio J  used for ''[[America's Newsroom '', ''[[Hannity '' and ''[[Justice with Judge Jeanine ''   Starting with , [[Thursday Night Football  will have its pregame show, [[Fox NFL Sunday|Fox NFL Thursday  originate from the Fox News studio.  The remaining programs  such as ''[[Tucker Carlson Tonight '', ''[[Special Report with Bret Baier '', ''[[The Ingraham Angle '', ''[[Fox News @ Night '', and editions of ''America's News HQ'' not broadcast from the New York City studios  are broadcast from Fox News's Washington, D.C. studios, located on [[Capitol Hill  across from [[Union Station  Washington, D.C. |Union Station  in a secured building shared by a number of other television networks  including [[NBC News  and [[C-SPAN  . Audio simulcasts of the channel are aired on [[XM Satellite Radio  and [[Sirius Satellite Radio .  In an October 11, 2009, in a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times '' article, Fox said its hard-news programming runs from ""9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 to 8 p.m. on weekdays"" and ""[is] objective""; however, it makes no such claims for its other broadcasts, which primarily consist of editorial journalism and commentary.  Fox News Channel began broadcasting in the [[720p  resolution format on May 1, 2008.<ref name=""multichannel1""></ref> This format is available on all major cable and satellite providers.  The Fox News Group produces ''[[Fox News Sunday '', which airs on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company  and re-airs on FNC. Fox News also produces occasional special event coverage that is broadcast on FBC.  ===Radio===  With the growth of FNC, the company introduced a radio division, [[Fox News Radio , in 2003. [[Syndicated radio show|Syndicated  throughout the United States, the division provides short newscasts and talk radio programs featuring personalities from the television and radio divisions. In 2006, the company also introduced [[Fox News Talk , a [[satellite radio  station featuring programs syndicated by  and featuring  Fox News personalities.  ===Online=== Introduced in December 1995, the Fox News website features the latest coverage  including columns by FNC television, radio and online personalities . Video clips are also available on Foxnews.com and Foxbusiness.com. Fox News Latino is the version aimed at the [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic  audience, although presented almost entirely in English, with a Spanish section.  In September 2008, FNC joined other channels in introducing a live streaming segment to its website: ''The Strategy Room'', designed to appeal to older viewers. It airs weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and takes the form of an informal discussion, with running commentary on the news. Regular discussion programs include ''Business Hour'', ''News With a View'' and ''God Talk''. In March 2009, [[The Fox Nation  was launched as a website intended to encourage readers to post, commenting on the news. Fox News Mobile is the portion of the FNC website dedicated to [[Streaming media|streaming  news clips formatted for video-enabled mobile phones.  ==Ratings and reception== In 2003, Fox News saw a large ratings jump during the early stages of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|US invasion of Iraq . At the height of the conflict, according to some reports, Fox News had as much as a 300% increase in viewership  averaging 3.3 million viewers daily . In 2004, Fox News' ratings for its broadcast of the [[2004 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention  exceeded those of the three major broadcast networks. During President [[George W. Bush 's address, Fox News attracted 7.3 million viewers nationally; NBC, ABC, and CBS had a viewership of 5.9 million, 5.1 million, and 5.0 million respectively.  Between late-2005 and early-2006, Fox News saw a brief decline in ratings. One was in the second quarter of 2006, when it lost viewers for every prime-time program compared with the previous quarter. The audience for the ''[[Special Report with Bret Baier|Special Report with Brit Hume '', for example, dropped 19%. Several weeks later, in the wake of the [[2006 North Korean missile test  and the [[2006 Lebanon War , Fox saw a surge in viewership and remained the #1-rated cable news channel. Fox produced eight of the top ten most-watched nightly cable news shows, with ''The O'Reilly Factor'' and ''[[Hannity & Colmes '' finishing first and second respectively.  FNC ranked #8 in viewership among all cable channels in 2006, and #6 in 2007. The channel ranked #1 during the week of Barack Obama's election  November 3–9  in 2008, and reached the top spot again in January 2010  during the week of the [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 2010|special Senate election in Massachusetts  . Comparing Fox to its 24-hour-news-channel competitors, in May 2010 the channel drew an average daily prime-time audience of 1.8 million viewers  versus 747,000 for MSNBC and 595,000 for CNN .  In September 2009, the [[Pew Research Center  published a report on the public view of national news organizations. In the report, 72 percent of polled Republican Fox viewers rated the channel as ""favorable"", while 43 percent of polled Democratic viewers and 55 percent of all polled viewers shared that opinion. However, Fox was given the highest ""unfavorable"" rating of all national outlets studied  25 percent of all polled viewers . The report went on to say, ""partisan differences in views of Fox News have increased substantially since 2007"". A Public Policy Polling poll concluded in 2013 that perceptions of FNC had declined from 2010. 41% of polled voters said they trust it, down from 49% in 2010, while 46% said they distrust it, up from 37% in 2010. It was also called the ""most trusted"" network by 34% of those polled, more than had said the same of any other network.  [[File:2012 DNC day 3 Fox News  7959676796 .jpg|thumb|Then-Fox anchor [[Megyn Kelly  covering the [[2012 Democratic National Convention   On the night of October 22, 2012, Fox set a record for its highest-rated [[Broadcasting|telecast  ever, with 11.5 million viewers for the third [[United States presidential election debates, 2012|U.S. presidential debate . In prime time the week before, Fox averaged almost 3.7 million viewers with a total day average of 1.66 million viewers.  In [[prime time  and total day ratings for the week of April 15 to 21, 2013, Fox News, propelled by its coverage of the [[Boston Marathon bombing , was the highest-ranked network on U.S. [[cable television , for the first time since August 2005, when [[Hurricane Katrina  hit the [[Gulf Coast of the United States . January 2014 marked Fox News's 145th consecutive month as the number one rated cable news channel. During that month, Fox News beat CNN and MSNBC combined in overall viewers in both [[prime time  hours and the total day. In the third quarter of 2014, the network was the most-watched cable channel during prime time hours. During the final week of the campaign for the [[United States elections, 2014 , Fox News had the highest ratings of any cable channel, news or otherwise. On election night itself, Fox News' coverage had higher ratings than that of any of the other five cable or network news sources among viewers between 25 and 54 years of age. The network hosted the first prime-time GOP candidates' forum of the 2016 campaign on August 6. The debate reached a record-breaking 24 million viewers, by far the largest audience ever for any cable news event.  ===Demographics=== As indicated by a ''New York Times'' article, based on [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen  statistics, Fox appears to have a mostly aged demographic. In 2008, in the 25–54 age group, Fox News had an average of 557,000 viewers, but dropped to 379,000 in 2013 while increasing its overall audience from 1.89 million in 2010 to 2.02 million in 2013. The median age of a prime-time viewer was 68 . A study done by the [[Pew Research Center  found that around 60% of Fox News viewers identify as conservative.  According to a 2013 [[Gallup  company |Gallup  poll, 94% of Fox viewers either identify themselves or lean Republican.  ==Slogan== Fox News Channel originally used the slogan ""Fair and Balanced"", which was coined by network co-founder Roger Ailes while the network was being established. ''[[The New York Times '' described the slogan as being a ""blunt signal that Fox News planned to counteract what Mr. Ailes and many others viewed as a [[liberal media|liberal bias  ingrained in television coverage by establishment news networks.""<ref name=""nyt-fairandbalanced""></ref><ref name=""salon-fairandbalanced""></ref>  In August 2003, Fox [[Fox v.

In his decision, Chin ruled the case was ""wholly without merit, both factually and legally"".

[http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/08/22/fox.franken/ Fox News loses attempt to block satirist's book]. ''CNN''</ref> In December 2003, FNC won a legal battle concerning the slogan, when [[AlterNet  filed a cancellation petition with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office   USPTO  to have FNC's trademark rescinded as inaccurate. AlterNet included [[Robert Greenwald 's documentary film ''[[Outfoxed ''  2004  as supporting evidence in its case.<ref name=""coyle"">Coyle, Jake  July 19, 2004 . Advocacy Groups Challenge Fox News Slogan. Associated Press</ref> After losing early motions, AlterNet withdrew its petition; the USPTO dismissed the case. In 2008, FNC used the slogan ""We Report, You Decide"", referring to ""You Decide 2008""  FNC's original slogan for its coverage of election issues .  In August 2016, Fox News Channel began to quietly phase out the ""Fair and Balanced"" slogan in favor of ""Most Watched, Most Trusted""; when these changes were reported in June 2017 by [[Gabriel Sherman   a writer who had written a biography on Ailes , a network executive said the change ""has nothing to do with programming or editorial decisions."" It was speculated by media outlets that Fox News Channel was wishing to distance itself from Ailes' tenure at the network.<ref name=""nyt-fairandbalanced""/><ref name=""salon-fairandbalanced""/> In March 2018, the network introduced a new ad campaign, ''Real News. Real Honest Opinion.'' The ad campaign is intended to promote the network's opinion-based programming and counter perceptions surrounding ""[[fake news "". Fox News still keeps both the ""Fair & Balanced"" and ""Most Watched. Most Trusted."" slogans.  ==Content==    ===Benghazi attack and aftermath===  Fox News provided extensive coverage of the [[2012 Benghazi attack , which host [[Sean Hannity  described in December 2012 as ""the story that the mainstream media ignores"" and ""obviously, a cover-up. And we will get to the bottom of it."" Programming analysis by [[Media Matters  found that during the twenty months following the Benghazi attacks, FNC ran 1,098 segments on the issue, including:  * 478 segments involving [[Susan Rice 's September 16, 2012 Sunday news show appearances, during which she was falsely accused of lying * 382 segments on ''Special Report'', the network's flagship news program * 281 segments alleging a ""cover-up"" by the Obama administration * 144 interviews of GOP members of Congress, but only five interviews of Democratic members of Congress and Obama administration officials * 120 comparisons to Iran-Contra, Watergate, and the actions of the Nixon administration * 100 segments falsely suggesting the administration issued a ""stand-down order"" to prevent a rescue operation in Benghazi  Over nearly four years after the Benghazi attack, there were [[Investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack|ten official investigations , including six by Republican-controlled House committees. None of the investigations found any evidence of scandal, cover-up or lying by Obama administration officials.  On June 29, 2018, Fox News broadcast a segment by news anchor [[Bret Baier  entitled ""Whatever happened to the Benghazi investigation?"" which repeated some of the accusations the network had previously made about Susan Rice and [[Hillary Clinton , but for which the women had been exonerated by the official investigations.  ===Uranium One===  From 2015 into 2018, Fox News broadcast extensive coverage of an alleged scandal surrounding the sale of [[Uranium One  to Russian interests, which host Sean Hannity characterized as ""one of the biggest scandals in American history."" The Fox News coverage extended throughout the programming day, with particular emphasis by Hannity. The network promoted an ultimately unfounded narrative asserting that, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton personally approved the Uranium One sale in exchange for $145 million in bribes paid to the [[Clinton Foundation . [[Donald Trump  repeated these allegations as a candidate and as president.<ref name=""WPFoxdebunk""></ref> No evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton had been found after three years of allegations, an FBI investigation, and the 2017 appointment of a Federal attorney to evaluate the investigation. In November 2017, Fox News host [[Shepard Smith  concisely debunked the alleged scandal, infuriating viewers who suggested he should work for CNN or MSNBC.<ref name=""WPFoxdebunk"" /> Hannity later called Smith ""clueless,"" while Smith stated, ""I get it, that some of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining. I get that. I don't work there. I wouldn't work there.""  ===Pro-Republican and pro-Trump bias=== Fox News Channel has been widely described as providing [[Fox News controversies|biased reporting  in favor of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative political positions ,<ref name="":29""/><ref name="":33""/><ref name="":35""></ref><ref name="":14""></ref><ref name="":36""></ref> the [[Republican Party  United States |Republican Party <ref name=""LaMonica2009""></ref><ref name="":30""></ref><ref name="":31""/> and President Donald Trump.<ref name="":26""></ref><ref name="":34""></ref> Political scientist Jonathan Bernstein described Fox News as an expanded part of the Republican Party.<ref name="":30"" /><ref name="":31"" /> Political scientists Matt Grossmann and David A. Hopkins write that Fox News has helped ""Republicans communicate with their base and spread their ideas, and they have been effective in mobilizing voters to participate in midterm elections  as in 2010 and 2014 .""<ref name="":31"" /> Prior to 2000, Fox News lacked an ideological tilt, and even had more Democrats watch the channel than Republicans. During the 2004 presidential election, Fox News was markedly more hostile in its coverage of Democratic presidential nominee [[John Kerry , and distinguished itself among cable news outlets for heavy coverage of the [[Swiftboating|Swift Boat smear campaign  against Kerry. During Obama's first term in office, Fox News helped launch and amplify the [[Tea Party movement , a conservative movement within the Republican party that organized protests against Obama and his policies.<ref name="":32""></ref><ref name="":29"" /><ref name="":36"" />  During the Republican primaries, Fox News was widely perceived as trying to prevent Trump from clinching the nomination.<ref name="":35"" /> However, under Trump's presidency, Fox News remade itself into his image, as nearly no criticism could be heard of Trump on Fox News' prime-time shows.<ref name="":24""></ref><ref name="":26"" /> Even in Fox News' news reporting, the network dedicated far more coverage to Hillary Clinton-related stories, which critics say was intended to deflect attention from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.<ref name="":24"" /> Trump provided great access to Fox News during his presidency, giving 19 interviews to the channel while only 6 in total to other news channels by November 2017; ''The New York Times'' described Trump's Fox News interviews as ""softball interviews"" and some of the interviewers' interview styles as ""fawning""; similarly, ''[[The Economist '' has described the network's coverage of Trump's presidency as ""reliably fawning."" From 2015 to 2017, the Fox News prime-time line-up changed from one that was skeptical and questioning of Trump to a ""Trump safe space, with a dose of Bannonist populism once considered on the fringe.""<ref name="":25"" /> The Fox News website has also gotten more extreme in its rhetoric since the election of Donald Trump; according to Columbia's Tow Center for Digital Journalism, the Fox News website has ""gone a little Breitbart"" over time. At the start of 2018, Fox News mostly ignored prominent scandals in the Trump administration which received ample coverage in other national media outlets, such as White House Staff Secretary [[Rob Porter 's resignation amid domestic abuse allegations, the downgrading of [[Jared Kushner 's security clearance and the existence of a [[non-disclosure agreement  between Trump and the porn star [[Stormy Daniels .   In March 2019, [[Jane Mayer  reported in [[The New Yorker  that Fox News.com reporter [[Diana Falzone  had the story of the [[Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal  before the 2016 election, but that Fox News executive [[Ken  LaCorte  told her, “Good reporting, kiddo. But Rupert [Murdoch] wants Donald Trump to win. So just let it go,” and the story was killed. LaCorte denied making the statement to Falzone, but conceded, ""I was the person who made the call. I didn’t run it upstairs to Roger Ailes or others...I didn’t do it to protect Donald Trump,"" adding ""[Falzone] had put up a story that just wasn’t anywhere close to being something I was comfortable publishing.” [[Nik Richie , who claimed to be one of the sources for the story, called LaCorte's account ""complete bullshit,"" adding “Fox News was culpable. I voted for Trump, and I like Fox, but they did their own ‘[[catch and kill ’ on the story to protect him.”  A 2008 study found Fox News gave disproportionate attention to polls suggesting low approval for President [[Bill Clinton . A 2009 study found Fox News was less likely to pick up stories that reflected well on Democrats, and more likely to pick up stories that reflected well on Republicans. A 2010 study comparing Fox News Channel's ''Special Report With Brit Hume'' and NBC's ''[[NBC Nightly News|Nightly News '' coverage of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan during 2005 concluded ""Fox News was much more sympathetic to the administration than NBC"", suggesting ""if scholars continue to find evidence of a partisan or ideological bias at FNC ... they should consider Fox as alternative, rather than mainstream, media"".  Research also suggests Fox News increases Republican vote shares and makes Republican politicians more partisan.<ref name="":13""></ref><ref name="":14"" /><ref name="":15""></ref><ref name="":16""></ref> A 2007 study, using the introduction of Fox News into local markets  1996–2000  as an instrumental variable, found that in the 2000 presidential election ""Republicans gained 0.4 to 0.7 percentage points in the towns that broadcast Fox News"", suggesting ""Fox News convinced 3 to 28 percent of its viewers to vote Republican, depending on the audience measure"".<ref name="":14"" /> These results were confirmed by a 2015 study.<ref name="":16"" /> A 2014 study, using the same instrumental variable, found congressional ""representatives become less supportive of President Clinton in districts where Fox News begins broadcasting than similar representatives in similar districts where Fox News was not broadcast.""<ref name="":15"" /> A 2017 study, using channel positions as an instrumental variable, found ""Fox News increases Republican vote shares by 0.3 points among viewers induced into watching 2.5 additional minutes per week by variation in position.""<ref name="":13"" /> Another 2014 paper found Fox News viewing increased Republican vote shares among voters who identified as Republican or independent.  Fox News publicly denies it is biased, with Murdoch and Ailes saying have included Murdoch's statement that Fox has ""given room to both sides, whereas only one side had it before"". Fox News host [[Chris Wallace  has said, ""I think we are the counter-weight [to NBC News] ... they have a liberal agenda, and we tell the other side of the story.""  In 2004, [[Robert Greenwald 's documentary film ''[[Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism '' argued Fox News had a conservative bias and featured clips from Fox News and internal memos from editorial vice president [[John Moody  journalist |John Moody  directing Fox News staff on how to report certain subjects.<ref name=""tilting""></ref><ref name=""ChristiansFackler2015""></ref>  A leaked memo from Fox News vice president [[Bill Sammon  to news staff at the height of the [[health care reform in the United States  debate has been cited as an example of the pro-[[Republican Party  United States |Republican Party  bias of Fox News. His memo asked the staff to ""use the term 'government-run health insurance,' or, when brevity is a concern, 'government option,' whenever possible"". The memo was sent shortly after Republican pollster [[Frank Luntz  advised [[Sean Hannity  on his Fox show, ""If you call it a public option, the American people are split. If you call it the government option, the public is overwhelmingly against it"".  Surveys suggest Fox News is widely perceived to be ideological. A 2009 Pew survey found Fox News is viewed as the most ideological channel in America, with 47 percent of those surveyed said Fox News is ""mostly conservative"", 14 percent said ""mostly liberal"" and 24 percent said ""neither"". In comparison, [[MSNBC  had 36 percent identify it as ""mostly liberal"", 11 percent as ""mostly conservative"" and 27 percent as ""neither"". [[CNN  had 37 percent describe it as ""mostly liberal"", 11 percent as ""mostly conservative"" and 33 percent as ""neither"". A 2004 [[Pew Research Center  survey found FNC was cited  unprompted  by 69 percent of national journalists as a conservative news organization. A [[Rasmussen Reports|Rasmussen  poll found 31 percent of Americans felt Fox News had a conservative bias, and 15 percent that it had a liberal bias. It found 36 percent believed Fox News delivers news with neither a conservative or liberal bias, compared with 37 percent who said [[NPR  delivers news with no conservative or liberal bias and 32 percent who said the same of CNN.  [[David Carr  journalist |David Carr , media critic for ''[[The New York Times '', praised the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential election  results coverage on Fox News for the network's response to Republican adviser and Fox News contributor [[Karl Rove  challenging its call that [[Barack Obama  would win Ohio and the election. Fox's prediction was correct. Carr wrote:    A May 2017 study conducted by [[Harvard University 's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy examined coverage of Trump's [[First 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency|first 100 days  in office by several major mainstream media outlets including Fox. It found Trump received 80% negative coverage from the overall media, and received the least negative coverage on Fox – 52% negative and 48% positive.  On March 14, 2017, [[Andrew Napolitano , a Fox News commentator, claimed on ''Fox & Friends'' that British intelligence agency [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ  had wiretapped Donald Trump on behalf of Barack Obama during the 2016 [[United States presidential election, 2016|United States presidential election. <ref name="":0""></ref> On March 16, 2017, White House spokesman [[Sean Spicer  repeated the claim.<ref name="":0"" /> When Trump was questioned about the claim at a news conference, he said ""All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didn't make an opinion on it.""<ref name="":1""></ref> On March 17, 2017, [[Shepard Smith , a Fox News anchor, admitted the network had no evidence that Trump was under surveillance. British officials said the White House was backing off the claim.<ref name="":1"" /> Napolitano was later suspended by Fox News for making the claim.  In June 2018, Fox News executives instructed producers to head off inappropriate remarks made on the shows aired by the network by hosts and commentators.<ref name="":40""></ref> The instructions came after a number of Fox News hosts and guests made incendiary comments about [[Trump administration family separation policy|the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents .<ref name="":40"" /> Fox News host Laura Ingraham had likened the child detention centers that the children were in to ""summer camps"". Guest [[Corey Lewandowski  mocked the story of a 10-year-old child with Down's syndrome being separated from her mother; the Fox News host did not address Lewandowski's statement.<ref name="":40"" /> Guest [[Ann Coulter  falsely claimed that the separated children were ""child actors""; the Fox News host did not challenge her claim.<ref name="":40"" /> In a segment on Trump's alleged use of racial dog whistles, one Fox News contributor told an African-American whom he was debating, ""You're out of your cotton-picking mind.""<ref name="":40"" />  According to the 2016 book ''Asymmetric Politics'' by political scientists Matt Grossmann and David A. Hopkins, Fox News tends to raise the profile of scandals and controversies involving Democrats that receive scant attention in other media, such as the relationship between Barack Obama and William Ayers ... Hillary Clinton's role in the fatal 2012 attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya; the gun-running scandal known as ""Fast and Furious""; the business practices of federal loan guarantee recipient Solyndra; the past activism of Obama White House operative Van Jones; the 2004 attacks on John Kerry by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth; the controversial sermons of Obama's Chicago pastor Jeremiah Wright; the filming of undercover videos of supposed wrongdoing by the liberal activist group ACORN; and even the ""war on Christmas"" supposedly waged every December by secular, multicultural liberals.""<ref name="":32"" />  In October 2018, Fox News ran laudatory coverage of a meeting between Trump-supporting rapper Kanye West and President Trump in the Oval Office. Fox News had previously run negative coverage of rappers and their involvement with Democratic politicians and causes, such as when Fox News ran headlines describing conscious hip-hop artist Common as ""vile"" and a ""cop-killer rapper"", and when Fox News ran negative coverage of Kanye West before he became a Trump supporter.  On November 4, 2018, Trump's website, DonaldJTrump.com, announced in a press release that Fox News host Sean Hannity would make a ""special guest appearance"" with Trump at a midterm campaign rally the following night in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.<ref name=""auto""></ref> The following morning, Hannity tweeted ""To be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the President."" Hannity appeared at the president's lectern on stage at the rally, immediately mocking the ""fake news"" at the back of the auditorium, Fox News reporters among them. Several Fox News employees expressed outrage at Hannity's actions, with one stating, ""a new line was crossed."" Hannity later asserted that his action was not pre-planned, and Fox News stated it ""does not condone any talent participating in campaign events."" Fox News host [[Jeanine Pirro  also appeared on stage with Trump at the rally. The Trump press release was later removed from Trump's website.<ref name=""auto""/>  === Coverage of Russia investigation === On October 30, 2017, when special counsel Robert S. Mueller III indicted Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, and revealed George Papadopoulos had plead guilty  all of whom were involved in the Trump 2016 campaign , this was the focus of most media's coverage, except Fox News'.<ref name="":19""></ref> Hosts and guests on Fox News called for Mueller to be fired.<ref name="":19"" /> Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson focused their shows on unsubstantiated allegations that Clinton sold uranium to Russia in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation and on the Clinton campaign's role in funding the [[Donald Trump–Russia dossier .<ref name="":19"" /><ref name="":20""></ref> Hannity asserted, ""The very thing they are accusing President Trump of doing, they did it themselves.""<ref name="":19"" /> During the segment, Hannity mistakenly referred to Clinton as President Clinton.<ref name="":19"" /> Fox News dedicated extensive coverage to the uranium story, which Democrats said was an attempt to distract from Mueller's intensifying investigation. ''CNN'' described the coverage as ""a tour de force in deflection and dismissal.""<ref name="":20"" /> On October 31, ''CNN'' reported Fox News employees were dissatisfied with their outlet's coverage of the Russia investigation, with employees calling it an ""embarrassment"", ""laughable"" and saying it ""does the viewer a huge disservice and further divides the country"" and that it is ""another blow to journalists at Fox who come in every day wanting to cover the news in a fair and objective way"".  When the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election  intensified in October 2017, the focus of Fox News coverage turned ""what they see as the scandal and wrongdoing of President Trump's political opponents. In reports like these, Bill and Hillary Clinton are prominent and recurring characters because they are considered the real conspirators working with the Russians to undermine American democracy."" Paul Waldman of the ''Washington Post'' described the coverage as ""No puppet. You're the puppet"", saying it was a ""careful, coordinated, and comprehensive strategy"" to distract from Mueller's investigation. German Lopes of ''Vox'' said Fox News' coverage has reached ""levels of self-parody"" as it dedicated coverage to low-key stories, such as a controversial Newsweek op-ed and hamburger emojis, while other networks had wall-to-wall coverage of Mueller's indictments.  A ''[[FiveThirtyEight '' analysis of Russia-related media coverage in cable news found most mentions of Russia on Fox News were spoken in close proximity to ""uranium"" and ""dossier"". On November 1, 2017, ''Vox'' analyzed the transcripts of Fox News, CNN and MSNBC, and found Fox News ""was unable to talk about the Mueller investigation without bringing up Hillary Clinton"", ""talked significantly less about George Papadopoulos — the Trump campaign adviser whose plea deal with Mueller provides the most explicit evidence thus far that the campaign knew of the Russian government's efforts to help Trump — than its competitors"", and ""repeatedly called Mueller's credibility into question"".  In December 2017, Fox News escalated its attacks on the Mueller investigation, with hosts and guest commentators suggesting the investigation amounted to a [[Coup d'état|coup .<ref name="":27""></ref><ref name="":28""></ref> Guest co-host Kevin Jackson referred to a right-wing conspiracy theory claiming Strzok's messages are evidence of a plot by FBI agents to assassinate Trump, a claim which the other Fox co-hosts quickly said is not supported by any credible evidence. Fox News host Jeanine Pirro called the Mueller investigation team a ""criminal cabal"" and said the team ought to be arrested.<ref name="":27"" /> Other Fox News figures referred to the investigation as ""corrupt"", ""crooked"" and ""illegitimate"", and likened the FBI to the KGB, the Soviet-era spy organization that routinely tortured and summarily executed people.<ref name="":28"" /> Political scientists and scholars of coups described the Fox News rhetoric as scary and dangerous.<ref name="":28"" /> Experts on coups rejected that the Mueller investigation amounted to a coup; rather, the Fox News rhetoric was dangerous to democracy and mirrored the kind of rhetoric that occurs before [[purge s.<ref name="":28"" /> A number of observers argued the Fox News rhetoric was intended to discredit the Mueller investigation and sway President Donald Trump to fire Mueller.  In August 2018, Fox News was criticized for giving more prominent coverage of a murder committed by an undocumented immigrant than the convictions of Donald Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and his long-term personal attorney, Michael Cohen.<ref name="":41""></ref> At the same time, most other national mainstream media gave wall-to-wall coverage of the convictions. Fox News hosts Dana Perrino and Jason Chaffetz argued that voters care far more about the murder than the convictions of the President's former top aides, and hosts Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity downplayed the convictions.<ref name="":41"" />  === False claims about other media ===  ==== CNN's Jake Tapper ==== In November 2017, in the immediate aftermath of the [[2017 New York City truck attack  wherein a terrorist shouted ""Allahu Akbar"", Fox News distorted a statement by Jake Tapper to make it appear as if he had said ""[[Takbir|Allahu Akbar "" can be used under the most ""beautiful circumstances"".<ref name="":21""></ref> Fox News omitted that Tapper had said the use of ""Allahu Akbar"" in the terrorist attack was not one of these beautiful circumstances.<ref name="":21"" /> A headline on FoxNews.com was preceded by a tag reading ""OUTRAGEOUS"".<ref name="":21"" /> The Fox News Twitter account distorted the statement even more, saying ""Jake Tapper Says 'Allahu Akbar' Is 'Beautiful' Right After NYC Terror Attack"" in a tweet that was later deleted.<ref name="":21"" /> Tapper chastised Fox News for choosing to ""deliberately lie"" and said ""there was a time when one could tell the difference between Fox and the nutjobs at Infowars. It's getting tougher and tougher. Lies are lies.""<ref name="":21"" /> Tapper had in 2009, while a White House correspondent for ABC News, come to the defense of Fox News when Obama criticized the network for not being a legitimate news organization.<ref name="":22""></ref>  Fox News guest host Jason Chaffetz apologized to Tapper for misrepresenting his statement.<ref name="":23""></ref> After Fox News had deleted the tweet, Sean Hannity repeated the misrepresentation and called Tapper ""liberal fake news CNN's fake Jake Tapper"" and mocked his ratings.<ref name="":23"" /><ref name="":22"" />  ==== ''The New York Times'' ==== In July 2017, a report by Fox & Friends falsely said ''The New York Times'' had disclosed intelligence in one of its stories and that this intelligence disclosure helped Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, to evade capture.<ref name="":9""><br /> <br /> </ref> The report cited an inaccurate assertion by Gen. Tony Thomas, the head of the United States Special Operations Command, that a major newspaper had disclosed the intelligence.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10""></ref> Fox News said it was the ''New York Times'', repeatedly running the chyron ""NYT FOILS U.S. ATTEMPT TO TAKE OUT AL-BAHGDADI"".<ref name="":10"" /> [[Pete Hegseth , one of the show's hosts, criticized the ""failing New York Times"".<ref name="":10"" /> President Donald Trump tweeted about the Fox & Friends report shortly after it first aired, saying ""The Failing ''New York Times'' foiled U.S. attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist, Al-Baghdadi. Their sick agenda over National Security.""<ref name="":9"" /> Fox News later updated the story, but without apologizing to the ''New York Times'' or responding directly to the inaccuracies.<ref name="":10"" />  In a ''Washington Post'' column, Erik Wemple said Chris Wallace had covered ''The New York Times'' story himself on ''Fox News Sunday''. ""Here's another case of the differing standards between Fox News's opinion operation"", which has given ""a state-run vibe on all matters related to Trump"", compared to Fox News's news operation, which has provided ""mostly sane coverage.""  ===Climate change=== According to the fact-checking website [[Climate Feedback , Fox News is part of ""a network of unreliable outlets for climate news."" A 2011 study found Fox News ""takes a more dismissive tone toward climate change than CNN and MSNBC"".<ref name="":8""></ref> A 2008 study found Fox News emphasized the scientific uncertainty of climate change more than CNN, was less likely to say climate change was real, and more likely to interview climate change skeptics.<ref name="":8"" />  In 2011, the hosts of Fox & Friends described climate change as ""unproven science"", a ""disputed fact"", and criticized the Department of Education for working together with Nickelodeon to teach children about climate change.  In 2001, Sean Hannity described the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus on climate change  as ""phony science from the left.""<ref name="":182""></ref> In 2004, he falsely alleged, ""scientists still can't agree on whether the global warming is scientific fact or fiction"".<ref name="":182"" /> In 2010, Hannity said the so-called [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy|""Climategate""  – the leaking of e-mails by climate scientist that climate change skeptics claimed demonstrated scientific misconduct but which all subsequent enquiries have found no evidence of misconduct or wrongdoing –  a ""scandal"" that ""exposed global warming as a myth cooked up by alarmists."" Hannity frequently invites contrarian fringe scientists and critics of climate change to his shows.  [[Shepard Smith  has drawn attention for being one of few voices on Fox News to forcefully state that climate change is real, that human activities are a primary contributor to it and that there is a [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus  on the issue. His acceptance of the scientific consensus on climate change has drawn criticism from Fox News viewers and conservatives.  === Murder of Seth Rich conspiracy ===  On May 16, 2017, a day when other news organizations were extensively covering [[Donald Trump revelation of classified information to Russia|Donald Trump's revelation of classified information to Russia ,<ref name="":4""></ref> Fox News ran a lead story about a private investigator's uncorroborated claims about the [[murder of Seth Rich , a [[Democratic National Committee|DNC  staffer.<ref name="":3""></ref><ref name="":5""></ref><ref name="":6""></ref> The private investigator said he had uncovered evidence that Rich was in contact with Wikileaks and law enforcement were covering it up.<ref name="":3"" /> The killing of Rich has given rise to conspiracy theories in rightwing circles that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party had Seth Rich killed allegedly because he was the source of the [[DNC leaks .<ref name="":3"" /> U.S. intelligence agencies determined Russia was the source of the leaks. In reporting the investigator's claims, the Fox News report reignited right-wing conspiracy theories about the killing.<ref name="":3"" /><ref name="":6"" />  The Fox News story fell apart within hours.<ref name="":11""></ref> Other news organizations quickly revealed the investigator was a Donald Trump supporter and had according to ''NBC News'' ""developed a reputation for making outlandish claims, such as&nbsp;one appearance&nbsp;on Fox News in 2007 in which he warned that underground networks of pink pistol-toting lesbian gangs were raping young women.""<ref name="":3"" /><ref name="":02""></ref> The family of Seth Rich, the Washington, D.C.police department, the Washington, D.C. mayor's office, the FBI, and law enforcement sources familiar with the case, rebuked the investigator's claims.<ref name="":3"" /><ref name="":5"" /> The family said, ""We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers.""<ref name="":3"" /> The spokesperson for the family criticized Fox News for its reporting, alleging the outlet was motivated by a desire to deflect attention from the Trump-Russia story: ""I think there's a very special place in hell for people that would use the memory of a murder victim in order to pursue a political agenda.""<ref name="":4"" /> The family has called for retractions and apologies from Fox News for the inaccurate reporting.<ref name="":02""/> Over the course of the day, Fox News altered the contents of the story and the headline, but did not issue corrections.<ref name="":02""/>&nbsp;When CNN contacted the private investigator later that day, the investigator said he had no evidence that Rich had contacted Wikileaks.<ref name="":6"" /> The investigator claimed he only learned about the possible existence&nbsp;of the evidence from a Fox News reporter.<ref name="":6"" /> Fox News did not respond to inquiries by CNN, and the Washington Post.<ref name="":6"" /><ref name="":5"" /> Fox News later on 23 May, seven days after the story was published, retracted its original report, saying the original report did not meet its standards.<ref name="":11"" />  Nicole Hemmer, assistant professor at the&nbsp;[[Miller Center of Public Affairs , wrote that the promotion of the conspiracy theory demonstrated how Fox News was ""remaking itself in the image of fringe media in the age of Trump, blurring the lines between real and fake news."" Max Boot of the [[Council on Foreign Relations  said while intent behind Fox News, as a counterweight to the liberal media was laudable, the culmination of those efforts have been to create an alternative news source that promotes hoaxes and myths, of which the promotion of the Seth Rich conspiracy is an example. Fox News was also criticized by conservative outlets, such as the ''Weekly Standard'', ''National Review'', and conservative columnists, such as Jennifer Rubin, Michael Gerson, and John Podhoretz.  === Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville === Various Fox News hosts and contributors defended Trump's remarks that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence at a gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia.<ref name="":2""></ref><ref name="":12""></ref> Some criticized Trump.<ref name="":7""></ref><ref name="":12"" /> In a press conference on August 15, Trump used the term ""alt-left"" to describe counterprotesters at the white supremacist rally, a term which had been used in Fox News' coverage of the white supremacist rally.<ref name="":2"" /> Several of Trump's comments at the press conference mirrored those appearing earlier on Fox News.  According to [[Dylan Byers  of CNN, Fox News' coverage on the day of the press conference ""was heavy with ""[[whataboutism "". The average Fox viewer was likely left with the impression that the media's criticism of Trump and leftist protestors' toppling of some Confederate statues were far greater threats to America than white supremacism or the president's apparent defense of bigotry.""<ref name="":7"" /> Byers wrote, ""it showed that if Fox News has a line when it comes to Trump's presidency, it was not crossed on Tuesday.""<ref name="":7"" />  === Glenn Beck's comments about George Soros === During Glenn Beck's tenure at Fox News, he became one of the most high-profile proponents of [[George Soros#Conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories about George Soros , a Jewish Hungarian-American businessman and philanthropist known for his donations to [[Modern liberalism in the United States|American liberal  political causes.<ref name="":37""></ref> Beck regularly described Soros as a ""puppet-master"" and used common anti-Semitic tropes to refer to Soros and his activities.<ref name="":37"" /> In a 2010 three-part series, Beck depicted George Soros as a cartoonish villain trying to ""form a shadow government, using humanitarian aid as a cover,"" and that Soros wanted a one-world government.<ref name="":38""></ref><ref name="":39""></ref> Beck promoted the false and anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Soros was a Nazi collaborator as a 14-year old in Nazi-occupied Hungary. Beck also characterized Soros's mother as a ""wildly anti-Semitic"" Nazi collaborator.<ref name="":38"" /> According to ''The Washington Post'', ""Beck's series was largely considered obscene and delusional, if not outright anti-Semitic"", but Beck's conspiracy theory became popular on the rightwing of American politics.<ref name="":38"" /> Amid criticism of Beck's false smears, Fox News defended Beck, stating ""information regarding Mr. Soros's experiences growing up were taken directly from his writings and from interviews given by him to the media, and no negative opinion was offered as to his actions as a child.""<ref name="":39"" /> Roger Ailes, then-head of Fox News, dismissed criticism levied at Beck by hundreds of rabbis, saying that they were ""left-wing rabbis who basically don't think that anybody can ever use the word, Holocaust, on the air.""  ==Controversies== <!--SEE TALK PAGE BEFORE ADDING ANYTHING RELATED TO FNC'S POSSIBLE EDITS TO WIKIPEDIA-->     ===Sexual harassment=== The network has been accused of permitting [[sexual harassment  and [[Racism|racial discrimination  by on-air hosts, executives, and employees, paying out millions of dollars in legal settlements. Prominent Fox News figures such as Roger Ailes, Bill O'Reilly and Eric Bolling were eventually fired after a multitude of women accused them of sexual harassment. At least four lawsuits alleged Fox News co-president [[Bill Shine  ignored, enabled or concealed Roger Ailes' alleged sexual harassment.<ref name="":52""></ref><ref name="":82""></ref> Fox News CEO Rupert Murdoch has dismissed the high-profile sexual misconduct allegations as ""largely political"" and speculated they were made ""because we are conservative"".  Bill O'Reilly and Fox News settled six agreements, totaling $45 million, with women who accused O'Reilly of sexual harassment.<ref name="":17""></ref> In January 2017, shortly after Bill O'Reilly settled a sexual harassment lawsuit for $32 million  ""an extraordinarily large amount for such cases"" , Fox News renewed Bill O'Reilly's contract.<ref name="":17"" /> Fox News's parent company, 21st Century Fox, said it was aware of the lawsuit.<ref name="":17"" /> The contract between O'Reilly and Fox News read he could not be fired from the network unless sexual harassment allegations were proved in court.  Fox News's extensive coverage of the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|Harvey Weinstein scandal  in October 2017 was seen by some as hypocritical.<ref name=""Axios""></ref><ref name="":18""></ref> Fox News dedicated at least 12 hours of coverage to the Weinstein scandal, yet only dedicated 20 minutes to Bill O'Reilly, who just like Weinstein had been accused of sexual harassment by a multitude of women.<ref name=""Axios"" /><ref name="":18"" /> Indira Lakshmana, an expert in journalism ethics at the Poynter Institute, said ""to devote hours of airtime to crowing about Weinstein's well-deserved downfall because of his liberal politics, while ignoring the massive, decades-long pattern of harassment by powerful men at Fox, is both hypocritical and sad"".<ref name="":18"" /> A few weeks later, when a number of women under the age of 18, including a 14-year old, accused Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of making sexual advances, Hannity dismissed the sexual misconduct allegations and dedicated coverage on his TV show to casting doubt on the accusers. Other prime-time Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham questioned the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post ''<nowiki/>'s reporting or opted to bring up sexual misconduct allegations regarding show business elites such as Harvey Weinstein and [[Louis C.K.|Louis C.K .<ref name="":25""></ref> Fox News figures [[Jeanine Pirro  and [[Gregg Jarrett  questioned both the validity of the ''Washington Post''<nowiki/>'s reporting and that of the women. In December 2017, a few days before the Alabama Senate election, Fox News, along with the conspiracy websites Breitbart and Gateway Pundit, ran an inaccurate headline which claimed one of Roy Moore's accusers admitted to forging an inscription by Roy Moore in her yearbook; Fox News later added a correction to the story.  A number of Fox News hosts have welcomed Bill O'Reilly to their shows and paid tributes to Roger Ailes after his death. In May 2017, Hannity called Ailes ""a second father"" and said to Ailes's ""enemies"" that he was ""preparing to kick your a** in the next life"".<ref name="":152""></ref> Ailes had the year before been fired from Fox News after a number of women alleged he sexually harassed them.<ref name="":152"" /> In September 2017, several months after Bill O'Reilly was fired from Fox News in the wake of a number of women alleging he sexually harassed them, Hannity hosted O'Reilly on his show.<ref name="":163""></ref> Some Fox News employees criticized the decision.<ref name="":163"" /> According to ''CNN'', during the interview, Hannity found kinship with O'Reilly as he appeared ""to feel that he and O'Reilly have both become victims of liberals looking to silence them.""<ref name="":163"" /> Earlier, Hannity had dedicated extensive coverage to the Weinstein scandal.<ref name="":42""></ref>  ===Obama administration conflict=== In September 2009, the [[Obama administration  engaged in a verbal conflict with Fox News Channel. On September 20, President [[Barack Obama  appeared on all major news programs except Fox News, a snub partially in response to remarks about him by commentators Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity, and Fox coverage of Obama's health-care proposal.<ref name=""usnews.com""></ref>  In late September 2009, Obama senior advisor [[David Axelrod  political consultant |David Axelrod  and Roger Ailes met in secret to attempt to smooth out tensions between the two camps. Two weeks later, chief of staff [[Rahm Emanuel  referred to FNC as ""not a news network"" and communications director [[Anita Dunn  said ""Fox News often operates as either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party"". Obama observed, ""If media is operating basically as a talk radio format, then that's one thing, and if it's operating as a news outlet, then that's another"". White House chief of staff [[Rahm Emanuel  said it was important ""to not have the CNNs and the others in the world basically be led in following Fox"".  Within days, it was reported that Fox had been excluded from an interview with administration official [[Ken Feinberg , with bureau chiefs from the White House press pool  ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN  coming to Fox's defense. A bureau chief said, ""If any member had been excluded it would have been the same thing, it has nothing to do with Fox or the White House or the substance of the issues"". Shortly after the story broke, the White House admitted to a low-level mistake, saying Fox had not made a specific request to interview Feinberg. Fox White House correspondent Major Garrett said he had not made a specific request, but had a ""standing request from me as senior White House correspondent on Fox to interview any newsmaker at the Treasury at any given time news is being made"".  On November 8, 2009, the ''[[Los Angeles Times '' reported an unnamed Democratic consultant was warned by the White House not to appear on Fox News again. According to the article, Anita Dunn claimed in an e-mail to have checked with colleagues who ""deal with TV issues"" who denied telling anyone to avoid Fox. [[Patrick Caddell , a Fox News contributor and former pollster for President [[Jimmy Carter , said he had spoken with other Democratic consultants who had received similar warnings from the White House.  On October 2, 2013, Fox News host [[Anna Kooiman  cited on the air a fake story from the ''National Report'' parody site, which claimed Obama had offered to keep the International Museum of Muslim Cultures open with cash from his own pocket.  === Journalistic ethical standards === Fox News attracted controversy in April 2018 when it was revealed primetime host Sean Hannity had defended [[Michael Cohen  lawyer |Michael Cohen  on air without disclosing that Cohen was Hannity's lawyer.<ref name=""No Disclosure? No Problem. Sean Hannity Gets a Pass at Fox News. – The New York Times""></ref> On April 9, 2018, federal agents from the [[U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York|U.S. Attorney's office  served a search warrant on the office and residence of  [[Michael Cohen  lawyer |Michael Cohen , Trump's personal attorney. On the air, Hannity defended Cohen and criticized the federal action, calling it ""highly questionable"" and ""an unprecedented abuse of power"".<ref name=""Winter""></ref> On April 16, 2018 in a court hearing, Cohen's lawyers told the judge that Cohen had ten clients in 2017–2018 but did ""traditional legal tasks"" for only three: Trump, [[Elliott Broidy , and a ""prominent person"" who did not wish to be named for fear of being ""embarrassed"".<ref name=""Miller""></ref>  The federal judge ordered the revelation of the third client, whom Cohen's lawyers named as Hannity.<ref name=""Miller"" />  Hannity was not sanctioned by Fox News for this breach of journalistic ethics, with Fox News releasing a statement that the channel was unaware of Hannity's relationship to Cohen and that it had ""spoken to Sean and he continues to have our full support.""<ref name=""No Disclosure? No Problem. Sean Hannity Gets a Pass at Fox News. – The New York Times"" /><ref name=""cohenCNBC""></ref> Media ethics experts said that Hannity's failure to disclose was a major breach of journalistic ethics and that the network should have suspended or fired him for it.<ref name=""cohenCNBC"" />  ==International transmission== [[File:Fox News World Providers Map.svg|thumb|Countries where Fox News is provided|alt=World map, with countries carrying terrestrial FNC in red and satellite providers in orange  The Fox News Channel feed is available internationally via a number of providers, while ''Fox Extra'' segments provide alternate programming.  ===''Fox Extra''=== Initially, U.S. advertisements were replaced on FNC with viewer e-mail and profiles of FNC anchors set to music. In 2002, these were replaced with international weather forecasts. In 2006, the weather forecasts were replaced with ''Fox Extra''  originally ''Fox News Extra'', prior to the international launch of [[Fox Business   segments, narrated reports from Fox on a variety of topics. These reports generally concern lighter issues unrelated to current news events, and the segments are repeated. FNC also shows international weather forecasts when ''Fox Extra'' segments run short. In the United Kingdom, after a period when local commercials were inserted into breaks, ''Fox Extra'' now fills most breaks.  ===Australia=== In Australia, FNC is broadcast on the dominant pay television provider [[Foxtel , which is 50% owned by [[News Corp Australia , the Australian arm of [[News Corp  and the sister company of [[21st Century Fox  which owns FNC. Local cable news channel [[Sky News Australia  is wholly owned by News Corp Australia and is therefore FNC's de facto sister channel, although has formal partnerships with FNC competitor [[CNN  as well as both [[ABC News  and [[CBS News .<ref name=CMHacq></ref>  ===Brazil=== Since 2002, FNC has been broadcast to Brazil; however, commercials are replaced with ''Fox Extra''. It is available in packages of [[Vivo TV .  ===Canada=== Fox had initially planned to launch a joint venture with [[Canwest 's  [[Global Television Network , tentatively named Fox News Canada, which would have featured a mixture of U.S. and [[Canadian content|Canadian  news programming. As a result, the [[CRTC  denied a 2003 application requesting permission for Fox News Channel to be [[List of foreign television channels available in Canada|carried in Canada . However, in March 2004, a Fox executive said the venture had been shelved; in November of that year, the CRTC authorized Fox News Channel to be distributed by Canadian cable and satellite providers.  ===France=== Fox News is available on cable through French Internet provider [[Free  ISP |Free  on Canal 352. As of Spring 2017, the channel was no longer found on the provider Orange's lineup.  ===Indonesia=== In [[Indonesia , It is available in Channel 335 in pay TV provider [[Indovision .  ===Ireland=== Broadcast of FNC in the [[Republic of Ireland  ended in September 2017. Fox News was formerly carried by [[Sky plc|Sky .<ref name=""skydrop""></ref>  ===Israel=== In [[Israel , FNC is broadcast on Channel 105 of the satellite provider [[yes  Israel |Yes , as well as being carried on Cellcom TV and Partner TV. It is also broadcast on channel 200 on cable operator [[HOT  Israel |HOT .  ===Italy=== In Italy, FNC is broadcast on [[SKY Italia . Fox news was launched on [[Stream TV  in 2001, and moved to [[SKY Italia  in 2003.  ===Netherlands=== In the Netherlands, Fox News has been carried by cable providers [[UPC Nederland  and CASEMA, and satellite provider [[Canaldigitaal ; all have dropped the channel in recent years. At this time, only cable provider Caiway  available in a limited number of towns in the central part of the country  is broadcasting the channel. The channel is also carried by IPTV provider KNIPPR.  ===New Zealand=== In New Zealand, FNC is broadcast on Channel 088 of pay satellite operator [[SKY Network Television 's digital platform. It was formerly broadcast overnight on free-to-air [[Ultra high frequency|UHF  New Zealand TV channel [[Prime Television  New Zealand |Prime   owned by SKY ; this was discontinued in January 2010, reportedly due to an expiring broadcasting license. Fox News' former parent company News Corporation has a stake in both SKY and Prime.  ===Pakistan=== In Pakistan, Fox News Channel is available on [[PTCL Smart TV  and a number of cable and [[IPTV  operators.  ===Philippines=== In the [[Philippines , Fox News Channel was available on [[Cignal Digital TV  channel 131 and [[G Sat  Channel 50.  ===Scandinavia=== Between 2003 and 2006, in Sweden and the other [[Scandinavian countries , FNC was broadcast 16 hours a day on [[TV8  Sweden |TV8   with ''Fox News Extra'' segments replacing U.S. advertising . Fox News was dropped by TV8 and replaced by German news channel [[Deutsche Welle  in September 2006.  ===Singapore=== In [[Singapore , FNC is broadcast on channel 702 on pay cable operator [[StarHub TV  digital platform. It also broadcasts its sister channel, [[Sky News .  ===South Africa=== In [[South Africa , FNC is broadcast on channel 261 of pay satellite operator [[StarSat, South Africa|StarSat's  digital platform.  The most popular pay television operator, [[DStv , does not offer FNC in its channel bouquet.  ===United Kingdom=== FNC was also carried in the [[Television in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom  by [[Sky  UK and Ireland |Sky , which was 40-percent owned by 21st Century Fox at the time, and operates its own domestic news channel [[Sky News . On August 29, 2017, Sky dropped Fox News; the broadcaster said its carriage was not ""commercially viable"" due to average viewership of fewer than 2,000 viewers per day. The company said the decision was unrelated to 21st Century Fox's proposed acquisition of the remainder of [[Sky plc   which ultimately led to a bidding war that resulted in its acquisition by [[Comcast  instead . The potential co-ownership had prompted concerns from critics of the deal, who felt Sky News could undergo a shift to an opinionated format with a right-wing viewpoint, similar to Fox News; the channel has violated the [[Ofcom  codes a number of times, including broadcasting analysis of the [[Brexit  vote while polls were still open  a violation of British election laws; the channel was blocked while polls were open during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election  to comply with these rules , and various violations of a requirement for all news programming to show due impartiality.  ===Other countries=== Fox News is carried in more than 40 other countries. Although service to Japan ceased in summer 2003, it can still be seen on Americable  distributor for [[United States Forces Japan|American bases  , Mediatti  [[Kadena Air Base   and Pan Global TV Japan.  ==Notable personalities==  ===Program hosts===  * [[Bret Baier  * [[Maria Bartiromo  * [[Shannon Bream  * [[Tucker Carlson  * [[Neil Cavuto  * [[Steve Doocy  * [[Ainsley Earhardt  * [[Harris Faulkner  * [[Melissa Francis  * [[Greg Gutfeld  * [[Sean Hannity  * [[Pete Hegseth  * [[Bill Hemmer  * [[Steve Hilton  * [[Laura Ingraham  * [[Kennedy  commentator |Kennedy  * [[Brian Kilmeade  * [[Howard Kurtz  * [[Harvey Levin  * [[Mark Levin  * [[Martha MacCallum  * [[Arthel Neville  * [[Uma Pemmaraju  * [[Dana Perino  * [[Jeanine Pirro  * [[Elizabeth Prann  * [[Jon Scott  * [[Eric Shawn  * [[Sandra Smith  reporter |Sandra Smith  * [[Shepard Smith  * [[Leland Vittert  * [[Chris Wallace  journalist |Chris Wallace  * [[Jesse Watters  * [[Juan Williams    ===Correspondents and substitute anchors===  * Dr. [[Manny Alvarez  * [[Ellison Barber  * [[Heather Childers  * [[Patti Ann Browne  * [[Christine Clayburg  * [[Claudia Cowan  * [[Janice Dean  * [[Peter Doocy  * [[Mike Emanuel  * [[Kristin Fisher  * [[Lea Gabrielle  * [[Trace Gallagher  * [[Anna Gilligan  * [[Lauren Green  * [[Jennifer Griffin  * [[Molly Henneberg  * [[Catherine Herridge  * [[Brit Hume  * [[Phil Keating  * [[Rick Leventhal  * [[Molly Line  * [[Dagen McDowell  * [[Hollie McKay  * [[Andrew Napolitano  * [[Kate Obenshain  * [[Charles Payne  journalist |Charles Payne  * [[Katie Pavlich  * [[Geraldo Rivera  * [[John Roberts  journalist |John Roberts  * [[Eric Shawn  * Dr. [[Marc Siegel    ===Regular guests and contributors===  * Dr. [[Keith Ablow  * [[Mike Baker  CIA officer |Mike Baker  * [[Guy Benson  * [[Jedediah Bila  * [[Tammy Bruce  * [[Patrick Caddell|Pat Caddell  * [[Herman Cain  * Rep.

It is owned by the Fox News Group, which itself was owned by News Corporation from 1996–2013, 21st Century Fox from 2013–2019, and Fox Corporation since 2019. The channel broadcasts primarily from studios at 1211 Avenue of the Americas in New York City. Fox News is provided in 86 countries or overseas territories worldwide, with international broadcasts featuring Fox Extra segments during ad breaks. The channel was created by Australian-American media mogul Rupert Murdoch to appeal to a conservative audience, hiring former Republican Party media consultant and CNBC executive Roger Ailes as its founding CEO. It launched on October 7, 1996, to 17 million cable subscribers. Fox News grew during the late 1990s and 2000s to become the dominant subscription news network in the US. As of February 2015, approximately 94,700,000 US households  81.4% of television subscribers  receive Fox News. Murdoch is the current executive chairman and Suzanne Scott is the CEO.Fox News has been described as practicing biased reporting in favor of the Republican Party, the George W. Bush and Donald Trump administrations and conservative causes while slandering the Democratic Party and spreading harmful propaganda intended to negatively affect its members' electoral performances. Critics have cited the channel as detrimental to the integrity of news overall. Fox News employees have said that news reporting operates independently of its opinion and commentary programming, and have denied bias in news reporting, while former employees have said that Fox ordered them to ""slant the news in favor of conservatives."""

''Deadspin''s last post each evening, tagged ''DUAN''  ""Deadspin Up All Night"" , is infamous for its occasionally viral and usually wildly diverse commentaries.  ==History== ''Deadspin''s founding editor-in-chief was [[Will Leitch , author and a founding editor of the [[New York City –based culture website, ""The Black Table"". Leitch announced on June 5, 2008 that he would be leaving to take a position at [[New York  magazine |''New York'' magazine . He was replaced by A. J. Daulerio, former senior writer for the site. Author and journalist [[Drew Magary , formerly a frequent contributor to the site's comments section, has served as an editor and chief columnist since 2008.   ''[[Time  magazine |Time '' magazine named the site one of the 50 coolest websites of 2006.

The current masthead consists of editor-in-chief Megan Greenwell, deputy editor Barry Petchesky, managing editor [[Tom Ley , senior editor Diana Moskovitz, along with a staff of full-time writers and regular contributors.  ==Reporting== ''Deadspin'' broke the story of NFL quarterback [[Brett Favre 's [[Brett Favre#Allegations of misconduct|alleged sexual misconduct  toward journalist [[Jenn Sterger .  ''Deadspin'' broke the story of Sarah Phillips, a reporter hired by ESPN who lied about her identity and credentials to staffers in order to gain employment.  ''Deadspin'' broke the news that the reported September 2012 death of the girlfriend of [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame  All-American linebacker [[Manti Te'o , which Te'o had said inspired him during the [[2012 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|2012 season , was apparently a hoax. ''Deadspin'' found no evidence that the girlfriend had ever existed, much less died.<ref name=ESPNM></ref>  ''Deadspin'' received attention for ""buying"" a vote for the [[Baseball Hall of Fame  election in 2013. The site announced in late November 2013 that it had acquired a vote from a [[BBWAA  writer which was ""purchased"" not through a cash payment to the writer, but instead to a charity of the writer's choice. On January 8, after the Hall of Fame voting was announced, ''Deadspin'' revealed that its voter was ''[[Miami Herald '' sportswriter [[Dan Le Batard . Le Batard was heavily criticized by fellow sportswriters for ""selling"" his vote. The BBWAA permanently revoked his Hall of Fame voting privileges and suspended his membership for one year.  On October 15, 2014, ''Deadspin'' published an article which alleged that Cory Gardner, the Republican who ran for senate in Colorado, had faked his high school football career. Later that day, Gardner tweeted photographic evidence of himself in his football uniform as a teenager, and the main source of the story said the report mischaracterized his comments.<ref name=DenverPost></ref> ''Deadspin'' updated the article with an editor's note which stated the correct information.<ref name=LegalIns></ref><ref name=WaPo></ref> Republican-aligned blog ''[[The Washington Free Beacon '' criticized the article as a ""politically-motivated hit.""<ref name=FreeBeacon></ref>  After ''Deadspin'' posted an article asking readers to post proof of [[Ted Cruz  playing basketball, the Senator responded by jokingly tweeting a picture of Duke star [[Grayson Allen , which then prompted ''Deadspin'' to reply with ""Go eat shit.""

The Popular Mechanics Company was owned by the Windsor family and printed in Chicago until the [[Hearst Corporation  purchased the magazine in 1958. In 1962, the editorial offices moved to New York City.  From the first issue, the magazine featured a large illustration of a technological subject, a look that evolved into the magazine's characteristic full-page, full-color illustration and a small 6.5"" x 9.5"" trim size beginning with the July, 1911 issue. It maintained the small format until 1975 when it switched the larger standard trim size. ''Popular Science'' adopted full-color cover illustrations in 1915, and the look was widely imitated by later technology magazines.  Several international editions were introduced after World War II, starting with a French edition, followed by Spanish in 1947, and Swedish and Danish in 1949. In 2002, the print magazine was being published in English, Chinese, and Spanish and distributed worldwide. South African and Russian editions were introduced that same year.  Notable articles have been contributed by notable people including Guglielmo Marconi, Thomas Edison, Jules Verne, Barney Oldfield, Knute Rockne, Winston Churchill, Charles Kettering, Tom Wolfe, and Buzz Aldrin, as well as many presidents including Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. Comedian and car expert Jay Leno had a regular column, ''Jay Leno's Garage,'' starting in March, 1999.  == Editors == {| class=""wikitable"" |+Editors* !Name !Dates |- |Henry Haven Windsor |Jan 1902 - Jun 1924 |- |Henry Haven Windsor Jr |Jul 1924 - Dec 1958 |- |Roderick Grant |Jan 1959 - Dec 1960 |- |Clifford Hicks |Jan 1961 - Sep 1962 |- |Don Dinwiddie |Oct 1962 - Sep 1965 |- |Robert Crosley |Jul 1966 - Dec 1971 |- |Jim Liston |Jan 1972 - Dec 1974 |- |John Linkletter |Jan 1975 - Jun 1985 |- |Joe Oldham |Aug 1985 - Sep 2004 |- |Jim Meigs |Oct 2004 - April 2014 |- |Ryan D'Agostino |May 2014 -  |} <nowiki>*</nowiki>Note that in general, dates are the inclusive issues for which an editor was responsible.

She began developing an online news site while still a student and she and Scheer launched Truthdig the year she graduated and right after Scheer was pushed out of the ''[[Los Angeles Times ''.  Kaufman and Scheer insist on high journalistic standards and their team is composed of writers and editors from the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times '', ''Los Angeles Times'', ''[[San Francisco Chronicle '', ''[[New York Daily News '', and other major publications. Their goal is to create a home for provocative and talented writers and to give them the freedom to pursue a story wherever it takes them. At the time, it was said no one would read long stories on the Internet. Kaufman begged to differ and set up a site featuring substantial reporting of important issues.  The site is not influenced by advertisers or shareholders and is not controlled by any outside entity.  == Contributors == Significant contributors include [[Noam Chomsky , [[Juan Cole , [[Gore Vidal , [[Sam Harris , [[Chris Hedges , [[Amy Goodman , [[Greg Palast , [[Carrie Rickey , and animator [[Mark Fiore .<!-- If possible, please include a reliable, independent source, thanks. -->  In October 2006, Truthdig published a 660-word essay titled ""After Pat's Birthday"" about NFL player and American soldier [[Pat Tillman 's death written by his brother Kevin. The essay was widely distributed and was cited in ''[[The New York Times '' and the [[Associated Press .  On the tenth anniversary of the [[Iraq War , Truthdig published ""The Last Letter"" by [[Tomas Young , a veteran paralyzed in Iraq, in which he addresses [[George W. Bush  and [[Dick Cheney  and condemns them as war criminals. The letter, written as Young awaits his death under hospice care, was translated into several languages and printed worldwide.  == Communication studies == Truthdig has been used as a data source in [[communication studies  research on systematic differences in coverage of political events by [[alternative media   such as Truthdig  versus [[mainstream media . Truthdig has also been included in a set of news sources subjected to statistical analysis intended to identify credible sources.  == Awards == As of October 2017, Truthdig has won six [[Webby Award s, including four regular Webbys and two Webby People's Voice Awards. In 2007, it won both a regular Webby and a Webby People's Voice Award. At the 2010 ceremony for the Webby Awards, which traditionally limit acceptance speeches to five words, Robert Scheer accepted on behalf of Truthdig, saying: ""Wall Street—what fucking thieves.""  Truthdig and its individual journalists have won numerous awards from the [[Los Angeles Press Club , including 11 Southern California  SoCal  Journalism Awards in 2017, three in 2013, and five in 2010.

In a 2015 interview, former [[editor-in-chief  [[John Avlon  described ''The Beast''s editorial approach: ""We seek out scoops, scandals, and stories about secret worlds; we love confronting bullies, bigots, and hypocrites."" In 2018, Avlon described the ''Beast''s ""Strike Zone"" as ""politics, pop culture and power.""  ==History== ''The Daily Beast'' began publishing on October 6, 2008. ''The Beast''s founding editor was [[Tina Brown , a former editor of [[Vanity Fair  magazine |''Vanity Fair''  and ''[[The New Yorker '' as well as the short-lived ''[[Talk  magazine |Talk '' magazine. Brown stepped down as editor in September 2013. [[John Avlon , an American journalist and political commentator as well as a [[CNN  contributor, was the site's editor-in-chief and managing director from 2013 to 2018. The name of the site was taken from a fictional newspaper in [[Evelyn Waugh 's novel [[Scoop  novel |''Scoop'' .  In 2010, ''The Daily Beast'' merged with the magazine ''[[Newsweek '' creating a combined company, [[The Newsweek Daily Beast Company . The merger ended in 2013, when ''Daily Beast'' owner [[IAC  company |IAC  sold ''Newsweek'' to IBT Media, owner of the ''[[International Business Times ''.  In September 2014, ''The Daily Beast'' reached a new record of 21 million unique visitors—a 60% year-over-year increase in readers, accompanied by a 300% increase in the overall size of its social media community.  In May 2018 Avlon departed from the ''Beast'' to become full-time Senior Political Analyst and anchor at CNN. Avlon was succeeded by executive editor [[Noah Shachtman .  In March 2017 former chief strategy and product officer Mike Dyer left for [[Intel . In May 2017, Heather Dietrick was appointed president and publisher.  ==Editorial stance== In an April 2018 interview, Avlon described the publication's political stance as ""nonpartisan but not neutral"": ""what that means is we’re going to hit both sides where appropriate, but we're not going for mythic moral equivalence on every issue."" In April 2017 Avlon discussed the organization's approach on the [[Poynter Institute 's podcast saying, ""We're not going to toe any partisan line."" In December 2017 [[NPR  reported about ''The Daily Beast''s bipartisan approach to its political reporting. Editor-in-Chief John Avlon began pairing reporters from both the right and left sides to cover stories on the White House. In particular, they are using both Asawin Suebsaeng  formerly of ''[[Mother Jones  magazine |Mother Jones ''  and Lachlan Markay  formerly of the [[Heritage Foundation   to file stories on the [[Trump Administration . Avlon commented about the approach saying, ""We're nonpartisan, but not neutral. And so bringing these two perspectives together, I think, helps us stand out from the pack.""  Executive Editor Noah Shachtman describes the editorial style as ""some of the spirit of the old school New York tabloid and match it with the pace of digital journalism,"" Shachtman continues, ""What we did is really put an emphasis on scoop, scoop, scoop...That has really combined for what I think is the best read on the net.""  ''[[The Washington Post '' Media Critic [[Erik Wemple  described the ''Beast''s direction, ""Pound for pound, it is an impressive operation. As I see it, they do a few things well: they bang the phones, they don't always follow the same story everyone else is doing and they are fast.""  The illustrational style created by Director of Photography Sarah Rogers and used at the top of every article has been described as, ""jaunty collage and pop-art illustrations"".  ==Format== A feature of ''The Daily Beast'' is the ""Cheat Sheet"", billed as ""must reads from all over"". Published throughout the day, the Cheat Sheet offers a selection of articles from online news outlets on popular stories. The Cheat Sheet includes brief summaries of the article, and a link to read the full text of the article on the website of its provider.  After the launch, the site introduced additional sections, including a video Cheat Sheet and Book Beast.<ref name=""mediabistro""></ref> The site frequently creates encyclopedic landing pages on topical subjects such as [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|President Obama's inauguration , the [[Bernard Madoff  [[Ponzi scheme , [[Michael Jackson , the Iran uprising, and the [[US Open  tennis |US Open . In 2014, ''The Daily Beast'' became majority mobile and released an iOS app, which Nieman Lab described as ""the dawn of the quantified news reader"".  == Contributors == Contributors to the publication include notable writers and political activists such as [[Ana Marie Cox , [[P. J. O'Rourke , [[Maajid Nawaz , [[Olivia Nuzzi , [[Mike Barnicle , [[Noah Shachtman , [[Michael Tomasky , [[David Frum , [[Stuart Stevens , [[Meghan McCain , [[Peter Beinart , [[Jon Favreau  speechwriter |Jon Favreau , [[Kirsten Powers , Erin Gloria Ryan, [[Daniel Gross , [[Michael C.

In July 2016 influential food critic [[Mimi Sheraton  was added. In May 2017 Pulitzer Prize-winning national security reporter Spencer Ackerman left the Guardian and joined ''The Daily Beast''. When asked about the move Ackerman said, ""''The Daily Beast'' is the place to do the kind of journalism that matters most right now..."" In June 2017 [[Huffington Post  Senior Political Editor Sam Stein announced he is joining ''The Daily Beast'' in the same capacity.  ==Popularity== In early June 2014, Capital New York re-published a memo by outgoing CEO Rhona Murphy, stating that ''The Daily Beast''s average unique monthly visitors increased from 13.5 million in 2013 to more than 17 million in 2014.<ref name=""Capital New York""></ref> By September 2014 the website reached a new record of 21 million unique visitors; it was a 60% year-over-year increase in readers, accompanied by a 300% increase in the overall size of its social media community.  In 2015, Ken Doctor, a news analyst for Nieman Lab, reported  that ''The Daily Beast'' is ""one of the fastest-growing news and information sites year-over-year in the 'General News' category"".  During Avlon's leadership The Daily Beast doubled its traffic to 1.1 million readers a day and won over 17 awards for journalistic excellence.    In a 2017 interview George Clooney complimented the organization's development stating, ""I really do love what you guys are doing over there, you've stepped up the game considerably from when it started, and it's fun to watch.""  ==Awards== ''The Daily Beast'' won a [[Webby Award  for ""Best News Site"" in 2012 and 2013. Also in 2012 John Avlon won National Society of Newspaper Columnists' award for best online column in 2012 for ''The Daily Beast''.  In March 2012 ""Book Beast,"" won a National Magazine Award for Website Department, which ""Honors a department, channel or microsite.""  Anna Nemstova received the Courage in Journalism Award in 2015 from the [[International Women's Media Foundation . Also that year, Michael Daly won with the National Society of Newspaper Columnists award in the category of Online, Blog, Multimedia – Over 100,000 Unique Visitors.  In 2016 The Los Angeles Press Club nominated several of The Beast's writers including M.L. Nestel for Arts/Entertainment Investigative, Brandy Zadrozny and Ben Collins for best Celebrity Investigative, Malcolm Jones for best Obituary, Lizzie Crocker for Humor and Tim Teeman for Industry/ArtsHard News. Also nominated for best in field were Kevin Fallon for Industry/Arts Soft News and Melissa Leon for Industry/Arts Soft News.

In 2017 NLGJA awarded Jay Michaelson for his coverage of GOP Anti-LGBT legislation and Tim Teeman for reporting on ALS.  In 2017 the website won three New York Press Club Journalism Awards in the internet publishing categories of Entertainment News, Crime Reporting and Travel Reporting. In December the Los Angeles Press Club's National Arts and Entertainment Journalism Awards announced the platform had won 4 awards for 2017 reporting including investigative articles about the [[Nate Parker  rape case, Comic [[Bob Smith  comedian |Bob Smith 's struggle with ALS and remembering [[Bill Paxton .  In 2018 the trade magazine ''[[Digiday '' awarded the ''Beast''s Cheet Sheet for best email newsletter.  ==Beast Books== In September 2009, ''The Daily Beast'' launched a publishing initiative entitled ""Beast Books"" that will produce books by ''Beast'' writers on an accelerated publishing schedule.<ref name=""NYTimes""></ref> The first book published by Beast Books was [[John Avlon 's ''Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe is Hijacking America''.  In January 2011 they published [[Stephen L. Carter 's ''The Violence of Peace: America's Wars in the Age of Obama''. Also in 2011 Beast Books published Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Leymah Gbowee ’s memoir, ''Mighty Be Our Powers''.  ==Controversies==  ===Plagiarism=== In February 2010, [[Jack Shafer  of [[Slate  magazine |Slate.com  claimed that the chief investigative reporter for ''The Daily Beast'', [[Gerald Posner , had plagiarised five sentences from an article published on the ''[[Miami Herald ''. Shafer also discovered that Posner had plagiarized content from a ''Miami Herald'' blog, a ''Miami Herald'' editorial, ''Texas Lawyer'' magazine and a health care journalism blog. Posner was subsequently dismissed from ''The Daily Beast'' following an internal review.  ===Taliban denouncement=== A 2013 article about the Taliban seeking peaceful negotiations in Afghanistan prompted a direct response from the organization. The Taliban denounced the article as false and claimed The Daily Beast violated the basic principles of journalism.  ===Nico Hines' 2016 Olympics article=== On August 11, 2016, ''The Daily Beast'' published an article titled ""I Got Three Grindr Dates in an Hour in the Olympic Village"", written by Nico Hines, the site's London editor, who was assigned to cover the Olympic Games.<ref name=""I Learned""></ref> Hines, a [[heterosexual  married man, signed up for several gay and straight dating apps, including [[Tinder  app |Tinder , [[Bumble  app |Bumble  and [[Grindr , and documented his experiences in the Olympic Village. While not specifically naming names, Hines provided enough detail in the article to identify individual athletes, leading to widespread criticism that this information could be used against [[closeted  gay athletes, especially those living in repressive countries. Facing intense backlash online, ''The Daily Beast'' edited the piece to remove details that could allow athletes to be identified, and editor in chief [[John Avlon  added a lengthy editor's note. Criticism challenging the value of the piece continued, and ''The Daily Beast'' eventually removed the article altogether and issued an apology. In March 2017, Hines issued a formal apology for his actions, and it was announced by the website's editor Hines would be returning to ''The Daily Beast'' ""following a lengthy period of intense reflection"".<ref name=""I Learned"" />  Andrew M. Seaman, ethics committee chair for the [[Society of Professional Journalists , called the article ""journalistic trash, unethical and dangerous"". The [[National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association  stated ""The reporting was unethical, extremely careless of individual privacy and potentially dangerous to the athletes"".<ref name=""LATimes1"">s Grindr-baiting story |last1=Maltais |first1=Michelle |date=12 August 2016 |website=[[Los Angeles Times  |accessdate=13 August 2016 </ref> Vince Gonzales, professor of professional practice at [[USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism  wrote ""I think this borders on journalistic malpractice"".<ref name=""LATimes1"" /> The president of [[GLAAD , [[Sarah Kate Ellis , wrote ""How this reporter thought it was OK—or that somehow it was in the public's interest—to write about his deceitful encounters with these men reflects a complete lack of judgment and disregard for basic decency, not to mention the ethics of journalism"".<ref name=""LATimes1"" />  ==References==   ==External links== *  * [http://www.psfk.com/2009/05/video-psfk-conference-nyc-new-york-new-media.html/ Video: PSFK Conference NYC: New York New Media] PSFK, 7 May 2009 – Edward Felsenthal at the PSFK Conference NYC: New York New Media *       [[Category:American news websites  [[Category:IAC  company   [[Category:Internet properties established in 2008 ","The Daily Beast is an American news and opinion website focused on politics and pop culture.

575,Y,advocate.com,"   '''''The Advocate''''' is an American [[LGBT -interest magazine, printed bi-monthly and available by subscription. ''The Advocate'' brand also includes a website. Both magazine and website have an editorial focus on news, politics, opinion, and arts and entertainment of interest to lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender  LGBT  people. The magazine, established in 1967, is the oldest and largest LGBT publication in the United States and the only surviving one of its kind that was founded before the 1969 [[Stonewall riots  in New York City, an incident that is generally credited as the beginning of the LGBT rights movement.  ==History== [[File:Advocate1.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Masthead from ''The Advocate'', volume 1, issue 1  ''The Advocate'' was first published as a local newsletter by the activist group [[Personal Rights in Defense and Education   PRIDE  in Los Angeles. The newsletter was inspired by a police raid on a Los Angeles gay bar, the [[Black Cat Tavern , on January 1, 1967, and the demonstrations against [[police brutality  in the months following that raid. Richard Mitch  using the pseudonym ""Dick Michaels""  and Bill Rau  under the name ""Bill Rand""  joined PRIDE and, along with [[Aristide Laurent  and artist Sam Winston, transformed the newsletter into a newspaper titled ''The Los Angeles Advocate''. The first issue bore a cover date of September 1967, and was sold for 25 cents in gay bars in Los Angeles. By early 1968, PRIDE was struggling to stay viable and Mitch and Rau paid the group one dollar for ownership of the paper in February of that year. In 1969 the newspaper was renamed ''The Advocate'' and distributed nationally. By 1974, Mitch and Rau were printing 40,000 copies for each issue.  The newspaper attracted the attention of [[David B. Goodstein , an investment banker from San Francisco who bought the publication in 1974. Under Goodstein's direction, ''The Advocate'' transformed into a bi-weekly national news magazine covering events important to the GLBT community, including the [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement , along with arts and culture. Goodstein also worked toward reducing sex-oriented advertisements in favor of more mainstream sponsors.  Goodstein and Dr. Rob Eichberg created ''The Advocate Experience''. Loosely based on the then-popular [[Erhard Seminars Training|EST   Erhardt Seminars Training , it was a two-weekend, all-day series of extensive self-realization workshops to bring self-acceptance, awareness and tolerance within the [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|LGBT community . Goodstein and Eichberg facilitated the workshops for much of their duration. Goodstein's later editorials remained strongly opposed state intervention during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. He argued even though ""our lifestyle can become an elaborate suicidal ritual...our safety and survival depends on each of us and our individual behaviour,"" as opposed to government [[public health  regulations.  Soon after Goodstein's death in 1985, the magazine was transformed from a [[Tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid -size newspaper format in two sections  with the second section carrying sexually explicit advertisements  to a standard magazine format, beginning with the October 1, 1985 issue.  Breakthroughs in straight celebrity covers came under the flamboyant command of editor in chief, Richard Rouilard in the 1980s and early 1990s. After his death from AIDS, this editorial trend continued successfully with editor in chief Jeff Yarbrough. It was during this time that the magazine stopped carrying sexually explicit advertisements, and in 1992 it launched a sister publication, ''Advocate Classifieds''. Under the leadership of its first female editor in chief, Judy Wieder,  1996—2002; editorial director, 2002-2006 , ''The Advocate'' brought in a variety of voices, won numerous mainstream publishing awards, and set records for newsstand sales, circulation, and advertising. Wieder and her staff's coming-out interviews with such diverse gay luminaries as [[Ellen DeGeneres , [[George Michael , [[Liz Smith  journalist |Liz Smith , [[Gore Vidal , [[Chaz Bono , [[Jim McGreevey , [[Melissa Etheridge  and [[Rob Halford  garnered the magazine much television exposure and helped to lift the status of ""''The Advocate'' Interview"" as well as the visibility of the publication.  ''The Advocate '' changed hands through a series of mergers and acquisitions, first unsuccessfully with PlanetOut in 2006, and later with [[Here Media . In a cost-cutting move in 2008, Here Media, conceding that ''The Advocate'' print edition could no longer compete with local weekly LGBT newspapers and the Internet for hard news, switched the magazine from a bi-weekly to a monthly publication cycle. Starting in 2010, Here Media consolidated the distribution for ''The Advocate'' and ''[[Out  magazine |Out '' magazines. ''The Advocate'' print version continues to be published and is available enclosed with ''Out'' as a combination package via subscription. In 2010 there were press reports of freelance writers not being paid for their work. As of May 2013, ''The Advocate'' is no longer produced in-house at Here Media but by Grand Editorial for Here Media. Grand Editorial is a contractor based in Brooklyn, New York, that also produces ''Out''.<ref name=""Fishbowl 2013""> Matthew Breen Headed to Brooklyn |publisher=FishbowlNY |website=MediaBistro.org |date=May 6, 2013 |accessdate=June 16, 2014 </ref> ''The Advocate'' is now published bi-monthly with 6 issues per year.<ref name=""Fishbowl 2013""/>  ==Comics== ''The Advocate'' provided a venue for several noteworthy LGBT cartoonists in the 1970s and 1980s. Early in its history the publication ran single-panel gag cartoons by [[Joe Johnson  cartoonist |Joe Johnson  featuring effeminate Miss Thing and beefy Big Dick,<ref name=""GLBTQ""></ref> and ""Gayer Than Strange"" by [[Sean  cartoonist |Sean .

It was to serve as a platform for conservative speakers and debates between conservative and liberal speakers.  In 2003 Horowitz expanded the scope of the CSPC to include monitoring what CSPC views as an ingrained hostility towards conservative scholarship and ideas within academia. He established Students for Academic Freedom  SAF  to further that goal.  DHFC is a [[501 c   3  charity. In 2005 it had revenues of $4.9 million, expenses of $4.0 million, 8.4% of which was $336,000 compensation for David Horowitz.<ref name=""char""/> For 2008 the DHFC reported on IRS Form 990 revenues of $5,466,103 and expenses of $5,994,547 with total compensation to David Horowitz of $480,162 and to vice-president Peter Collier of $228,744.  == Programs == The Center has the following ongoing programs. * [[FrontPage Magazine|''FrontPage'' Magazine &nbsp;– a political website edited by Horowitz with a focus is on issues pertaining to [[foreign relations of the United States|foreign policy , war, and terrorism. * ''TruthRevolt'' – a news website edited by Mark Tapson whose mission is ""to expose the leftist news media and to hold them accountable for their hypocrisy and bias."" * [[Discover the Networks  – a database of alleged left-wing agendas, activists and groups.

Its focus was said to be on exposing the excesses of ""[[political correctness "" on college and university campuses across the United States.  == Funding activities ==  Between July 2000 and February 2006, the center  under its old name  was the sponsor of 25 trips by [[United States Senate|United States senators  and [[United States House of Representatives|representatives , all [[Republican Party  United States |Republicans , to six different events. Total expenditures were about $43,000.  In 2014–2015, Horowitz provided $250,000 in funding to the Dutch [[Far-right politics|right -wing nationalist [[Geert Wilders 's [[Party for Freedom , possibly violating U.S. tax law.  == Criticism ==  The [[Southern Poverty Law Center   SPLC  has described the Center as a [[far-right  organization<ref name=""SPLC""></ref> and anti-Muslim hate group. According to Horowitz, the SPLC's designation of his conservative think tank as a hate group resulted in his Freedom Center's donation processing system being blocked by Visa and Mastercard, in which he plans to ""fight back"" and ""push for an investigation"" against the SPLC and Visa and Mastercard.  [[Chip Berlet , writing for the SPLC, accused Horowitz of blaming slavery on ""black Africans ... abetted by dark-skinned Arabs"" and of ""attack[ing] minority 'demands for special treatment' as 'only necessary because some blacks can't seem to locate the ladder of opportunity within reach of others,' rejecting the idea that they could be the victims of lingering racism."" Responding with an open letter to [[Morris Dees , president of the SPLC, Horowitz stated that his reminder that the slaves transported to America were bought from African and Arab slavers was a response to demands that only whites pay blacks reparations, not to hold Africans and Arabs solely responsible for slavery, and that the statement that he had denied lingering racism was ""a calculated and carefully constructed lie."" The letter said that Berlet's work was ""so tendentious, so filled with transparent misrepresentations and smears that if you continue to post the report you will create for your Southern Poverty Law Center a well-earned reputation as a hate group itself."" The SPLC replied that they stood by the accuracy of the report, and subsequent critical pieces on Berlet and the SPLC have been featured on Horowitz's website and personal blog.  In a 2011 report, the [[Center for American Progress  cited Horowitz as a prominent figure instrumental in [[Islamophobia|demonizing Islam  and spreading fear about an Islamic takeover of [[Western society . Horowitz responded, saying that the Center had ""joined the Muslim Brotherhood"".  The [[Anti-Defamation League  wrote that Horowitz sponsors a college campus project that promotes anti-Muslim views and arranges events with anti-Muslim activists. The DHFC was also a sponsor of the May 3, 2015 [[Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest  in [[Garland, Texas|Garland , [[Texas , where two [[Muslim terrorist  attackers were shot and killed by a school security guard.  == References ==   == External links == * [http://www.horowitzfreedomcenter.org/ David Horowitz Freedom Center website] Official Website. * [http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/ Discover the Networks] ""Guide to the Political Left"". * [http://www.newsrealblog.com/ NewsReal Blog] Focused to ""analyze and critique cable shows, newspapers, magazines, and the blogosphere to reveal the political Left's methods and agendas"". * [http://www.jihadwatch.org/ Jihad Watch]  [[Category:Criticism of political correctness  [[Category:David Horowitz  [[Category:Political organizations in the United States  [[Category:Organizations established in 1988  [[Category:Charities based in California  [[Category:1988 establishments in California  [[Category:Opposition to Islam in the United States  [[Category:Conservative organizations in the United States ","The David Horowitz Freedom Center, formerly the Center for the Study of Popular Culture  CSPC , is a conservative foundation founded in 1988 by political activist David Horowitz and his long-time collaborator Peter Collier.

Keith Moyer  | editor = Glenn Cook | ISSN = 1097-1645 | website = [http://www.reviewjournal.com/ reviewjournal.com]   The '''''Las Vegas Review-Journal''''' is a major daily newspaper published in [[Las Vegas , [[Nevada , since 1909. It is the largest circulating daily newspaper in Nevada and one of two daily newspapers in the Las Vegas area. It is ranked as one of the top 25 newspapers in the United States by circulation.  The ''Review-Journal'' has a [[joint operating agreement  with [[The Greenspun Corporation -owned ''[[Las Vegas Sun '', which runs through 2040. In 2005, the ''Sun'' ceased afternoon publication and began distribution as a section of the ''Review-Journal''. On March 18, 2015, the sale of the newspaper's parent company, [[Stephens Media  newspapers |Stephens Media LLC , to [[New Media Investment Group  was completed.<ref name=""lvrj150318""></ref> In December 2015, casino magnate [[Sheldon Adelson  purchased the newspaper for $140 million via News + Media Capital Group LLC, although a subsidiary of New Media Investment Group, GateHouse Media, was retained to manage the newspaper. $140 million was considered a steep price amounting to a 69% gain for New Media Investment Group after owning the newspaper for nine months.  In 2018, ''Editor and Publisher'' magazine named the ''Review-Journal'' as one of 10 newspapers in the United States ""doing it right"".  ==History== The ''Clark County Review'' was first printed in 1909 and became the ''Las Vegas Review'' in 1926 when owner Frank Garside, who owned several other Nevada papers, brought in [[Albert Edmunds Cahlan|Al Cahlan  as a partner. In March 1929, the ''Clark County Journal'' began publication, and in July of that year, the ''Review'' bought the ''Journal'' and shortly thereafter began co-publication as the ''Las Vegas Evening Review-Journal''. In the early 1940s, Cahlan and Garside's company, Southwestern Publishing, bought the ''Las Vegas Age'', from Charles P. ""Pop"" Squires, which began publication in 1905 and was the oldest surviving paper in Las Vegas. The word ""evening"" was dropped from the name in 1949 when Garside left the company and Cahlan struck an agreement with [[Donald W. Reynolds  and his [[Donrey Media Group .<ref name=""The Las Vegas Newspaper War of the 1950's""></ref>  In 1953, the ''RJ'' signed on [[KBAD  AM |KORK , one of Las Vegas' earliest radio stations.  Two years later, it signed on Las Vegas' third television station, KLRJ-TV, in 1955, later changing the calls to KORK-TV.  The station was sold in 1979, changing its call letters again first to KVBC, and then, in 2010, to the current [[KSNV-DT .  In December 1960, Reynolds exercised a buyout option with Cahlan, and bought the paper.  Reynolds died in 1993, and longtime friend Jack Stephens bought his company, renamed it [[Stephens Media  newspapers |Stephens Media  and moved the company's headquarters to Las Vegas. The ''Review-Journal'' entered into its first Joint Operating Agreement, or JOA, with the ''Sun'' in 1990, which was amended in 2005. In early 2015, the Stephens Media newspapers were sold to [[New Media Investment Group .<ref name=""lvrj150318""/><ref name=""lvrj150219""></ref>  The current ''Review-Journal'' headquarters was built in 1971. A new $40 million printing press was installed in 2000 as part of a four-year, 152,000-square-foot expansion project. The two printing presses weigh 910 tons and consist of 16 towers. They were the largest presses in the world when they were installed.  The newspaper has won the ""General Excellence"" award from the Nevada Press Association several times and has also won the ""Freedom of the Press"" award for its [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment  battles from the statewide organization.  ===Sheldon Adelson ownership=== When the paper was sold in 2015, it was initially unclear who the buyer was. The purchaser was a limited liability company, News + Media Capital Group LLC, and the only name listed on the documents was Michael Schroeder, a publisher of four small regional newspapers in Connecticut.<ref name = ""Primack1""/> At a December 10 staff meeting informing the ''Review-Journal'' staff that the paper had been sold, Schroeder was introduced as the manager. He refused to say who the owners of News + Media were, saying that employees should ""focus on [their] jobs...and don't worry about who [the owners] are."" Jason Taylor, the ''Review-Journal's'' publisher, said only that the ownership included ""multiple owner/investors, that some are from Las Vegas, and that in face-to-face meetings he has been assured that the group will not meddle in the newspaper’s editorial content.”<ref name=""Primack1""></ref> There were widespread rumors that the primary buyer was [[Sheldon Adelson , and a week later three ''Review-Journal'' reporters confirmed that the purchase had been orchestrated by Adelson's son-in-law Patrick Dumont on Adelson's behalf. A month before the new owner was revealed, three reporters at the newspaper received an assignment from corporate management: Spend two weeks monitoring the activity of three Clark County judges. One of the judges was District Judge Elizabeth Gonzalez, who was hearing a long-running wrongful termination lawsuit filed against Adelson and his company.  In January a set of editorial principles were drawn up and publicized to ensure the newspaper's independence and to deal with possible conflicts of interest involving Adelson's ownership. In February Craig Moon, a veteran of the Gannett organization, was announced as the new publisher and promptly withdrew those principles from publication. He also began to personally review, edit, and sometimes kill stories about an Adelson-promoted proposal for [[Las Vegas Stadium|a new football stadium . In the months since, reporters say that stories about Adelson, and particularly about an ongoing lawsuit involving his business dealings in Macau, have been heavily edited by top management.  The new ownership triggered numerous departures. On December 23 the paper's editor Mike Hengel stepped down in a ""voluntary buyout"". Many reporters and editors left the newspaper citing ""curtailed editorial freedom, murky business dealings and unethical managers.""<ref name = ""leaving""/> Longtime columnist John L. Smith resigned after he was told he could no longer write anything about Adelson, a frequent focus of his reporting up till then.<ref name = ""leaving"" /> Within six months, all three of the reporters who broke the story of Adelson's ownership had left the paper.<ref name = ""leaving""></ref>  ==Other publications== The ''Review-Journal'' is responsible for several other niche publications: * ''El Tiempo'' – a free weekly Spanish language paper distributed around the Las Vegas area * ''Neon'' – a weekend publication distributed through the ''Review-Journal'' that covers music, movies, arts and dining * ''Luxury Las Vegas'' – a monthly high-end lifestyle magazine established in 2003 focusing on fashion, food, and home trends  The ''Review-Journal'' also operates several Nevada newspapers: * ''Boulder City Review'' – A weekly paper that debuted Oct. 29, 2009. The print edition is distributed on Thursday mornings. * ''Pahrump Valley Times'' – A bi-weekly newspaper. The print edition is distributed on Wednesday and Friday mornings. * ''Tonopah Times-Bonanza & Goldfield News'' – Serving communities in Nye and Esmeralda counties since 1901.  ==Website and video==  The ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'' launched its website as LVRJ.com on Jan. 15, 1997. By the end of the year, it was recognized as one of the top online papers in the U.S. by the Internet Job Source. The Review-Journal also operated LasVegas.com as a general information site. LVRJ.com was redesigned in 2000 and the site was rebranded as Reviewjournal.com two years later. In 2012, the RJ launched its first apps for iPhone, Android, and iPad. A major online redesign launched in April 2017 with an emphasis on video. The RJ built a studio on its downtown campus to produce high-end live and on-demand videos for news, politics and sports.  Programs include: * ''Reporter Roundtable'' – Interviews and panel discussions with reporters covering major stories * ''Vegas Nation'' – Coverage of Raiders football * ''Golden Edge'' – Coverage of the Las Vegas Golden Knights hockey team * ''Covering the Cage'' – UFC and MMA coverage * ''Nevada Politics Today'' * ''Sports Betting Spotlight''  In addition to delivering its shows on the ''Review-Journal'' website, the ''Review-Journal'' launched a Roku app in early 2018.  ==Controversy== In 1998, the newspaper killed a story about casino mogul [[Steve Wynn 's sexual harassment of employees. The newspaper reported about the axed story in 2018, after the ''Wall Street Journal'' published a story in which dozens of people alleged that they had been victims of sexual misconduct by Wynn.<ref name="":0""></ref>  ===Copyright infringement litigation=== [[File:Las Vegas Review-Journal sign.jpg|thumb|Las Vegas Review-Journal sign  In 2010, the ''Review-Journal's'' then-owner Stephens Media launched a copyright enforcement company called [[Righthaven  LLC, which began a series of legal suits claiming copyright infringements. The company's practice was to search the internet for uses of ''Review-Journal'' material, purchase the copyright for that material from the newspaper, and then file suit for copyright infringement. According to the ''[[Wall Street Journal '', ""Defendants typically get no warning, no take-down request, just a suit."" Between March and August 2010, Righthaven LLC filed copyright infringement suits against 107 blogs,  political forums, major political parties, and several of the newspaper's own sources including NORML, DailyPaul.com, Infowars, Free Republic and others.  In September 2010, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation , together with other ''[[pro bono '' attorneys, filed an Answer and Counterclaim on behalf of [[Democratic Underground , a political website that Righthaven sued after a Democratic Underground member posted a five-sentence excerpt from a ''Review-Journal'' article.<ref name=""counterclaim""></ref> Counterclaims were asserted against Stephens Media as well as Righthaven. The pleading alleged a ""sham relationship"" between the newspaper and Righthaven, and accused Righthaven of copyright fraud.<ref name=""counterclaim""/>  In March 2011, a federal judge dismissed a suit brought by Righthaven, stating that no evidence had been presented that the forum posting of a ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'' editorial for 40 days for noncommercial use harmed the market value of the work. In June 2011, another federal judge ruled that Righthaven had no standing to sue for copyright infringement, on the grounds that the original parties retain the actual copyrights.<ref name=""Vegasinc ruling""></ref> In August 2011 another case was dismissed by Federal judge [[Philip Pro , who found that Righthaven had no standing to sue, and in any case the defendant's posting of a ''Review-Journal'' editorial to a blog was protected by fair use. The next month the ''Review-Journal'' terminated its arrangement with Righthaven,<ref name=Wired></ref> which was forced into receivership in November 2011 because of unpaid legal settlements.<ref name=insolvency></ref>  ==Owners and publishers  past and present == '''Owners'''  # Frank Garside  1909-1949  # [[Albert Edmunds Cahlan|A.

Prominent U.S. political bloggers including Juli Weiner, Jim Newell and [[Alex Pareene  established their careers at ''Wonkette''. The current editor is Rebecca Schoenkopf, formerly of ''[[OC Weekly ''. ''Wonkette'' covers US politics from Washington DC to local schoolboards. Taking a sarcastic tone, the site focuses heavily on humorous breaking news, rumors, and the downfall of the powerful. It also deals with serious matters of politics and policy, producing in-depth analysis.  ==Launch and history== ''Wonkette'' was established in January 2004 as part of the [[Gawker Media  network. Its founding [[Editing|editor  was [[Ana Marie Cox , a former editor at [[suck.com .  Cox rapidly established a large reading audience and media notice for the site. The blog gained further national media attention after Cox publicized the story of [[Jessica Cutler  aka ""Washingtonienne"", a former [[United States Congress|Hill  staffer who blogged about her [[affair  with a member of former Senator [[Mike DeWine 's staff.  Cox announced her resignation as ''Wonkette'''s editor on January 5, 2006, in order to promote her book, ''Dog Days'', and was succeeded by [[David Lat , the author of [[Underneath Their Robes , a blog about the federal judiciary, and [[Alex Pareene , a young [[New York University  student and Gawker intern/guest editor in New York who moved to D.C. for the ''Wonkette'' position.  In late 2007, Pareene moved to the flagship [[Gawker  site and, in April 2010, to [[Salon.com|Salon .   In June 2006, Lat announced his decision to leave ''Wonkette''. His slot was to be filled by guest editors until August 2006, when longtime political blogger [[Ken Layne  joined as editor. ''Wonkette'' reached its largest pre-2008 audience during the 2006 midterm elections due to scandal coverage of [[Mark Foley  and other incumbents involved in corruption, sex-abuse and bribery scandals.  After Pareene and Layne's departure in October 2007, a team of new editors including [[John Clarke,&nbsp;Jr. , and [[Megan Carpentier  was installed by Gawker management. Gawker publisher [[Nick Denton  brought Layne back as sole editor two months later, who put in place the team of [[Jim Newell  of [[IvyGate , videographer [[Liz Glover , former Gawker blogger [[Sara K. Smith , Columbia literary magazine ''[[The Blue and White '' editor [[Juli Weiner , and longtime contributors [[Princess Sparkle Pony   [[Peter Huestis   and [[Josh Fruhlinger , the [[Comics Curmudgeon .  ''Wonkette'' teams covered both the Denver DNC and St.&nbsp;Paul RNC conventions. Newell and columnist Josh Fruhlinger covered [[Barack Obama 's inauguration in Washington. As with many political websites, readership hit new records between the November 2008 election and January 2009 inauguration.  Past and current guest editors and contributors include ''[[Reason Magazine '' editor [[Nick Gillespie , ''[[Washington Post '' reporter [[David Weigel , [[DCeiver  editor and ''[[Huffington Post '' writer [[Jason Linkins , Gawker editor and [[The Awl  founder [[Choire Sicha , New York comedian and author [[Sara Benincasa , Chicago artist and journalist [[Lauri Apple , ''[[Boston Globe '' political blogger [[Garrett Quinn , cartoonist [[Benjamin Frisch , and ''[[Vanity Fair  magazine |Vanity Fair '' online writer [[Juli Weiner .  In April 2011, ''Wonkette'' came under criticism after blogger Jack Stuef wrote a post that was interpreted as mocking [[Trig Palin  for his having [[Down syndrome .  The post suggested that Trig was possibly the result of incest between [[Todd Palin  and [[Bristol Palin .  In response, at least 14 advertisers, including major companies such as Ford, [[Toyota , [[Verizon , [[Nordstrom , and [[Papa John's , announced that they would exclude their network remnant advertising from Wonkette. Editor Ken Layne announced that Stuef was placed on probation and Stuef apologized for the post.  The name of the site is a play on the slang word ''wonk'', meaning a ""zealous student of political policy"", adding the feminine ending to best describe founding editor Cox and as a play on the word ""gazette.""  ===Separation from Gawker Media=== On April 14, 2008, [[Gawker Media  announced that it was selling ''Wonkette'' and that Layne would remain managing editor and part owner. Gawker Media head Nick Denton attributed the sale to ""hunkering down"" before another dot com downturn and the Internet bubble bursts: ""And, even if not, better safe than sorry; and better too early than too late..."" Gawker's Silicon Valley gossip site, [[Valleywag , was merged with the flagship [[Gawker.com  site, its popular music site, [[Idolator  website |Idolator , was sold to [[Buzznet , and [[The Consumerist  was sold to [[Consumers Union  as part of the same divestiture effort.  Wonkette Media also launched [[Wonkabout , a D.C. culture guide, which ran from February 12, 2009 until April 28, 2011, and was edited by Arielle Fleisher.  In February, 2017, ''Wonkette'' went ad-free , and it is now supported by reader donations.   ==Style and frequent targets== ''Wonkette'' makes frequent targets of mainstream media outlets like [[CNN , ''[[The Washington Post '' and ''[[Politico  newspaper |Politico '', when they are perceived as missing opportunities for substantive political analysis by attempting to get ""scoops"" or simply covering the actions of others in the [[mainstream media . [[Truck Nutz  references became very popular during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential Election , while following the election of Barack Obama, the site also published humorous pieces about [[Tea Party protests|Tea Party Protesters , [[Birthers , [[Peggy Noonan 's weekly column and [[Sarah Palin . Right-wing blogs such as Andrew Breitbart's ''Big Government'' and National Review Online's ''The Corner'' are constant targets.  ==Regular features== * [http://wonkette.com/tag/pt-gifzette-daily-briefing/ Gifzette Daily Briefing]: Morning humor and commentary by [[Matt Langer , editor of [[Gifzette  and writer for [[The Awl . * [http://wonkette.com/tag/pt-ayn-rands-adventures-in-wonderland/ Ayn Rand's Adventures In Wonderland: America 2010]: Serial graphic novel by cartoonist Benjamin Frisch.

Items are frequently picked up by national broadcasts including ''[[Colbert Report '', ''[[Wait, Wait Don't Tell Me '' and [[CNN .  Alex Nichols, writing in ''[[The Outline  website |The Outline '' in 2017, described ''Wonkette'', saying, ""This is why I love Wonkette, the gossip blog that refuses to die. Wonkette is Bush-era liberalism frozen in amber, motionless and immortal, forced to passively observe a changing world until the end of time. Why does it still exist? Hard to say. But as long as it is here, we must celebrate its inanity."" He wrote, ""The site isn't an indictment of centrists, the Democratic Party, or neoliberalism. It doesn't prove a point about anything, and it isn't an example of any trend or political tendency, which makes it all the more baffling ... Wonkette simply exists, and it might outlast us all.""  ==References==   == External links == * [http://www.wonkette.com ''Wonkette'']    [[Category:American political websites  [[Category:American satirical magazines  [[Category:Gawker Media  [[Category:Magazines established in 2004  [[Category:American online magazines  [[Category:American political blogs ","Wonkette is an American online magazine of topical satire and political gossip, established in 2004 by Gawker Media and founding editor Ana Marie Cox, edited by Ken Layne from 2006 to 2012,  and owned and edited by Rebecca Schoenkopf since 2012.

At its peak, it had more  than 6,000 media subscribers. Since the first of several sales and staff cutbacks in 1982, and the 1999 sale of its broadcast client list to its rival, the [[Associated Press , UPI has concentrated on smaller information-market niches.  ==History== [[File:Bell telephone magazine  1922   14755909362 .jpg|thumb|News room of United Press in New York, 1933  Formally named '''""United Press Associations""''' for incorporation and legal purposes, but publicly known and identified as '''United Press''' or '''UP''', the news agency was created by the 1907 uniting of three smaller news syndicates by the Midwest newspaper publisher [[E. W. Scripps .<ref name=""deadline""/><ref name=""scrippshoward""/><ref name=""100years""/> It was headed by [[Hugh Baillie   1890–1966  from 1935 to 1955. At the time of his retirement, UP had 2,900 clients in the United States, and 1,500 abroad.  In 1958, it became '''United Press International''' after absorbing the [[International News Service   INS  </ref><ref name=bbupinw></ref>  As either UP or UPI, the agency was among the largest newswire services in the world, competing domestically for about 90 years with the [[Associated Press  and internationally with AP, [[Reuters  and ''[[Agence France-Presse .''  At its peak, UPI had more than 2,000 full-time employees; and 200 news bureaus in 92 countries; it had more than 6,000 media subscribers. With the rising popularity of television news, the business of UPI began to decline as the circulation of afternoon newspapers, its chief client category, began to fall. Its decline accelerated after the 1982 sale of UPI by the Scripps company.<ref name=""in sorrow""/>  The [[E.W.

Since the 1999 sale of its broadcast client list to its one-time major rival, the AP, UPI has concentrated on smaller information market niches. It no longer services media organizations in a major way.<ref name=""cuts employees""/>  In 2000, UPI was purchased by [[News World Communications , an international news media company founded in 1976 by [[Unification Church  leader [[Sun Myung Moon .<ref name=""staff cuts""/><ref name=""cjr""/>  It now maintains a news website and photo service and electronically publishes several information product packages.  Based mostly on aggregation from other sources on the Web and gathered by a small editorial staff and [[Stringer  journalism |stringers , UPI's daily content consists of a newsbrief summary service called ""NewsTrack,"" which includes general, business, sports, science, health and entertainment reports, and ""Quirks in the News."" It also sells a premium service, which has deeper coverage and analysis of emerging threats, the security industry, and energy resources. UPI's content is presented in text, video and photo formats, in  English, Spanish, and Arabic.<ref name=""products""/>  UPI's main office is in the Miami metropolitan area and it maintains office locations in five other countries and uses freelance journalists in other major cities.  ===United Press Associations=== [[File:E W Scripps.jpg|thumbnail|Portrait photograph of [[E. W. Scripps , c. 1912  Beginning with the ''[[Cleveland Press '', publisher [[E. W. Scripps   1854–1926  created the first chain of newspapers in the United States. Because the then recently reorganized [[Associated Press  refused to sell its services to several of his papers, most of them evening dailies in competition with existing AP franchise holders, in 1907 Scripps merged three smaller syndicates under his ownership or control, the Publishers Press Association, the Scripps-McRae Press Association, and the Scripps News Association, to form United Press Associations, with headquarters in New York City.<ref name=""deadline""/><ref name=""scrippshoward""/><ref name=""100years""/>  Scripps had been a subscriber to an earlier news agency, also named '''United Press,''' that existed in the late 1800s, partly in cooperation with management of the original New York-based AP and partly in existential competition with two Chicago-based organizations also using the AP name  as detailed at [[Associated Press  and in AP's 2007 history, ''Breaking News: How the Associated Press Has Covered War, Peace, and Everything Else'', cited below .<ref name=""deadline""/><ref name=""scrippshoward""/>  Drawing lessons from the battles between the earlier United Press and the various AP's, Scripps required that there be no restrictions on who could buy news from his news service, and he made the new UP service available to anyone, including his competitors. Scripps also hoped to make a profit from selling that news to papers owned by others. At that time and until [[World War II , most newspapers relied on news agencies for stories outside their immediate geographic areas.<ref name=""deadline""/><ref name=""rip""/>  Despite strong newspaper industry opposition, UP started to sell news to the new and competitive radio medium in 1935, years before competitor AP, controlled by the newspaper industry, did likewise.  Scripps' United Press was considered ""a scrappy alternative"" news source to the AP. UP reporters were called ""Unipressers"" and were noted for their fiercely aggressive and competitive streak.<ref name=""rip""/> Another hallmark of the company's culture was little formal training of reporters; new hires were often thrust into a ""sink-or-swim"" situation of reporting on an unfamiliar subject. They were weaned on UP's famous and well-documented  though frequently misappropriated and misquoted  slogan of ""Get it first, but FIRST, get it RIGHT.""<ref name=""deadline""/> Despite controversy, UP  and later UPI  became a common training ground for generations of journalists.<ref name=""rip""/>  [[Walter Cronkite , who started with United Press in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City , gained fame for his coverage of [[World War II  in Europe and turned down [[Edward R. Murrow 's first offer of a [[CBS  job to stay with UP, but who later went on to anchor the ''[[CBS Evening News '', once said, ""I felt every Unipresser got up in the morning saying, 'This is the day I'm going to beat the hell out of AP.' That was part of the spirit. We knew we were undermanned. But we knew we could do a darn good job despite that, and so many times, we did.""<ref name=""rip""/> 	 Despite that, like all agencies that deal with huge volumes of timely information, UP and later UPI had its share of remembered mistakes. As recounted in the various printed histories of UPI cited below, the most famous one came early in its history. UP's president, [[Roy W. Howard , then traveling in France, telegraphed that the 1918 armistice ending World War I had been declared four days before it happened. Howard's reputation survived and he later became a Scripps partner, whose name appeared in one of the Scripps subsidiary companies, Scripps-Howard. But the mistake dogged UP/UPI for generations. Still, the agency's reporters were often able to tell stories more quickly and accurately although they were usually outnumbered by the competition. In 1950, for example, UP reported the invasion of South Korea by North Korea two hours and forty minutes before its archrival, the AP. ''The New York Times'' later apologized to UP for refusing to print information on the invasion until the AP had confirmed it.<ref name=""deadline""/>  ===United Press International=== Frank Bartholomew, the last UP president to ascend to the agency's top job directly from its news, rather than sales, ranks, took over in 1955, and according to his cited autobiography, was obsessed with merging UP with the [[International News Service , a news agency that had been founded by [[William Randolph Hearst  in 1909 following Scripps' lead.  Bartholomew succeeded in putting the ""I"" in UPI in 1958 when UP and INS merged to become United Press International  The new UPI now had 6,000 employees and 5,000 subscribers, about a thousand of them newspapers.<ref name=""rip""/><ref name=""time magazine""/>  The merger was aimed at creating a stronger competitor for the [[Associated Press  and a stronger economic entity than either UP or INS. The newly formed United Press International  UPI  had 950 client newspapers.<ref name=""time magazine""/> Fearing possible anti-trust issues with the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower  Administration [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department , Scripps and Hearst rushed the merger through with unusual speed and secrecy.  Although all UP employees were retained, most INS employees lost their jobs with practically no warning. A relative few did join the new UPI and the columns of popular INS writers, such as [[Bob Considine , [[Louella Parsons  and [[Ruth Montgomery , were carried by UPI.<ref name=""time magazine""/>  Rival AP was a publishers' cooperative and could assess its members to help pay the extraordinary costs of covering major news—wars, the Olympic Games, national political conventions. UPI clients, in contrast, paid a fixed annual rate; depending on individual contracts, UPI could not always ask them to help shoulder the extraordinary coverage costs. In its heyday, newspapers typically paid UPI about half what they paid AP in the same cities for the same services: At one point, for example, the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' paid AP $12,500 a week, but UPI only $5,000; the Wall Street Journal paid AP $36,000 a week, but UPI only $19,300. The AP, which serviced 1,243 newspapers at the time, remained UPI's main competitor.<ref name=""rip""/><ref name=""time magazine""/> In 1959, UPI had 6,208 clients in 92 countries and territories, 234 news and picture bureaus, and an annual payroll of $34,000,000,  $   in today's dollars.<ref name=""rip""/><ref name=""reports a record""/>  But the UP-INS merger involved another business component that was to hurt the new UPI company badly in later years. Because INS had been a subsidiary of Hearst's [[King Features Syndicate  and Scripps controlled several other newspaper syndicates, both companies feared possible anti-trust issues. So they deliberately kept their respective syndicates out of the combined UPI company. That move cost UPI the revenues of its previous [[United Feature Syndicate  subsidiary, which in later years made large profits on the syndication of ''[[Peanuts '' and other popular [[comic strips  and columns.  UPI had an advantage of independence over the AP in reporting on the [[Civil Rights Movement  of the 1950s and 1960s. Because the AP was a cooperative essentially owned by the newspapers, those in the [[Southern United States|South  influenced its coverage of the racial unrest and protests, often ignoring, minimizing, or slanting the reporting.<ref name=""rip""/> UPI did not have that sort of pressure, and management, according to UPI reporters and photographers of the day, allowed them much freedom in chronicling the events of the civil rights struggle.<ref name=""rip""/>  White House reporter [[Helen Thomas  became the public face of UPI, as she was seen at televised press conferences beginning in the early 1960s.<ref name=""rip""/> UPI famously scooped the AP in reporting the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of US President John Kennedy  on Friday, November 22, 1963.<ref name=""rip""/> UPI White House reporter [[Merriman Smith  was an eyewitness, and he commandeered the press car's only phone to dictate the story to UPI as AP reporter Jack Bell tried—without success—to wrest the phone away so he could call his office.<ref name=""in sorrow""/> Smith and UPI won a [[Pulitzer Prize  for this reporting.<ref name=""rip""/>  ===UP/UPI Newspictures, Newsfilm and Audio/Radio Network===  United Press had no direct [[wirephoto  service until 1952, when it absorbed co-owned [[ACME Newspictures , under pressure from parent company Scripps to better compete with AP's news and photo services.<ref name=""newspictures""/>  By that time, UP was also deeply involved with the newer visual medium of [[television . In 1948, it entered into a partnership with [[20th Century Fox  subsidiary Fox [[Movietone News  to shoot newsfilm for television stations. That service, United Press Movietone, or UPMT, was a pioneer in newsfilm syndication and numbered among its clients major US and foreign networks and local stations, including for many years the early TV operation of [[ABC News . In subsequent decades, it underwent several changes in partnerships and names, becoming best known as [[United Press International Television News   UPITN . Senior UPITN executives later helped [[Ted Turner  create [[CNN , with its first two presidents, [[Reese Schonfeld  and [[Burt Reinhardt , coming from UPITN ranks.  The UPI Audio actuality service for radio stations, created in 1958 and later renamed the [[United Press International Radio Network , was a spinoff from the newsfilm service and eventually provided news material to more than a thousand radio stations and US and foreign networks, including [[NPR .<ref name=""audio""/>  ===Decline=== UPI came close to equaling the size of the AP in the early 1960s, but as publishing companies began to pare their evening newspapers, it was dropped by papers that could no longer afford to subscribe to both UPI and the AP.<ref name=""rip""/> UPI's failure to develop a television presence or subsidiary television news service has also been cited as one of the causes of its decline.<ref name=""rip""/> By the early 1980s, the number of staffers was down to 1,800 and there were just 100 news bureaus.<ref name=""old dog""/>  Under pressure from some of [[E. W. Scripps ' heirs, [[E. W. Scripps Company|the Scripps company , which had been underwriting UPI's expenses at a loss for at least two decades, began trying to transfer control of UPI in the early 1980s. It tried to bring in additional newspaper industry partners and when that failed, engaged in serious negotiations with British competitor [[Reuters , which wanted to increase its US presence. As detailed in ""Down to the Wire"", by Gordon and Cohen, cited below, Reuters did extensive due diligence and expressed an interest in parts of the UPI service, but did not wish to maintain it in full.  Scripps wound up giving the agency away to two inexperienced businessmen, Douglas Ruhe  son of [[David Ruhe , a member of the [[Universal House of Justice , the supreme governing body of the [[Bahá'í Faith   and William Geissler, originally associated with two better-known partners, who soon departed. Ruhe and Geissler obtained UPI for $1. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Scripps first injected UPI with a $5 million cash balance, in acknowledgement of the $1.0&nbsp;&ndash; $1.5 million per month that UPI was already losing.  Facing news industry skepticism about their background and qualifications to run an international news agency, Ruhe and Geissler watched an increase in contract cancellations. Despite serious cash flow problems, they moved UPI's headquarters from New York City to Washington, DC, incurring significant additional costs due to construction cost overruns.  During this period, UPI's 25-year-old audio news actuality service for radio stations was renamed the [[United Press International Radio Network . But faced with recurring cash shortages and difficulty meeting payroll, the Ruhe-Geissler management sold UPI's foreign photo service and some rights to its US and foreign photos to the Reuters news agency.<ref name=""photo accord""/> It also sold UPI's U.S. photo library, which included the archives of predecessor Scripps photo agency Acme and the pictures and negatives of International News Photos, the picture component of Hearst's INS to the [[Bettman Archive . Bettman was later sold to Microsoft founder [[Bill Gates 's separate [[Corbis Corporation , storing them underground in Pennsylvania and digitizing them for licensing, frequently without any notation of their UPI origins. In August 2011 Corbis announced a deal with AP to distribute each other's photos to their clients, effectively combining the pre-1983 UPI library with that of its former main rival for some marketing purposes. In 2016 Corbis sold to the Visual China Group.  The London office of UPI was created during the merger with INP in 1958, previously UP did not have a UK base, and also merged the Planet News agency est.1927. The UPI London office was an early casualty in the UPI decline and the assets, including the photo archives, were sold off c.1970. TopFoto is the current owner of the remaining photo archive and copyright of the UPI London photo agency.  UPI's remaining minority stake in UPITN was also sold and the agency was renamed Worldwide Television News  WTN . As with its photographs, UPI thereby lost all control of its newsfilm and video library, which is now held by WTN-successor [[Associated Press Television News , which entered the video news field long after UPI left it.  Years of mismanagement, missed opportunities and continual wage and staff cuts followed.<ref name=""in sorrow""/> By 1984, UPI had descended into the first of two [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11   [[Mario Vázquez Raña , a Mexican media magnate, with a nominal American minority partner, Houston real estate developer Joseph Russo, purchased UPI out of bankruptcy for $40 million, losing millions during his short tenure, and firing numerous high level staff.<ref name=""in sorrow""/>  In 1988, Vázquez Raña sold UPI to Infotechnology, Inc., an information technology and venture capital company and parent company of cable TV's [[Financial News Network , both headed by [[Earl Brian , who also became UPI chairman.<ref name=""in sorrow""/> In early 1991, Infotechnology itself filed for bankruptcy, announced layoffs at UPI and sought to terminate certain employee benefits in an attempt to keep UPI afloat. At that point, UPI was down to 585 employees.<ref name=""cuts employees""/><ref name=""to file""/> Later that year, UPI filed for bankruptcy for the second time, asking for relief from $50 million in debt so that it could be sale-able.<ref name=""to file""/> In 1992, a group of [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi  investors, ARA Group International  AGI , bought the bankrupt UPI for $4 million.<ref name=""old dog""/>  By 1998, UPI had fewer than 250 employees and 12 offices.<ref name=""old dog""/> Although the Saudi-based investors claimed to have poured more than $120 million into UPI, it had failed to turn a profit.<ref name=""old dog""/> The company had begun to sell Internet-adapted products to such websites as Excite and Yahoo.<ref name=""old dog""/> At that point, UPI CEO [[Arnaud de Borchgrave  orchestrated UPI's exit from its last major media niche, the broadcast news business that United Press had initiated in the 1930s. De Borchgrave maintained that ""what was brilliant pioneering work on the part of UPI prior to World War II, with radio news, is now a static quantity and so far as I'm concerned, certainly doesn't fit into my plans for the future"". He sought to shift UPI's dwindling resources into Internet-based delivery of newsletter services, focusing more on technical and diplomatic specialties than on general news. The rump UPI thus sold the client list of its still-significant radio network and broadcast wire to its former rival, the AP.<ref name=""rip""/><ref name=""audio""/>  ===Current ownership=== [[Image:UnitedPressInternational.jpg|thumb|United Press International office in Washington D.C., circa 2005  	 UPI was purchased in May 2000 by [[News World Communications , a media conglomerate founded by [[Unification movement  founder [[Sun Myung Moon , which also owned ''[[The Washington Times '' and various newspapers in South Korea, Japan, and South America.<ref name=""staff cuts""/> The next day, UPI's [[White House  correspondent, [[Helen Thomas , resigned her position, after working for UPI for 57 years.<ref name=""fixture""/>  In 2007 as part of a restructuring to keep UPI in business and profitable, management cut 11 staff from its Washington, D.C. office and no longer has a reporter in the [[White House press corps  or a bureau covering the United Nations.<ref name=""staff cuts""/><ref name=""UN bureau""/> UPI spokespersons and press releases said the company would be focusing instead on expanding operations in the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa, and reporting on security threats, intelligence and energy issues.<ref name=""staff cuts""/><ref name=""UN bureau""/> In 2008, UPI began  UPIU, a journalism mentoring platform for students and journalism schools, that allows recent college graduates to post their work on the site, but does not pay for stories.<ref name=upiu/>  ==UPI sports awards==  United Press International conferred sports awards annually until [[1996 in sports|1996 .

''The Australian'' is owned by [[News Corp Australia .  == Parent companies == ''The Australian'' is published by [[News Corp Australia , an asset of [[News Corp  company |News Corp , which also owns the sole daily newspapers in [[Brisbane , [[Adelaide , [[Hobart  and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin , and the most circulated metropolitan daily newspapers in [[Sydney  and [[Melbourne .<ref name=""Manning""></ref> News Corp's Chairman and Founder is [[Rupert Murdoch .  ''The Australian'' integrates content from overseas newspapers owned by News Corp Australia's international parent [[News Corp  company |News Corp , including ''[[The Wall Street Journal '' and ''[[The Times '' of London.<ref name=""Manning""/>  == History == The first edition of ''The Australian'' was published by [[Rupert Murdoch  on 15 July 1964, becoming the third national newspaper in Australia following shipping newspaper ''[[Lloyd's List Australia|Daily Commercial News ''  1891  and ''[[Australian Financial Review ''  1951 . Unlike other original Murdoch newspapers, it is not a tabloid publication.<ref name=flagship></ref> At the time, a national paper was considered commercially unfeasible, as newspapers mostly relied on local advertising for their revenue. ''The Australian'' was printed in Canberra, then plates flown to other cities for copying.<ref name=""OzAt45"" /> From its inception the paper struggled for financial viability and ran at a loss for several decades.<ref name=flagship />  ''The Australian's'' first editor was [[Maxwell Newton , before leaving the newspaper within a year,<ref name=OzAt45></ref> and was succeeded by Walter Kommer, and then by [[Adrian Deamer . Under his editorship ''The Australian'' encouraged female journalists, and was the first mainstream daily newspaper to hire an Aboriginal reporter, [[John Newfong .  During the [[Australian federal election, 1975|1975 election , campaigning against the [[Whitlam Government|Whitlam government  by its owner led to the newspaper's journalists striking over editorial direction.<ref name=""OzAt45"" />  Editor-in-chief [[Chris Mitchell  journalist |Chris Mitchell  was appointed in 2002 and retired on 11 December 2015; he was replaced by [[Paul Whittaker  newspaper editor |Paul Whittaker  formerly editor-in-chief of ''[[The Daily Telegraph  Sydney |The Daily Telegraph ''.  In May 2010, the newspaper launched the first Australian newspaper [[iPad  app.<ref name=""alfi""></ref>   In October 2011 ''The Australian'' announced that it was planning to become the first general newspaper in Australia to introduce a [[paywall , with the introduction of a $2.95 per week charge for readers to view premium content on its website, mobile phone and tablet applications. The paywall was officially launched on 24 October, with a free 3 month trial.  In September 2017 ''The Australian'' launched their Chinese website.  In October 2018 it was announced that [[Chris Dore , former editor of ''The Daily Telegraph'', would be taking over as editor-in-chief.  == Coverage ==  Daily sections include National News  The Nation  followed by Worldwide News  Worldwide , Sport and Business News  Business . Contained within each issue is a prominent op/ed section, including regular columnists and non-regular contributors.  Other regular sections include Technology  AustralianIT , Media  edited by [[Darren Davidson  since 2015 , Features, Legal Affairs, Aviation, Defence, Horse-Racing  Thoroughbreds , The Arts, Health, Wealth and Higher Education. A Travel & Indulgence section is included on Saturdays, along with The Inquirer, an in-depth analysis of major stories of the week, alongside much political commentary. Saturday lift-outs include Review, focusing on books, arts, film and television, and ''The Weekend Australian Magazine'', the only national weekly glossy insert magazine.  A glossy magazine, ''Wish'', is published on the first Friday of the month.  ""''The Australian'' has long maintained a focus on issues relating to [[Australian Aboriginal|Aboriginal  disadvantage.""<ref name=""Manning""/> It also devotes attention to the [[information technology , [[Australian Defence Force|Defence  and [[mining  industries,<ref name=""Manning""/> as well as the science, economics, and politics of climate change. It has also published numerous ""special reports"" into Australian energy policy.  The ''[[Australian Literary Review '' was a monthly supplement from September 2006 to October 2011.  == Editorial and opinion pages ==   Former editor [[Paul Kelly  journalist |Paul Kelly  stated in 1991 that ""''The Australian'' has established itself in the marketplace as a newspaper that strongly supports economic libertarianism"". Laurie Clancy asserted in 2004 that the newspaper ""is generally conservative in tone and heavily oriented toward business; it has a range of columnists of varying political persuasions but mostly to the right."" Former editor-in-chief Chris Mitchell has said that the editorial and op-ed pages of the newspaper are [[centre-right .   In 2007 ''[[Crikey '' described the newspaper as generally in support of the Liberal Party and the then-Coalition government, but has pragmatically supported Labor governments in the past as well.<ref name="":0""></ref> This was seen during the 2007 Federal election when The Australian strongly supported [[Kevin Rudd 's Labor Party and their policies.  However Crikey.com said this about the The Australian. ""The truth is we are not so interested in one side of politics or the other. We advocate a set of principles that have motivated us for 40 years: an open economy, markets, international engagement, reform of the federation and labour market deregulation"".  In fact, ''The Australian'' presents varying views on [[climate change , publishing articles by those who disagree with the scientific consensus such as [[Ian Plimer , and authors who agree with the scientific consensus such as [[Tim Flannery  and [[Bjørn Lomborg . A 2011 study of the previous seven years of articles claimed that four out of every five articles were opposed to taking action on climate change. The Australian also exposed the Children overboard affair and pursued the Coalition government over the [[AWB oil-for-wheat scandal .   In 2010 the ABC's ''Media Watch'' presenter [[Paul Barry  accused ''The Australian'' of waging a campaign against the [[Australian Greens , and the Greens' federal leader [[Bob Brown  wrote that ''The Australian'' has ""stepped out of the [[fourth estate  by seeing itself as a determinant of democracy in Australia."" In response, ''The Australian'' opined that ""Greens leader Bob Brown has accused ''The Australian'' of trying to wreck the alliance between the Greens and Labor. We wear Senator Brown's criticism with pride. We believe he and his Green colleagues are hypocrites; that they are bad for the nation; and that they should be destroyed at the ballot box.""<ref name=""GunningForTheGreens""></ref>  ''The Australian'' has been criticised by some media commentators for helping to promote a right wing agenda, and encouraging political polarisation in Australia.<ref name="":3""></ref><ref name="":4""></ref><ref name="":5""></ref>    ===Notable stories===  ====AWB kickback scandal==== [[Caroline Overington , a senior journalist writing for ''The Australian'' reported in 2005 about the [[Australian Wheat Board  funnelling hundreds of millions of dollars to Iraq and the government of [[Saddam Hussein  before the start of the [[Iraq War . This story became known as the [[AWB oil-for-wheat scandal , and resulted in a commission of inquiry into the matter. Overington received a [[Walkley Awards|Walkley award  for her coverage. ====AWU Affair====  		 In 2011 [[Glenn Milne  reported on the allegations against Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard  concerning the [[AWU affair  including a claim regarding Gillard's living arrangements with [[Australian Workers' Union  official Bruce Wilson. Gillard contacted the chief executive of ''The Australian'', resulting in the story being removed and an apology and retraction posted in its place.<ref name=Bombshell></ref>   On 18 August 2012 [[Hedley Thomas  reported that Gillard had left her job as a partner with law firm [[Slater and Gordon Lawyers|Slater and Gordon  as a direct result of a secret internal investigation in 1995 into corrupt conduct on behalf of her then-boyfriend Ralph Blewett. The story was ignored for a long time by other media outlets until after Gillard held a press conference to respond to the allegations against her. In 2013 the [[Fair Work Commission  commenced initial inquiries into allegations of improper union financial conduct, and the government initiated a judicial inquiry into the [[AWU affair  in December of that year as part of a royal commission into trade unions.  ====''The Teacher’s Pet''==== [[The Teacher's Pet|''The Teachers Pet'' , an investigation into the [[disappearance of Lynette Dawson , is a podcast written by [[Hedley Thomas  and Slade Gibson that ran in 2018. It was credited with generating new leads that led to the subsequent arrest of [[Chris Dawson  rugby league |Chris Dawson  for the murder of his wife,and the setting up of police enquiry Strike Force Southwood to explore claims of sexual assaults and student-teacher relationships at several Sydney high schools brought up on the podcast. The series has had 28 million downloads,<ref name="":1""></ref> was the number one Australian podcast and reached number one in the UK, Canada and New Zealand.<ref name=""last""></ref>  Both Hedley and Gibson received [[Gold Walkley|Gold Walkley awards  for their work on the series.  === Columnists and contributors ===  Regular columnists include [[Janet Albrechtsen , [[Troy Bramston , [[Paul Kelly  journalist |Paul Kelly , [[Chris Kenny  journalist |Chris Kenny , [[Brendan O'Neill  journalist |Brendan O'Neill , [[Nicolas Rothwell , [[Imre Salusinszky , [[Niki Savva , [[Angela Shanahan , [[Dennis Shanahan , [[Greg Sheridan , [[Judith Sloan , [[Emma Jane , [[Peter van Onselen , [[Graham Richardson  and [[Phillip Adams .

Former cartoonists include [[Bill Leak .  == Australian of the Year Award ==   In 1971, T''he Australian'' instituted their own ""Australian of the Year award"" separate from and often different to the [[Australian of the Year  chosen by the government's [[National Australia Day Council . Starting in 1968, the official award had long had links to the Victorian Australia Day Council, and at the time there was a public perception it was state based. As a national newspaper, ''The Australian'' felt they were better situated to create an award that more truly represented all of Australia. Nominees are suggested by readers, decided upon by an editorial board, and awarded in January of every year.    ==Circulation== As of March 2015, the weekday edition circulation was 104,165 and the weekend edition was 230,182, falling 6.5 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively compared to the same period in 2014.

From 1967 until the late 1980s, the magazine featured the writings of authors such as [[Thomas Sowell , [[Tom Wolfe , [[P.J. O'Rourke , [[George F. Will , [[Malcolm Gladwell , [[Patrick J. Buchanan , and [[Malcolm Muggeridge . During the 1990s, the magazine was better known for its reports on [[Bill Clinton  and its ""[[Arkansas Project ,"" funded by businessman [[Richard Mellon Scaife  and the [[Bradley Foundation . ''The American Spectator'' has carried articles by Thomas Sowell, a regular column by economist and celebrity [[Ben Stein , as well as former Reagan aide [[Jeffrey Lord , conservative health care consultant David Catron, and editorial director [[Wladyslaw Pleszczynski , as well as occasional articles by P.J. O'Rourke.  ==Founding and history== ''The American Spectator'' was founded in 1924 by [[George Jean Nathan  and [[Truman Handy Newberry|Truman Newberry .  In 1967, the Saturday Evening Club took it over and renamed it '''''The Alternative: An American Spectator'''''.  After operating under the name ''The Alternative: An American Spectator'' for several years, in 1977 the magazine changed its name to ''The American Spectator'' because, in editor Tyrrell's words, ""the word 'alternative' had come to be associated almost exclusively with radicals and with their way of life.""  In fact, Tyrrell had started the magazine on the campus of [[Indiana University Bloomington  in 1967 as a conservative alternative to the [[student  [[Radicalization|radicalism  at the nation's universities in the 1960s. ''American Spectator'' is not affiliated with ''[[The Spectator '', a British magazine of somewhat similar format and conservatism.  During the [[Reagan Administration , the magazine moved from [[Bloomington, Indiana  to suburban [[Washington, D.C.   ==1990s ==  The publication gained prominence in the 1990s by reporting on [[political scandal s. The March 1992 issue contained [[David Brock 's criticisms of [[Clarence Thomas  accuser [[Anita Hill . Brock and his colleague [[Daniel Wattenberg  soon aimed at a bigger target: [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary  and [[Bill Clinton .  A January 1994 article about then-President Bill Clinton's sex life contained the first reference in print to Clinton accuser [[Paula Jones , although the article focused on allegations that Clinton used [[Arkansas State Police|Arkansas state troopers  to facilitate his extramarital sexual activities  ''see'' [[Troopergate  Bill Clinton |Troopergate  .  It only referred to Jones by her first name and corroborated few if any elements of her story. This article was the basis for the claim of damages in a [[sexual harassment  lawsuit, which started the chain of events resulting in [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|President Clinton's impeachment .  [[David Brock  recanted his accusations upon his departure from the conservative movement. He also denounced his Anita Hill article in his 2003 book ''[[Blinded by the Right|Blinded by the Right: the Conscience of an Ex-Conservative ''. He implies that [[Rush Limbaugh 's coverage of his Anita Hill article instigated advertising on Limbaugh's network, which resulted in a large increase in the magazine's circulation. He also implies that this caused the magazine's content to move ""away from thoughtful essays and scholarly reviews and humor pieces"" to ""hit jobs.""  For his part, Wattenberg eventually incurred the displeasure of many fellow conservatives when he belatedly admitted that he had killed a story about rumors of Clinton fathering a child out of wedlock as a result of his relationship with a young [[African American  woman. Wattenberg actually tracked down a videotape of the woman being interviewed by an unnamed third party who asked her what Wattenberg described as ""softball"" questions, but he never was able to interview her himself.  Wattenberg's rationales for killing the story were that he had no proof that the story was true and that the woman's testimony was unconvincing. He said that she ""seemed like a junkie."" The story was revived in 1999 by [[Matt Drudge .  Internal strife eventually led to the departure of long-time publisher [[Ronald Burr  after a disagreement with Tyrrell led Burr to call for an independent audit of the magazine's finances. The departure of Burr and several prominent conservative figures from the magazine's board of directors resulted in conservative foundations pulling much of the funding the nonprofit had relied on to pay high salaries to Brock and Tyrrell, as well as to fund [[advertising mail#Direct mail marketing|direct-mail campaign s needed to keep up the monthly's circulation. Faced with a budget crisis, the magazine, then led by publisher [[Terry Eastland , a former spokesman in the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan  [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department , laid off staffers and cut spending significantly.   The magazine also struggled to pay legal bills incurred from an investigation launched against it by the Justice Department for alleged witness tampering in the [[Whitewater  controversy |Whitewater investigation .  The Justice Department investigation led to revelations about the ""[[Arkansas Project ,"" a campaign by businessman [[Richard Mellon Scaife  to discredit the Clintons by funding investigative reporting at several conservative media outlets.  ==2000s== As shortfalls continued, [[George Gilder , a longtime supporter of the magazine, who was newly wealthy from an [[Internet business , purchased the magazine with the goal of turning it into a profit-making glossy with significant media buzz.  Numerous staff members, demoralized by the ever-looming budget crises, were laid off or departed after [[Joshua Gilder  and [[Richard Vigilante  took the reins and vowed to reach a new technology- and business-savvy audience. Circulation and budget losses continued and even increased in the Gilder era, and at one point the entire Washington-based staff, other than Tyrrell and executive editor and web site editor [[Wladyslaw Pleszczynski , were laid off as operations were moved to [[Massachusetts , where the rest of George Gilder's businesses were based. In 2003, George Gilder, who had lost most of his fortune with the bursting of the [[Internet stock bubble , sold the magazine for $1 back to Tyrrell and the American Alternative Foundation, the magazine's original owner.  Later, the name of the owner was changed to the American Spectator Foundation. The magazine then moved operations back to the Washington, D.C. area. Later that year, former book publisher [[Alfred S. Regnery  became the magazine's publisher. By 2004, circulation hovered at around 50,000.  ==2010s== In 2013, the magazine reverted to a [[Tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid  format, reflecting the roots of the magazine, which was originally published at a large size. For most of the 1990s and all of the 2000s the ''Spectator'' had been published in a traditional [[magazine  format.  In 2011, Assistant Editor [[Patrick Howley  published a piece detailing his infiltration of a [[Washington, D.C.  protest.  In the article, Howley asserts his aim to ""mock and undermine"" the protest against [[American Imperialism , and writes in the first person about his experiences protesting at the [[National Air and Space Museum . This article, and the methods detailed within, was condemned by two left-leaning publications  ''The Guardian'' and ''The Atlantic Monthly'''s ""Atlantic Wire"" blog, and one economically conservative publication  ''The Economist'' , because they believed the correspondents who worked on the story had conflated journalism and politics. Matt Steinglass of ''The Economist'' wrote that Howley ""winds up offering a vision of politics as a kind of self-focused performance art, or perhaps  to say the same thing  a version of [[Jackass  TV series |''Jackass'' .""  ==Online publication==  The magazine's final monthly print publication was released in July/August 2014. While the Spectator did issue a September/October PDF-only version late in mid-November 2014, the masthead still claimed that it was ""published monthly, except for combined July/Aug and Jan/Feb issues."" A note from Editorial Director Wlady Pleszczynski admitted that ""...we have some problems of our own."" Pleszczynski added that the issue ""was ready for release well over a month ago but for reasons affecting many a print publication these days couldn't be published on actual pages and after considerable delay is now being released in digital form only.""

The '''''Lincoln Star''''', established in 1905, was Lincoln's morning newspaper while the '''''Lincoln Journal''''' was distributed in the evenings.

In 1937, J.C. Seacrest created a trust which ensured that the ''Journal'' would remain in the possession of the Seacrest family throughout the lifetimes of his sons, Joe W. and Fred S. Seacrest, and their children.<ref name="":1"" /> However, financial realities forced greater cooperation between the ''Journal'' and ''Star'' and in 1950, the State Journal Printing Company and Star Printing Company merged into the Journal-Star Printing Company.<ref name="":1"" /> Despite being owned by the same company and sharing offices and production facilities, the publications maintained competing news teams and ran separate stories.<ref name="":1"" /> In 1971, Joe W. Seacrest chose his son Joe R.

The magazine was founded in 2001 as a successor to ''[[Living Marxism '' and has been characterised as [[libertarian  ""with a moderate right wing bias"".  == Editors and contributors ==  ''Spiked'' is edited by [[Brendan O'Neill  journalist |Brendan O'Neill ,<ref name = FAQ></ref> following [[Mick Hume 's departure in January 2007, and features regular contributions from [[James Heartfield , [[Michael Fitzpatrick  physician |Michael Fitzpatrick , [[Patrick West , Rob Lyons, Nathalie Rothschild, Tim Black, Duleep Allirajah, Tom Slater, Joanna Williams and [[Frank Furedi .  == Origin == The magazine was founded in 2000 after the [[bankruptcy  of its predecessor, ''[[Living Marxism ''  ''LM'' .<ref name="":0""></ref>  ''LM'' closed after losing a [[English defamation law|libel  case brought against it by the broadcasting corporation [[ITN . The case centred around ITN coverage of [[Fikret Alić  and other Bosnian Muslims standing behind a barbed-wire fence at the [[Trnopolje camp  during the [[Yugoslav war . ''LM'' opposed Western intervention on traditional anti-imperialist grounds, and thus warned against the tendency to moralise the conflict – with Muslims portrayed as the victims and [[Serbs  as the villains – which was fuelling the clamour for military action. ''LM'' published an article titled ""The Picture that Fooled the World"" which claimed that ITN's coverage was deceptive, the barbed-wire did not enclose the camp and the Muslims were in fact ""refugees, many of whom went there seeking safety and could leave again if they wished."" During the court case, evidence given by the camp doctor led ''LM'' to abandon its defence. ITN was awarded damages and costs, estimated to be around £1 million.  == Stance == ''Spiked'' focuses on issues of freedom and state control, science and technology, culture, education and literature.  The magazine opposes all forms of censorship, by the state or otherwise. Its writers call for a repeal of [[libel , [[hate speech  and [[incitement  laws, and of censorship on university campuses  e.g. [[No Platform  . They have criticised laws targeted at paedophiles as counterproductive to rehabilitation and conducive to mob violence. ''Spiked'' also regularly critiques [[risk society , [[political correctness , and [[environmentalism .<ref name=""DarkMoney""></ref> As regards the latter, a particular ''Spiked'' target has been what they see as ""exaggerated"" and ""hysterical"" interpretations of the scientific consensus on [[global warming , and what they argue are double standards advocated by more advanced Western nations for self-serving reasons.<ref name=""Woudhuysen and Kaplinsky""></ref>  ''Spiked'' opposed the post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11  invasions [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|of Afghanistan  and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|of Iraq  and Western interference in [[developing nations  in general. It seeks to counter what it sees as a recent trend in Western foreign policy: [[humanitarian intervention .  George Monbiot has said that ''Spiked'''s stance has more in common with right wing libertarianism than with the mainstream left.  Frank Furedi, interviewed in ''Spiked'', responded that the stance of ''LM'' and ''Spiked'' springs from the tradition of the ""[[anti-Stalinist left "". He argued that the reason why many in the left tradition have difficulties in identifying these ideas with the left is that they completely misunderstand the humanist political position of being progressive in terms of human progress, science, rationality and freedom, and yet be completely anti-state:  <blockquote>...much of the left in the twentieth century tended to be influenced by Stalinist and Social-Democratic traditions, which means they could not imagine that you could be left-wing and anti-state...so they were confused by us. But that was their fault, not ours. It was a product of their own abandonment of liberty in favour of ideas about state control.<ref name=""O'Neill""></ref></blockquote>  Environmentalists such as [[George Monbiot <ref name=""DarkMoney""/> and [[Peter Melchett  have suggested that the group of writers associated with ''LM'', several of whom went on to form the core editorial group at Spiked, continue to constitute a 'LM Network' pursuing an ideologically motivated '[[Anti-environmentalism|anti-environmentalist ' agenda under the guise of promoting [[Humanism . Writers who used to write for ''Living Marxism'' reject this as a 'McCarthyite' conspiracy theory. Monbiot described their views as having, ""less in common with the left than with the fanatical right.""<ref name=""Monbiot""></ref>  ==''Spiked Review of Books''== [[Image:SRB masthead.gif|thumb|right   The ''Spiked Review of Books'' is a monthly online [[literary criticism  feature, based at ''Spiked''. The launch in May 2007 coincided with controversy in the United States following the scaling back of newspaper [[book review  sections. The ''Spiked Review of Books'' features editorials by Brendan O'Neill and interviews, essays and reviews by a range of writers, many of whom are regular contributors to ''Spiked'', such as Frank Furedi, Jennie Bristow and Josie Appleton. The cover illustrations are by Jan Bowman.  == Funding ==  Spiked US Inc. has received funding from the [[Charles Koch Foundation . .<ref name="""" group=""""></ref> Reporter [[George Monbiot  suggested that this was due to its  the online magazine's  attacks on left-wing politics, its support of hard right or far right figures, and the many articles it publishes by writers supported by the [[Institute for Economic Affairs  and the Koch funded [[Cato Institute .<ref name=""Monbiot""></ref>  ==References==  <!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref erences/ > tags-->   ==External links== *[http://www.spiked-online.com/ ''Sp!ked'' Online] *[http://www.spiked-online.com/freespeechnow Free speech now!] - a ''sp!ked'' project *[http://www.frankfuredi.com Frank Furedi official website] *[http://www.woudhuysen.com James Woudhuysen website] *[http://www.heartfield.org/ James Heartfield website]   [[Category:2000 establishments in the United Kingdom  [[Category:British online magazines  [[Category:British political magazines  [[Category:Climate change skepticism and denial  [[Category:Freedom of speech in the United Kingdom  [[Category:Magazines established in 2000  [[Category:Organizations of environmentalism skeptics and critics  [[Category:Politics and technology ","Spiked  also written as sp!ked  is a British Internet magazine focusing on politics, culture and society.

It was founded by political pundit [[Tucker Carlson  and [[Neil Patel  political advisor |Neil Patel  in 2010.  == History == ''The Daily Caller'' was founded by [[Tucker Carlson  and [[Neil Patel  political advisor |Neil Patel . After raising $3 million in funding from businessman [[Foster Friess , the website was launched on January 11, 2010. The organization started with a reporting staff of 21 in its Washington office. It was launched as an alternative to the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal  ''[[The Huffington Post '', similarly featuring sections in broad range of subjects beyond politics.  By late 2012, ''[[The New York Times '' reported that the site had quadrupled its page view and total audience and had become profitable without ever buying an advertisement for itself.<ref name=""Stelter""></ref>  By 2013, the site was receiving over 35 million views a month according to Quantcast, surpassing rival sites such as ''[[The Washington Times '', [[Politico , and [[Forbes .<ref name=""The Daily Caller""></ref> The site has an active community, with over 200,000 comments made each month.  Notable figures have commented on ''The Daily Caller''. [[Karl Rove  has said that ""''The Daily Caller'' is necessary reading for anyone who wants to be up to speed with what's going on with politics in America."" [[Lawrence Kudlow|Larry Kudlow  referred to the site as ""one of [his] faves.""<ref name=""The Daily Caller""/>  == Staff and contributors == [[File:Tucker Carlson by Gage Skidmore.jpg|150px|thumb|''Daily Caller'' co-founder Tucker Carlson  ''The Daily Caller'' is in the White House rotating [[press pool  and has full-time reporters on Capitol Hill. Notable contributors include [[Ann Coulter .<ref name=DC></ref>  Contributors to ''The Daily Caller'' include economist [[Larry Kudlow , Congressman [[Mark Sanford , sculptor [[Robert Mihaly , and diplomat [[Alan Keyes .  ''The Daily Caller'' also hosts ''The Mirror'', a blog written by former FishbowlDC editor and ''[[The Hill  newspaper |The Hill '' columnist Betsy Rothstein. ''The Mirror'' covers [[Media in Washington, D.C.|media in Washington D.C. , news related to journalism organizations, as well as political and media related gossip. The tagline is, ""Reflections of a self-obsessed city.""  == Political stance == When it first launched in January 2010, [[Mercedes Bunz , writing for ''[[The Guardian '', said ''The Daily Caller'' was ""setting itself up to be the conservative answer to ''[[The Huffington Post ''"". According to Bunz, a year before the website launched, Carlson promoted it as ""a new political website leaning more to the right than ''[[Politico '' and ''[[TalkingPointsMemo ''"". However, at launch, he wrote a letter to readers that said it was not going to be a right-wing site.  During a January 2010 interview with ''Politico'', Carlson said ''The Daily Caller'' was not going to be tied to his personal political ideologies and that he wanted it to be ""breaking stories of importance"". In a ''[[Washington Post '' article about ''The Caller''s launch, [[Howard Kurtz  wrote, ""[Carlson's] partner is Neil Patel, a former Dick Cheney aide. His opinion editor is Moira Bagley, who spent 2008 as the Republican National Committee's press secretary. And his $3 million in funding comes from Wyoming financier Foster Friess, a big-time GOP donor. But Carlson insists this won't be a right-wing site"". Kurtz quoted Carlson as saying, ""We're not enforcing any kind of ideological orthodoxy on anyone"". In an interview with ''[[The New York Times '', Carlson said that the vast majority of traditional reporting comes from a liberal point of view and called  ''The Daily Caller''s reporting ""the balance against the rest of the conventional press"".<ref name=""Stelter""/>  In a 2012 ''[[The Washingtonian  magazine |Washingtonian '' article, Tom Bartlett said Carlson and Patel developed ''The Daily Caller'' as ""a conservative news site in the mold of the liberal ''[[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post '' but with more firearms coverage and fewer nipple-slip slide shows"".  == Controversies ==  === Climate change denial === ''The Daily Caller'' has published a number of articles that dispute the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus on climate change .<ref name="":4""></ref> In 2017, ''The Daily Caller'' published a story falsely claiming that a ""peer-reviewed study"" by ""two scientists and a veteran statistician"" found that recent years have not been the warmest ever.<ref name="":5""></ref> The alleged ""study"" was a PDF file on a WordPress blog, and was neither peer-reviewed nor published in a scientific journal.<ref name="":5"" /> Also in 2017, ''The Daily Caller'' uncritically published a bogus ''Daily Mail'' story which claimed that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  manipulated data to make climate change appear worse; at the same time, legitimate news outlets debunked the ''Daily Mail'' story. Also in 2017, ''The Daily Caller'' published a story claiming that a study found no evidence of accelerating temperatures over a 23-year period, which climate scientists described as a misleading story.<ref name="":4"" /> In 2016, ''The Daily Caller'' published a story claiming that climate scientist [[Michael E. Mann|Michael Mann   director of the Earth System Science Center at [[Pennsylvania State University   had asserted that data was unnecessary to measure climate change; Mann described the story as ""egregiously false"". In 2015, ''The Daily Caller'' wrote that NOAA ""fiddle[d]"" with data when the agency published a report concluding that there was no global warming hiatus.  === Misleading video about NPR === In 2011, ''The Daily Caller'' was the first news outlet to disseminate a video by conservative provocateur [[James O'Keefe  which purportedly showed an NPR fundraiser deriding Republicans. The video was later proven to have been misleadingly edited.  === False prostitution allegations === In March 2013 ''The Daily Caller'' posted interviews with two women claiming that New Jersey [[Democratic Party  United States |Democratic  Senator [[Bob Menendez  had paid them for sex while he was a guest of a campaign donor. The allegation came five days before the [[United States Senate election in New Jersey, 2012|2012 New Jersey senate election .  News organizations such as [[ABC News , which had also interviewed the women, ''[[The New York Times '', and the ''[[New York Post '' declined to publish the allegations, viewing them as unsubstantiated and lacking credibility.<ref name=""abc-says""></ref><ref name=""nyt-partisan""></ref><ref name=""atlantic-post""></ref> Subsequently, one of the women who accused Menendez stated that she had been paid to falsely implicate the senator and had never met him.<ref name=""abc-says""/><ref name=""wapo-madeup""></ref> Menendez's office described the allegations as ""manufactured"" by a right-wing blog as a politically motivated smear.  A few weeks later, police in the Dominican Republic announced that three women had claimed they were paid $300–425 each to lie about having had sex with Menendez. Dominican law enforcement also alleged that the women had been paid to lie about Menendez by an individual claiming to work for ''The Daily Caller''. ''The Daily Caller'' denied this allegation, stating: ""At no point did any money change hands between ''The Daily Caller'' and any sources or individuals connected with this investigation"".<ref name=""wp-lie""></ref> Describing what it saw as the unraveling of ''The Daily Caller'' ""scoop"", the [[Poynter Institute  wrote: ""''The Daily Caller'' stands by its reports, though apparently doesn't feel the need to ''prove its allegations right''.<ref name=""poynter"">s Menendez prostitution 'scoop' unravels | access-date = August 26, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924115514/http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/206340/the-daily-callers-menendez-prostitution-scoop-unravels/# | archive-date = September 24, 2015 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all  </ref>  === Fox News controversy === In March 2015 ''The Daily Caller'' columnist [[Mickey Kaus  quit after editor [[Tucker Carlson  refused to run a column critical of [[Fox News  coverage of the immigration policy debate. Carlson, who also works for Fox, reportedly did not want ''The Daily Caller'' publishing criticism of a firm that employed him. Journalist Neil Munro quit two weeks later and Carlson said he was not going to go to work for Breitbart. However, he started writing for Breitbart four months later and has remained there, as of November 2018.  === 2016 presidential election === According to a study by [[Harvard University|Harvard University's  [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society|Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society , ''The Daily Caller'' was among the most popular sites on the right during the 2016 presidential election. The study also found that ''The Daily Caller'' provided ""amplification and legitimation"" for ""the most extreme conspiracy sites"", such as Truthfeed, Infowars, Gateway Pundit and Conservative Treehouse during the 2016 presidential election.<ref name="":32""></ref> ''The Daily Caller'' also ""employed anti-immigrant narratives that echoed sentiments from the alt-right and white nationalists but without the explicitly racist and pro-segregation language.""<ref name="":32"" /> ''The Daily Caller'' also played a significant role in creating and disseminating stories that had little purchase outside the right-wing media ecosystem but that stoked the belief among core Trump followers that what Clinton did was not merely questionable but criminal and treasonous. In a campaign that expressed deep anti-Muslim sentiment, a repeated theme was that Hillary Clinton was seriously in hock to Muslim nations.<ref name="":32"" /> In one of its most frequently shared stories, ''The Daily Caller'' falsely asserted that Morocco's King Mohammed VI flew Bill Clinton on a private jet, and that this had been omitted from the Clinton Foundation's tax disclosures.<ref name="":32"" /> ''The Daily Caller'' also made the ""utterly unsubstantiated and unsourced claim"" that Hillary Clinton got Environmental Protection Agency ""head Lisa Jackson to try to shut down Mosaic Fertilizer, described as America’s largest phosphate mining company, in exchange for a $15 million donation to the Clinton Foundation from King Mohammed VI of Morocco, ostensibly to benefit Morocco’s state-owned phosphate company.""<ref name="":32"" />  === Encouragement of violence against protesters === In January 2017, ''The Daily Caller'' posted a video which encouraged violence against protesters.<ref name="":0""></ref><ref name="":2""></ref> The video in question showed a car plowing through protesters, with the headline ""Here's A Reel Of Cars Plowing Through Protesters Trying To Block The Road"" and set to a cover of [[Ludacris ' ""[[Move Bitch .""<ref name="":0"" /> The video drew attention in August 2017 when a white supremacist [[Charlottesville car attack|plowed his car through a group of counterprotesters  at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville.<ref name="":0"" /> After the video attracted attention, ''The Daily Caller'' deleted it from its website.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":2"" />  The [[Southern Poverty Law Center  subsequently criticized ''The Daily Caller'', saying that it had a ""white nationalist problem"".<ref name="":1""></ref> SPLC also said that two other contributors to ''The Daily Caller'' had ties to white nationalist groups.<ref name="":1"" /> It later retracted its claim that Richard Pollock, a devout Jew, was a white nationalist, saying ""Pollock was initially included in this story"" but ""there is no evidence to suggest Mr. Pollock is otherwise a white nationalist.""<ref name="":1"" />  === Ties to white supremacists === In August 2018, ''The Atlantic'' reported that Scott Greer, then deputy editor of ''The Daily Caller'', had written pieces under a pseudonym ""Michael McGregor"" in the white supremacist publication ''Radix Journal'' from 2014 to 2015''.'' In articles for ''Radix Journal'', Greer expressed [[white nationalist  views, as well as racist [[Negrophobia|anti-black  and [[antisemitic  views. While in his emails and messages, he expressed anti-Christian and antisemitic theories, as well his relationship with [[Richard B. Spencer|Richard Spencer .<ref name=""Gray""></ref> Upon being confronted with his past white supremacist writings, Greer resigned from any affiliation with ''The Daily Caller''.<ref name=""Gray""/> In 2017, it had been revealed, Scott Greer  had ties to members of the white nationalist movement, including friendships with Devin Saucier, assistant to [[Jared Taylor  of [[American Renaissance , and anti-immigrant activist Marcus Epstein of [[VDare , who pled guilty to assaulting an African American woman two years prior to the relationship with Scott Greer.<ref name=""salon1"">[https://www.salon.com/2017/08/21/the-daily-caller-has-a-white-nationalist-problem_partner The Daily Caller has a white nationalist problem] August 21, 2017, STEPHEN PIGGOTT, ALEX AMEND, Salon</ref> Greer had later deleted parts of his Facebook page, but is seen photographed with nationalists such as Tim Dionisopoulos and [[Richard B. Spencer|Richard Spencer , [[Wolves of Vinland  and appears wearing clothes belonging to the group [[Youth for Western Civilization .<ref name=""salon1""/>  The Daily Caller itself subsequently stated, about why he had not been fired in 2017: “We had two choices: Fire a young man because of some photos taken of him at metal shows in college, or take his word. We chose to trust him. Now, if what you allege is accurate, we know that trust was a mistake, we know he lied to us. We won’t publish him, anyone in these circles, or anyone who thinks like them. People who associate with these losers have no business writing for our company.” <ref name=""Gray""/>  ''The Daily Caller'' has posted articles by [[Jason Kessler , a white supremacist who organized [[Unite the Right rally|a rally of hundreds of white nationalists in Charlottesville . Before Kessler posted his article, he had spoken at white supremacist gatherings. After Kessler received attention for his organizing of the Charlottesville white supremacist rally, ''The Daily Caller'' removed his articles from its website, but ''The Daily Caller'' executive editor defended Kessler's articles.  The website has also published pieces by [[Peter Brimelow , founder of the white supremacist website [[VDARE .<ref name=""salon1""/>  === Heckling of Obama === In 2012, ''Daily Caller'' reporter Neil Munro interrupted Barack Obama during one of the President's press conferences, while Obama was giving remarks. Obama said, ""The next time I prefer you let me finish my statements before you ask a question."" Cutting off Munro's reply, Obama said, ""I didn't ask for an argument.""<ref name=""theatlantic.com"">https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/06/who-neil-munro-and-why-he-interrupting-president-united-states/326859/</ref> Munro's interruption of remarks by the president was widely considered a startling breach of etiquette. Editor-in-chief Tucker Carlson defended Munro's heckling, saying ""As a general matter, reporters are there to ask [questions]"" and that he was ""proud"" of Munro.  Munro later said in a statement that his intention was to ask questions after the president made his remarks, but he claimed to have misjudged when the president was closing. ""I timed the question believing the president was closing his remarks, because naturally I have no intention of interrupting the President of the United States. I know he rarely takes questions before walking away from the podium. When I asked the question as he finished his speech, he turned his back on the many reporters, and walked away while I and at least one other reporter asked questions.""<ref name=""theatlantic.com""/>  === Stefan Halper === ''The Daily Caller'' was the first news outlet to report on Stefan Halper, a confidential FBI source, and his interactions with Trump campaign advisors [[Carter Page  and [[George Papadopoulos . Papadopoulos later pleaded guilty to lying to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI  about campaign matters. Page became the subject of surveillance warrants issued by the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court  regarding his alleged contacts with Russian intelligence officials. Other news outlets confirmed Halper's identity but did not report his identity because US intelligence officials warned that it would endanger him and his contacts.  === Allegation of non-profit abuse === According to Callum Borchers of ''The Washington Post'', ''The Daily Caller'' has ""a peculiar business structure that enables it to increase revenue while reducing its tax obligation."" The organization, a for-profit company, does this by relying on its charity arm, ''The Daily Caller'' News Foundation, to create the majority of its news content.  According to Lisa Graves, a deputy assistant attorney general in the Clinton administration, the situation is “a huge rip-off for taxpayers if ''The Daily Caller'' News Foundation is receiving revenue that it doesn't pay taxes on, to produce stories that are used by the for-profit enterprise, which then makes money on the stories through ads.”  === Imran Awan === ''The Daily Caller'' kept conspiracy theories surrounding [[Imran Awan  alive with aggressive coverage.<ref name="":02""></ref><ref name="":12""></ref> Imran Awan was an IT worker for [[Democratic Party  United States |Democrats  in the [[U.S. House of Representatives . ''The'' ''Daily Caller'' sought  to tie Awan to a wide range of alleged criminal activity, including unauthorized access to government servers.<ref name="":3""></ref> The reporter behind the aggressive coverage of Awan told Fox News that the affair was ""straight out of James Bond.""<ref name="":3"" /> An 18-month investigation by federal prosecutors found no evidence of wrongdoing in Awan's work in the House and no support for the conspiracy theories about Awan. In the announcement of the conclusion of the investigation, investigators rebuked a litany of right-wing conspiracy theories about Awan.<ref name="":02"" /><ref name="":12"" />  === Chinese email hacking === In August 2018, ''The Daily Caller'' ran a story alleging that a Chinese-owned company hacked then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server and successfully obtained nearly all of her emails. The Daily Caller cited “two sources briefed on the matter.” After publishing the story, President Trump tweeted the allegations made in ''Daily Caller''<nowiki/>'s reporting. The FBI rebutted the allegations. According to ''The Washington Post'', the claims are without evidence.  === Fake nude picture of Ocasio-Cortez === In January 2019, ''The Daily Caller'' published a story with the misleading headline ""Here’s The Photo Some Described As A Nude Selfie Of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez."" The photo was not of Ocasio-Cortez. Ocasio-Cortez condemned ''The Daily Caller''<nowiki/>'s action as ""completely disgusting behavior."" ''The Daily Caller'' apologized for the headline, and changed it. ''The Daily Caller'' said that the content of the story was not unlike stories published by Vice and Huffington Post. Vice had published an article debunking that the photo belonged to Ocasio-Cortez.  === Article on Media Matters and David Brock === In February 2012, The Daily Caller published an ""investigative series"" of articles co-authored by Carlson, purporting to be an insiders' exposé of [[Media Matters for America   MMfA , a liberal watchdog group that monitors and scrutinizes conservative media outlets, and its founder [[David Brock . Citing ""current and former"" MMfA employees, ""friends"" of Brock's and a ""prominent liberal"" — none of whom are named — the article characterized MMfA as having ""an atmosphere of tension and paranoia"" and portraying Brock as ""erratic, unstable and disturbing,"" who ""struggles with mental illness,"" in fear of ""right-wing assassins,"" a regular cocaine user and would ""close [local bars] and party till six in the morning."" [[Reuters  media critic and libertarian [[Jack Shafer , while noting ""I’ve never thought much of Media Matters’ style of watchdogging or Brock’s journalism,"" nevertheless sharply criticized the Daily Caller piece as ""anonymously sourced crap,"" adding ""Daily Caller is attacking Media Matters with bad journalism and lame propaganda.""  == Awards ==  *2012 [[Edward R.

CNN was founded in 1980 by American [[media proprietor  [[Ted Turner  as a [[United States cable news|24-hour cable news  channel. Upon its launch, CNN was the first television channel to provide [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour news coverage ,<ref name=CNNtaipei></ref> and was the first all-news television channel in the United States.<ref name=CNN20></ref>  While the news channel has numerous [[Network affiliate|affiliates , CNN primarily broadcasts from the [[Time Warner Center  in [[New York City , and studios in [[Washington, D.C.  and [[Los Angeles . Its headquarters at the [[CNN Center  in [[Atlanta  is only used for weekend programming. CNN is sometimes referred to as '''CNN/U.S.'''  or '''CNN Domestic'''  to distinguish the American channel from its international sister network, [[CNN International .  , CNN is available in over 100 million U.S. households.<ref name=""CNNdeal""></ref> Broadcast coverage of the U.S. channel extends to over 890,000 American hotel rooms,<ref name=""CNNdeal""/> as well as carriage on subscription providers throughout [[Canada . , CNN is available to about 96,374,000 pay-television households  82.8% of households with at least one television set  in the United States. Globally, CNN programming airs through CNN International, which can be seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories.  ==History==  ===Early history===  The Cable News Network was launched at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time  on June 1, 1980. After an introduction by [[Ted Turner , the husband and wife team of [[David Walker  journalist |David Walker  and [[Lois Hart  anchored the channel's first newscast. [[Burt Reinhardt , the executive vice president of CNN at its launch, hired most of the channel's first 200 employees, including the network's first [[News presenter|news anchor , [[Bernard Shaw  journalist |Bernard Shaw .<ref name=wp></ref>  Since its debut, CNN has expanded its reach to a number of cable and satellite television providers, several websites, and specialized closed-circuit channels  such as [[CNN Airport  . The company has 42 bureaus  11 domestic, 31 international , more than 900 affiliated local stations  which also receive news and features content via the video newswire service [[CNN Newsource  , and several regional and foreign-language networks around the world. The channel's success made a bona-fide mogul of founder Ted Turner and set the stage for conglomerate Time Warner's eventual acquisition of the [[Turner Broadcasting System  in 1996.  A companion channel, [[HLN  TV network |CNN2 , was launched on January 1, 1982 and featured a continuous 24-hour cycle of 30-minute news broadcasts. The channel, which later became known as CNN Headline News and is now known as simply HLN, eventually focused on live news coverage supplemented by personality-based programs during the evening and primetime hours.  ===Major events=== [[File:CNN Center newsroom1.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of the newsroom at CNN Center.   ====Gulf War==== The first Persian [[Gulf War  in 1991 was a watershed event for CNN that catapulted the channel past the ""[[Big Three television networks|Big Three "" American networks for the first time in its history, largely due to an unprecedented, historical scoop: CNN was the only news outlet with the ability to communicate from inside [[Iraq  during the initial hours of the Coalition bombing campaign, with live reports from the [[al-Rashid Hotel  in [[Baghdad  by reporters Bernard Shaw, [[John Holliman  and [[Peter Arnett .  [[File:CNN Gulf War nightscope January 1991.jpg|thumb|right|[[Operation Desert Storm  as captured live on a CNN [[night vision  camera with reporters narrating.  The moment when bombing began was announced on CNN by Shaw on January 16, 1991, as follows:  Unable to immediately broadcast live pictures from Baghdad, CNN's coverage of the initial hours of the Gulf War had the dramatic feel of a radio broadcast – and was compared to legendary [[CBS  news anchor [[Edward R. Murrow 's gripping live radio reports of the German bombing of London during [[World War II . Despite the lack of live pictures, CNN's coverage was carried by television stations and networks around the world, resulting in CNN being watched by over a billion viewers worldwide.  The Gulf War experience brought CNN some much sought-after legitimacy and made household names of previously obscure reporters. In 2000, media scholar and director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at [[Syracuse University , [[Robert Thompson  media scholar |Robert Thompson , stated that having turned 20, CNN was now the ""old guard."" Shaw, known for his live-from-Bagdhad reporting during the Gulf War, became CNN's chief anchor until his retirement in 2001. Others include then-[[The Pentagon|Pentagon  correspondent [[Wolf Blitzer   now host of ''[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer|The Situation Room ''  and international correspondent [[Christiane Amanpour . Amanpour's presence in Iraq was caricatured by actress [[Nora Dunn  as ruthless reporter Adriana Cruz in the 1999 film ''[[Three Kings  1999 film |Three Kings ''. Time Warner-owned sister network [[HBO  later produced a [[television movie , ''[[Live from Baghdad  film |Live from Baghdad '', about CNN's coverage of the first Gulf War.  Coverage of the first Gulf War and other crises of the early 1990s  particularly the infamous [[Battle of Mogadishu  1993 |Battle of Mogadishu   led officials at the Pentagon to coin the term ""the [[CNN effect "" to describe the perceived impact of [[Real-time computing|real time , 24-hour news coverage on the decision-making processes of the [[Federal government of the United States|American government .  ====September 11 attacks==== CNN was the first cable news channel to break the news of the [[September 11 attacks . [[News presenter|Anchor  [[Carol Lin  was on the air to deliver the first public report of the event. She broke into a commercial at 8:49&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time that morning and said:  Sean Murtagh, CNN vice president of finance and administration, was the first network employee on the air. He called into CNN Center from his office at CNN's New York City bureau and reported that a commercial jet had hit the Trade Center.  [[Daryn Kagan  and [[Leon Harris  were live on the air just after 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time as the second plane hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center and through an interview with CNN correspondent [[David Ensor  journalist |David Ensor , reported the news that U.S. officials determined ""that this is a terrorist act."" Later, [[Aaron Brown  journalist |Aaron Brown  and [[Judy Woodruff  anchored through the day and night as the attacks unfolded, winning an [[Edward R. Murrow Award  Radio Television Digital News Association |Edward R. Murrow award  for the network. Brown had just joined CNN from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC  to serve as the breaking news anchor. CNN has made archival files of much of the day's broadcast available in [http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2011/09/07/natpkg-911-aircheck-timeline.cnn?iref=allsearch five segments, plus an overview].  ====2008 U.S. election==== [[File:CNN-YouTube Republican Debate.jpg|thumb|right|The stage for the second 2008 [[CNN/YouTube presidential debates|CNN/YouTube presidential debate .  Leading up to the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election , CNN devoted large amounts of its coverage to politics, including hosting candidate debates during the [[Democratic Party  United States |Democratic  and [[Republican Party  United States |Republican  primary seasons. On June 3 and 5, CNN teamed up with [[Saint Anselm College  to sponsor the [[New Hampshire  Republican and Democratic Debates. Later in 2007, the channel hosted the first [[CNN/YouTube presidential debates , a non-traditional format where viewers were invited to pre-submit questions over the internet via the [[YouTube  video-sharing service. In 2008, CNN partnered with the ''[[Los Angeles Times '' to host two primary debates leading up to its coverage of [[Super Tuesday .<ref name=supertuesday></ref> CNN's debate and election night coverage led to its highest ratings of the year, with January 2008 viewership averaging 1.1 million viewers, a 41% increase over the previous year.<ref name=supertuesday/>  ====2016 U.S. election==== Driven by live coverage of the year's [[United States presidential election, 2016|US presidential election , 2016 was CNN's most-watched year in its history. Throughout the campaign, the network aired unedited coverage of many of the [[Trump rallies|Trump campaign rallies . Aides for Republican candidates [[Marco Rubio , [[Jeb Bush , and [[Ted Cruz  accused CNN President Jeff Zucker of undermining their candidates during the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|Republican primaries . After the election, Zucker acknowledged that it was a mistake to air so many of the campaign rallies. CNN also drew criticism during the election for hiring former Trump campaign manager [[Corey Lewandowski , who was still being paid by and was effectively working on behalf of the campaign.  ===Trump presidency, AT&T subsidiary=== The [[presidency of Donald Trump  has led to many prominent controversies involving CNN. The network was accused by critics of giving disproportionate amounts of coverage to Donald Trump and [[Democratic Party  United States |Democratic  candidate [[Hillary Clinton . CNN president [[Jeff Zucker  defended CNN against the criticism, commenting that out of the Republican candidates, Trump was the most willing to give on-air interviews. Trump commented upon the allegations during his speech at the 2017 [[Conservative Political Action Conference   CPAC , jokingly referring to CNN as the ""Clinton News Network"".<ref name=CNNLightningRod></ref>  In January 2017, CNN reported that Trump had been briefed on a [[Donald Trump–Russia dossier|classified dossier  which detailed compromising personal and financial information allegedly obtained by the Russian government. While CNN did not publish the dossier, Trump criticized the network during a press conference the following day, and refused to take a question from CNN reporter [[Jim Acosta , claiming that the network was ""[[fake news "". On June 26, 2017, CNN investigative journalists Thomas Frank, Eric Lichtblau, and Lex Haris voluntarily resigned after the network retracted an online article which incorrectly connected Trump aide [[Anthony Scaramucci  to a $10 billion Russian investment fund. The network apologized to Scaramucci and admitted that the online story did not meet their [[Journalism ethics and standards|editorial standards . Zucker responded by stressing that the network needs to ""play error-free ball"" when it comes to any future stories about Trump.  In July 2017, Trump posted a video on Twitter of himself tackling [[Vince McMahon  on the ground during [[WrestleMania 23 , edited to replace McMahon's face with the CNN logo. The clip was considered to be a further expression of his opinions regarding the network's quality of coverage. Several media columnists and Democratic politicians condemned the retweeted video, concerned that its substance—given the tone of some of Trump's criticism of mainstream media outlets for what he deems as unfavorable coverage of him and his presidency—could encourage some of his extreme right-wing supporters to commit violence against journalists from outlets outside of the conservative media spectrum.<ref name=""kfile""></ref><ref name=""nyt-fraudnews""></ref> Later that month, a group of Democratic United States Senators, led by [[Amy Klobuchar , issued a request for information over allegations that the Trump administration was planning to use CNN as ""leverage for political gain"" in the process of clearing the proposed acquisition of its parent company Time Warner by [[AT&T —a purchase which was first announced in October 2016. ''[[The Daily Caller '' reported that, in particular, the administration was seeking the removal of Jeff Zucker as CNN president. Although Trump had promised to block the acquisition entirely during his presidential campaign, Trump's transition team later stated that the government planned to evaluate the deal without prejudice.  Following the announcement of the acquisition, AT&T CEO [[Randall L. Stephenson  stated that the company was ""committed to continuing the editorial independence of CNN"".<ref name=""deadline-maybesell"" /> In August 2017, ''[[Deadline Hollywood '' reported that AT&T had considered spinning off CNN and its stake in [[TMZ  post-acquisition.<ref name=""deadline-maybesell""></ref> In October 2017, Stephenson downplayed the possibility that the ongoing tensions between Trump and CNN could affect the deal, stating that he ""[didn't] know what the relevance of CNN is in terms of an antitrust review"", and that AT&T did not plan to make managerial changes to Time Warner properties that were operating well, such as CNN. Later that month, CNN launched a new promotional campaign, ""Facts First"", in an effort to combat negative perceptions over the quality of its reporting. Using an [[apple  to demonstrate metaphors for fake news and ""[[alternative facts ""  in particular, suggesting that one could persistently opine that the apple was actually a [[banana  , the ads publicize a commitment to prioritizing accurate, fact-based reporting before presenting opinions on a particular story. The ad became the subject of parodies, including one by ''The Daily Caller''  which reversed the ad, and amended the slogan with ""unless we are reporting on Trump"" , and [[Stephen Colbert   which closed with the line ""Now orange you ready to impeach?"" , and was criticized by conservative publishers, Republican politicians, and on social media.  On November 6, 2017, Stephenson met with [[Makan Delrahim , assistant Attorney General of the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division , to discuss [[antitrust  and [[concentration of media ownership  concerns surrounding the acquisition, and possible options for satisfying them.<ref name=""cnn-gotocourt"" /><ref name=""cnbc-deniedatt""></ref> Two days later, major media outlets publicly reported that the Justice Department had recommended that either the entire Turner Broadcasting System unit, or [[DirecTV , be divested as a condition of the merger. The ''[[Financial Times '' went further, stating that it had specifically demanded the divestment of CNN.<ref name=""cnn-gotocourt"" /> Stephenson denied these reports, stating that he never offered to, nor had any intentions to sell CNN. CNN's media analyst [[Brian Stelter  noted that media outlets were interpreting the alleged recommendations as being either a genuine concern for AT&T's scale following the merger, or a retaliatory measure by the Trump administration against CNN.<ref name=""cnn-gotocourt"" />  At the ''[[DealBook '' conference in New York City the next day, Stephenson denied that the Department had demanded the divestment of CNN at all  stating that he had ""never been told that the price of getting the deal done was selling CNN"" , and that the company aimed to ""get to a negotiated settlement"". However, he stated that if they were unable to do so, AT&T was ""prepared to litigate"".<ref name=""cnn-gotocourt""></ref> In a statement to [[CNBC , a Department of Justice official backed Stephenson, denying that there were any specific demands to divest CNN during the discussion, and considering the claims to be ""shocking"" and an attempt to politicize the situation. The official added that the Department had officially recommended either abandoning the deal entirely, or divesting DirecTV or Turner, but that it was open to other options for quelling antitrust concerns.<ref name=""cnbc-deniedatt"" /> The same day, the watchdog group Protect Democracy sued the Department of Justice to seek information on whether the Trump administration had ""improperly interfered with the Department's review of the merger between AT&T and Time Warner, or has acted in that matter based on the President's personal dislike of CNN's [[protected speech ."" The group had issued a [[Freedom of Information Act  request for these details, but the Department had not responded. On November 20, 2017, the Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit over the acquisition.   The proposed merger was affirmed on June 12, 2018, after [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|District of Columbia U.S. District Court  Judge [[Richard J. Leon  ruled in favor of AT&T in the lawsuit. The merger closed two days later, with the company becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T under the renamed parent company [[WarnerMedia . Under a proposed reorganization announced in March 2019  which will involve the dissolution of Turner Broadcasting , AT&T stated that CNN would be moved into a new ""WarnerMedia News & Sports"" division led by Jeff Zucker, adding [[Turner Sports  and the [[AT&T SportsNet  [[regional sports network s to his oversight.<ref name=""cnbc""></ref>  ==Programming==  CNN's current weekday schedule consists mostly of rolling news programming during daytime hours, followed by in-depth news and information programs during the evening and primetime hours. The network's morning programming consists of ''[[Early Start '', an early-morning news program hosted by [[Christine Romans  and [[Dave Briggs  journalist |Dave Briggs  at 4–6 a.m. ET, which is followed by ''[[New Day  TV program |New Day '', the network's [[breakfast television|morning show , hosted by [[Alisyn Camerota  and [[John Berman  at 6–9 a.m. ET. Most of CNN's late-morning and early afternoon programming consists of ''[[CNN Newsroom '', a rolling news program hosted by [[Jim Sciutto  and [[Poppy Harlow  in the morning and [[Brooke Baldwin  in the afternoon. In between the editions of ''Newsroom'', ''[[At This Hour with Kate Bolduan|At This Hour '' with [[Kate Bolduan  airs at 11 a.m. to noon Eastern, followed by ''[[Inside Politics|Inside Politics with John King '', hosted by [[John King  journalist |John King  at noon Eastern, and ''CNN Right Now'' with [[Brianna Keilar  at 1 p.m. Eastern.<ref name=""tvnewser-sugarhigh""></ref>  CNN's late afternoon and early evening lineup consists of ''[[The Lead with Jake Tapper '', hosted by [[Jake Tapper  at 4 p.m. Eastern and ''[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer '', hosted by [[Wolf Blitzer  at 5–7 p.m. ET. The network's evening and primetime lineup shifts towards more in-depth programming, including ''[[Erin Burnett OutFront '' at 7 p.m. ET, and ''[[Anderson Cooper 360° '' at 8 p.m. ET, followed by ''[[Cuomo Prime Time '' with [[Chris Cuomo  at 9 p.m., and ''[[CNN Tonight '' hosted by [[Don Lemon  at 10 p.m. Eastern. Overnight programming consists of reruns of the primetime lineup, and an overnight simulcast of the [[CNN International  version of ''[[CNN Newsroom  CNNI |CNN Newsroom '' from [[Atlanta, GA .  Weekend primetime is dedicated mostly to factual programming, such as documentary-style [[reality television|reality  series  including ''[[Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown '' and ''[[United Shades of America '' , along with original based documentaries and specials  including those presented under blanket titles such as ''[[CNN Presents '' and ''[[CNN Special Investigations Unit '' , as well as acquired documentary films presented under the banner ''[[CNN Films ''. The network's weekend morning programming consists of ''CNN Newsroom''  simulcast from CNN International  at 4–6 a.m. ET, which is followed by the weekend editions of ''New Day'', hosted by [[Christi Paul  and [[Victor Blackwell , which airs every Saturday at 6–9 a.m. ET and Sunday at 6–8 a.m. ET and the network's Saturday program ''Smerconish'' with [[Michael Smerconish  at 9 a.m. Eastern and replay at 6 p.m. Eastern. Sunday morning lineup consists primarily of [[Sunday morning talk shows|political talk shows , including ''[[Inside Politics|Inside Politics with John King '', hosted by [[John King  journalist |John King  at 8 a.m. Eastern and ''[[State of the Union  TV series |State of the Union '', hosted by [[Jake Tapper  at 9 a.m. Eastern and replay at noon Eastern, and the international affairs program ''[[Fareed Zakaria GPS '', hosted by [[Fareed Zakaria  at 10 a.m. Eastern and replay at 1 p.m. Eastern, and the media analysis program ''[[Reliable Sources '', hosted by [[Brian Stelter  at 11 a.m. Eastern.  For the 2014–15 season, after cancelling ''[[Piers Morgan Tonight ''  which, itself, replaced the long-running ''[[Larry King Live '' , CNN experimented with running factual and reality-style programming during the 9:00&nbsp;p.m. ET hour,  such as [[John Walsh  television host |John Walsh 's ''[[The Hunt with John Walsh|The Hunt '', ''[[This Is Life with Lisa Ling '', and [[Mike Rowe 's ''[[Somebody's Gotta Do It ''. Jeff Zucker explained that this new lineup was intended to shift CNN away from a reliance on [[pundit -oriented programs, and attract younger demographics to the network. Zucker stated that the 9:00&nbsp;p.m. hour could be pre-empted during major news events for expanded coverage. These changes coincided with the introduction of a new imaging campaign for the network, featuring the slogan ""Go there"".<ref name=""variety-newprime""></ref><ref name=""lat-newlineup""></ref><ref name=""tvn-cnnnewlineup""></ref> In May 2014, CNN premiered ''[[The Sixties  miniseries |The Sixties '', a documentary miniseries produced by [[Tom Hanks  and [[Gary Goetzman  which chronicled the United States in the 1960s. Owing to its success, CNN commissioned follow-ups focusing on other decades.<ref name=""variety-seventies""></ref><ref name=""variety-eighties""></ref> ''Anderson Cooper 360°'' has since been expanded back into a two-hour format to occupy the 8-9 p.m. timeslot.  ===On-air presentation=== CNN began broadcasting in the [[high definition television|high definition  [[1080i  resolution format in September 2007.<ref name=hdlaunch></ref> This format is now standard for CNN and is available on all major cable and satellite providers. [[File:CNN Election Express.jpg|thumb|right|The CNN Election Express bus, used for broadcasts.  CNN's political coverage in HD was first given mobility by the introduction of the CNN Election Express bus in October 2007. The Election Express vehicle, capable of five simultaneous HD feeds, was used for the channel's CNN-YouTube presidential debates and for presidential candidate interviews.  In December 2008, CNN introduced a comprehensive redesign of its on-air appearance, which replaced an existing style that had been used since 2004. On-air graphics took a rounded, flat look in a predominantly black, white, and red color scheme, and the introduction of a new box next to the CNN logo for displaying show logos and segment-specific graphics, rather than as a large banner above the lower-third. The redesign also replaced the scrolling ticker with a static ""flipper"", which could either display a feed of news headlines  both manually inserted and taken from the [[RSS  feeds of CNN.com , or ""topical"" details related to a story.<ref name=CNNnewlook></ref><ref name=""tvn-2011look""></ref>  CNN's next major redesign was introduced on January 10, 2011, replacing the dark, flat appearance of the 2008 look with a glossier, blue and white color scheme, and moving the secondary logo box to the opposite end of the screen. Additionally, the network began to solely produce its programming in the [[16:9  aspect ratio, with standard definition feeds using a [[letterboxing  filming |letterboxed  version of the HD feed.<ref name=""tvn-2011look""/> On February 18, 2013, the ""flipper"" was dropped and reverted to a scrolling ticker; originally displayed as a blue background with white text, the ticker was reconfigured a day later with blue text on a white background to match the look of the 'flipper'.  On August 11, 2014, CNN introduced its most recent graphics package, dropping the glossy appearance for a flat, rectangular scheme incorporating red, white, and black colors, and the [[Gotham  typeface |Gotham  typeface. The ticker now alternates between general headlines and financial news from [[CNNMoney , and the secondary logo box was replaced with a smaller box below the CNN bug, which displays either the title, [[hashtag , or [[Twitter  handle for the show being aired or its anchor.<ref name=""tvn-2014graphics""></ref> In April 2016, CNN began to introduce a new corporate typeface, known as ""CNN Sans"", across all of its platforms. Inspired by [[Helvetica Neue  and commissioned after consultations with Troika Design Group, the font family consists of 30 different versions with varying weights and widths to facilitate use across print, television, and digital mediums.<ref name=""promaxbda-newfont""></ref>  In August 2016, CNN announced the launch of its new initiative, CNN Aerial Imagery and Reporting  CNN AIR . It is a drone-based news collecting operation to integrate aerial imagery and reporting across all CNN branches and platforms, along with Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner entities.  ==Staff==  On July 27, 2012, CNN president [[Jim Walton  journalist |Jim Walton  announced he was resigning after 30 years at the network. Walton remained with CNN until the end of that year. In January 2013, former [[NBCUniversal  President Jeff Zucker replaced Walton.  On January 29, 2013, longtime political analysts [[James Carville  and [[Mary Matalin , and fellow political contributor [[Erick Erickson  were let go by CNN.  ==Other platforms== ===Online=== [[File:CNN Website April 2011.png|thumb|International version in April 2011  CNN launched its website, CNN.com  initially known as ''CNN Interactive'' , on August 30, 1995. The site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most popular news websites in the world. The widespread growth of blogs, [[social media  and [[user-generated content  have influenced the site, and blogs in particular have focused CNN's previously scattershot online offerings, most noticeably in the development and launch of [[CNN Pipeline  in late 2005.  In April 2009, CNN.com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the U.S., according to Nielsen/NetRatings; with an increase of 11% over the previous year.  [[CNN Pipeline  was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources  or ""pipes"" , on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up ""news alerts"" to computer users. The installable client was available to users of [[personal computer|PCs  running [[Microsoft Windows . There was also a browser-based ""web client"" that did not require installation. The service was discontinued in July 2007, and was replaced with a free streaming service.  The topical news program ''[[Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics '' was the first CNN program to feature a round-up of blogs in 2005. Blog coverage was expanded when ''[[Inside Politics '' was folded into ''The Situation Room''  ''Inside Politics'' later returned to CNN in 2014, this time hosted by the network's chief national correspondent John King. . In 2006, CNN launched CNN Exchange and [[CNN iReport , initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from [[blogging  to [[citizen journalism  within the CNN brand. CNN iReport which features user-submitted photos and video, has achieved considerable traction, with increasingly professional-looking reports filed by amateur journalists, many still in high school or college. The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the [[Virginia Tech shootings  sent-in first hand photos of what was going on during the shootings.  In early 2008, CNN began maintaining a live streaming broadcast available to cable and satellite subscribers who receive CNN at home  a precursor to the [[TV Everywhere  services that would become popularized by cable and satellite providers beginning with Time Warner's incorporation of the medium .<ref name=""CNNlivestreaming""></ref> CNN International is broadcast live, as part of the [[RealNetworks  SuperPass subscription service outside the U.S. CNN also offers several [[RSS|RSS feeds  and [[podcast s.  On April 18, 2008, CNN.com was targeted by Chinese hackers in retaliation for the channel's coverage on the [[2008 Tibetan unrest . CNN reported that they took preventative measures after news broke of the impending attack.  The company was honored at the 2008 [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award s for development and implementation of an integrated and portable IP-based live, edit and store-and-forward digital news gathering  DNG  system. The first use of what would later win CNN this award was in April 2001 when CNN correspondent Lisa Rose Weaver covered, and was detained, for the release of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy  crew of a damaged electronic surveillance plane after the [[Hainan Island incident . The technology consisted of a videophone produced by 7E Communications Ltd of London, UK. This DNG workflow is used today by the network to receive material worldwide using an [[Apple Inc.|Apple  [[MacBook Pro , various [[prosumer  and professional digital cameras, software from Streambox Inc., and [[BGAN  terminals from [[Hughes Network Systems .  On October 24, 2009, CNN launched a new version of the CNN.com website; the revamped site included the addition of a new ""sign up"" option, in which users can create their own username and profile, and a new ""CNN Pulse""  beta  feature, along with a new red color theme. However, most of the news stories archived on the website were deleted. , there are four versions of the website: the [https://web.archive.org/web/20170727041509/http://us.cnn.com/ American version], the [http://www.edition.cnn.com International version], the [http://www.cnnespanol.cnn.com Spanish version], and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20170727041524/https://arabic.cnn.com/ Arabic version]. Readers can choose their preferred version, but, in the absence of a selection, the server determines an edition according to the requesting IP address.  CNN also has a channel in the popular video-sharing site [[YouTube , but its videos can only be viewed in the United States, a source of criticism among YouTube users worldwide. In 2014, CNN launched a radio version of their popular Television programming on [[TuneIn  Radio.  In April 2010, CNN announced via Twitter that it would launch a food blog called ""Eatocracy,"" which will ""cover all news related to food – from recalls to health issues to culture."" CNN had an [[internet relay chat   IRC  network at chat.cnn.com. CNN placed a live chat with [[Benjamin Netanyahu  on the network in 1998.

After all, it's all part of the business."" However, in April 2008, Turner criticized the direction that CNN has taken.  In October 2016, [[WikiLeaks  published [[Podesta emails|emails  from [[John Podesta  which showed CNN contributor [[Donna Brazile  passing the questions for a CNN-sponsored debate to the Clinton campaign. In the email, Brazile discussed her concern of Clinton's ability to field a question regarding the death penalty. The following day Clinton would receive the question about the death penalty, verbatim from an audience member at the CNN-hosted Town Hall event.<ref name= CNNWikiLeaksTownHall></ref> According to a [[CNNMoney  investigation, the debate moderator [[Roland Martin  journalist |Roland Martin  of [[TV One  U.S. TV network |TV One  ""did not deny sharing information with Brazile.""<ref name=""CNNWikiLeaksTownHall""/> CNN severed ties with Brazile three days later, on October 14, 2016.  ==Awards and honors==  2018: CNN won a network-record six news & documentary [[Emmy Award s.

A morning newspaper serving most of the state north of [[New Haven  and east of [[Waterbury , its headquarters on Broad Street are a short walk from the [[Connecticut State Capitol|state capitol . It reports regional news with a chain of bureaus in smaller cities and a series of local editions. It also operates [[CTNow , a free local weekly newspaper and website.   Beginning in 2000, it was owned by [[Tribune Media|Tribune Company , which later combined the paper's management and facilities with those of Tribune-owned [[WTIC-TV  in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford .  In 2014, the newspapers were spun off to corporate parent [[Tribune Publishing .  ==History== [[Image:PostcardHartfordCourant1898to1901.jpg|thumb|left|Courant building on State Street  about 1900    The ''Connecticut Courant'' began as a weekly on October 29, 1764, started by Thomas Green. The word ""courant"", borrowed from the French  possibly by way of Dutch ''krant'' ,  was a popular name for English-language newspapers. The daily ''Hartford Courant'' traces its existence back to the weekly, thereby claiming the title ""America's oldest continuously published newspaper"", and adopting as its slogan, ""Older than the nation.""  ''[[The New Hampshire Gazette '', which started publication in 1756 and all but disappeared into other publications for most of a century, trademarked the title of oldest paper in the nation after being revived as a small biweekly in 1989. See also the ''[[New York Post '' as oldest daily, ''[[Providence Journal '' as oldest continuous daily, and ''Time'' magazine's view of ""oldest"" claims.   [[Joseph Roswell Hawley , a leading Republican politician and former governor of the state, in 1867 bought the newspaper, which he combined with the ''Press.'' Under his editorship, this became the most influential newspaper in Connecticut and one of the leading Republican papers in the country.  [[Emile Gauvreau  became a reporter in 1916, and the managing editor in 1919. His energetic and often sensational news policies affronted Charles Clark, the owner and editor. Clark fired him when he refused to stop a series of stories about the exploitation of fake medical diplomas. Gauvreau went on to be a major figure in the [[New York City  [[Tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid  wars of the [[Roaring Twenties  as the first managing editor of the [[New York Evening Graphic  and later m.e. of the [[New York Mirror .    [[Herbert Brucker  was the most prominent editor in the 20th century.  ===Recent history===  The ''Courant'' was purchased in 1979 by [[Times Mirror Company|Times Mirror , the ''[[Los Angeles Times '' parent company. The first years of out-of-town ownership are described by a former ''Courant'' reporter in a book titled ''Spiked: How Chain Management Corrupted America's Oldest Newspaper.'' <ref name=2007data></ref> One criticism was that the new owners were more interested in awards, and less interested in traditional ''Courant'' devotion to exhaustive coverage of  local news.  The ''Courant'' won a 1992 [[Pulitzer Prize  for inquiring into problems with the [[Hubble Space Telescope   a Connecticut company was involved in the construction , and it won a 1999 Pulitzer Prize in the Breaking News category for coverage of a 1998 [[Connecticut Lottery killings|murder-suicide  that took five lives at [[Connecticut Lottery  headquarters. A series of articles about sexual abuse by the head of a worldwide Catholic order, published since February 1997, constituted the first denunciation of [[Marciel Maciel  known to a wider audience.  [[File:The Hartford Courant building in downtown Hartford, seen from I-84 East.jpg|thumb|The current building of the Hartford Courant Co.  In 2000, Times Mirror and the ''Courant'' became part of the [[Tribune Company , one of the world's largest multimedia companies. Ironically, along the way, the ''Courant'' also acquired the [[Valley Advocate  group of ""alternative"" weeklies started by two disgruntled ''Courant'' staff members in 1973.  Under new ownership, it is co-owned with two local television stations:  [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox  affiliate [[WTIC-TV  and [[The CW  affiliate [[WCCT-TV .  The ''Courant'' is the most recent American newspaper to win the [[Society for News Design 's World's Best Designed Newspaper award  awarded in 2005 .  In 2006, the paper's investigation into mental health and suicides among Americans serving in the Iraq war was featured in the PBS documentary series ''[[Exposé: America's Investigative Reports '' in an episode entitled ""Question 7"".  In late June 2006, the Tribune Co. announced that ''Courant'' publisher Jack W. Davis Jr. would by replaced by Stephen D. Carver, vice president and general manager of Atlanta, Ga., TV station WATL. In March 2009, Tribune replaced Carver with Richard Graziano, who was given a dual role as Courant publisher and general manager of Tribune's two Hartford television stations. In May of the same year, Tribune announced that Jeff Levine, a newspaper executive with a background in marketing, would become ""director of content"" and that the editor or ""print platform manager"" of the ''Courant'' would report to Levine as would the news director of WTIC-TV. Shortly after that, the ''Courant's'' two highest ranking editors were let go.  After 2010, ''Courant'' has offered early retirement and buyout packages to reduce staff as it continues to experience declines in advertising revenue. There have also been layoffs and reduction in pages.  Newsroom staff peaked in 1994 at close to 400 staff, down to 175 staff by 2008, and 135 staff in 2009.  On Nov. 18, 2013 Tribune Company announced the appointment of Nancy Meyer as Publisher, succeeding Rich Graziano who left to become President/General Manager of WPIX-TV  PIX11  in New York City.  In 2014, the ''Courant'' purchased the ''[[ReminderNews '' chain of weekly newspapers.  On October 10, 2014 Tribune Company announced the appointment of Rick Daniels as publisher of the Hartford Courant, succeeding Nancy Meyer who was promoted to Publisher and CEO of the Orlando Sentinel.  Andrew Julien was named the combined publisher and editor in March 2016.  In 2018, the Hartford Courant joined more than 300 newspapers in releasing editorials in response to President's Trump's anti-media rhetoric, a show of solidarity initiated by [[The Boston Globe .

Lisa Chedekel and Matthew Kauffman of the Hartford Courant were 2007 Pulitzer Prize Finalists in Investigative Reporting for their in-depth reporting on suicide rates among American soldiers in Iraq which led to congressional and military action addressing the issues raised in the series.   The Hartford Courant Staff was a 2013 Pulitzer Prize Finalist for its comprehensive and compassionate coverage of the 2012 shooting massacre at [[Sandy Hook Elementary School .   ==Politics== The ''Courant'' weighed in on the contentious and antagonistic 2016 Presidential Election, endorsing [[Hillary Clinton  over controversial contender [[Donald Trump .

In August 2018 the ''Courant'' endorsed [[Ned Lamont  in the Democratic primary as the only ""credible"" choice compared to rival [[Joe Ganim . The ''Courant'' went on to endorse independent candidate [[Oz Griebel  in the general election.  ==Controversies==  ===Sleepy's=== In August 2009, the ''Courant'' attracted some controversy over its firing of George Gombossy, a 40-year veteran of the paper and its consumer advocate at the time. Gombossy charged that the ''Courant'' had [[Spike  journalism |spiked  an article he had written about an ongoing investigation by the [[Connecticut Attorney General|Connecticut attorney general  accusing [[Sleepy's   a major advertiser in the paper  of selling used and bedbug-infested mattresses as new.  Gombossy's lawsuit against the ''Courant'' was thrown out by a [[Connecticut Superior Court  judge in July 2010.  In his decision, Judge Marshall K. Berger, Jr. remarked that newspaper owners and editors have a ""paramount"" right to ""control [the] content of their papers,"" further observing that in his role at the ''Courant'', Gombossy had ""no constitutional right to publish anything.""  However, Gombossy's attorneys filed a second complaint, and Judge Berger reinstated the complaint.  The case headed to trial in the fall of 2011.  ===Plagiarism=== In September 2009 the ''Courant's'' publisher, Richard Graziano, publicly apologized as the newspaper accepted a plagiarism charge.  Competitors had accused the ''Courant'' of taking its content without permission and refusing to give proper credit.  == Community ==  === Camp Courant === For over 123 years Camp Courant has been a centerpiece in the Hartford community and a welcomed signifier of summer for the city's youth. The camp was founded in 1894 by a group of Hartford Courant  employees who wanted to make a difference and today the camp now now serves over 1,000 of Hartford's children, ages five to 12, generally between 500 - 600 children per day for six weeks each summer. Camp Courant is the largest free summer day camp in the country and is the only summer camp servicing Hartford's inner-city youth. The program provides transportation, preventive and acute health and social work services, two meals a day, and recreational, educational and developmental activities, all at no cost to the camper or their family. The camp totes programming that helps campers develop into healthy, responsible adults.

It is named after [[Austrian School  economist [[Ludwig von Mises   1881–1973  because it promotes teaching and research in the Austrian School of economics and misesian views on social and political philosophy.  The Mises Institute was founded in 1982 by [[Lew Rockwell , [[Burton Blumert , and [[Murray Rothbard , following a split between the [[Cato Institute  and Rothbard, who had been one of the founders of the Cato Institute. Additional backing for the founding of the Institute came from Mises's wife, Margit von Mises, [[Henry Hazlitt , [[Lawrence Fertig , and Nobel Economics Laureate [[Friedrich Hayek . Through its publications, the Institute promotes [[right-libertarianism|libertarian , [[paleolibertarianism|paleolibertarian  and [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist  political theories and a form of [[heterodox economics  known as [[praxeology   ""the logic of action"" .  ==Background and location== [[File:Blumert Rockwell Gordon Rothbard.jpg|left|thumb|[[Burton Blumert , [[Llewellyn Rockwell , [[David Gordon  philosopher |David Gordon , and [[Murray Rothbard   :''Further information: [[Austrian economics#Split among contemporary Austrians|Split among the contemporary Austrian School '' The Ludwig von Mises Institute was established in 1982 in the wake of a dispute which occurred in the early 1980s between [[Murray Rothbard  and the [[Cato Institute , another libertarian organization co-founded by Rothbard. Llewellyn Rockwell has stated that the Mises Institute met strong opposition from parties affiliated with the [[Koch family , Rothbard's former backers at Cato.<ref name=kochtopus></ref> Rothbard was the Mises Institute's vice president and head of academic programs until his death in 1995.  The Institute states that its founding ambition is to be ""the research and educational center of classical liberalism, libertarian political theory, and the Austrian School of economics"". It has reprinted works by Mises, Rothbard, Hayek, and others. It presents the annual ""Austrian Economics Research Conference""  AERC  and ""Mises University"", at which Austrian School thinkers meet, and Institute personnel teach and advise students, respectively. The Institute reports that its library holds nearly 35,000 volumes, including Rothbard's personal library.  [[File:Mises Institute Campus 1.jpg|left|thumb|The Institute building, the Mises Campus Early after its founding, the Mises Institute was located at the business department offices of [[Auburn University , and relocated nearby to its current site in 1998.  According to a story in the ''[[Wall Street Journal '', the Institute chose its Auburn location for low cost of living and ""good ol' Southern hospitality"". The article goes on ""to make an additional point"", that ""Southerners have always been distrustful of government,"" making the South a natural home for the organization's libertarian outlook. The institute has a staff of 16 Senior Fellows and about 70 adjunct scholars from the United States and other countries.  ==Views espoused by founders and organization scholars== In a 2006 article published on the ''Wall Street Journal's'' website, Kyle Wingfield credited the Institute for helping make the ""Heart of Dixie a wellspring of sensible economic thinking."" Wingfield pointed to the Institute's publication and promotion of the work of Mises and other Austrian economists, who he characterizes as advocating ""limited government, lower taxes, stronger private property rights and less business regulation.""  ===Forms of government=== The Institute has published works by authors critical of various forms of government, including democracy, which was called coercive,<ref name=""s383""></ref> incompatible with wealth creation,<ref name=""s1208""></ref> replete with inner contradictions,<ref name=""ch5or17""></ref> and a system of legalized graft.<ref name=""s665""></ref> To many of these authors, the distinction lies not in the form of government, but in the degree of liberty individuals in a society actually enjoy.<ref name=""s383"" /> Lew Rockwell notably said ""the best way to teach your kids about taxes is by eating thirty percent of their ice cream.""   ===American Civil War and the Confederacy=== A 2000 [[Southern Poverty Law Center  ""Intelligence Report"" categorized the Institute as [[Neo-Confederate , ""devoted to a radical libertarian view of government and economics.""  ==Criticisms== The Mises Institute has been criticized by some libertarians for the incorporation of [[paleolibertarian  and [[right-wing  cultural views, including the positions taken by some of its leading figures on topics such as race, immigration, and the presidential campaign of [[Donald Trump . Often these criticisms affirm that there are aspects of the paleolibertarian ideology that supposedly are at odds with the views of the historical Ludwig von Mises. In an article written on Institute Chairman Lew Rockwell's website, Jacob Huebert observes that socially liberal libertarians have often accused the Mises Institute of racism. He calls the charges erroneous and argues that they might stem from the support of some Institute scholars for immigration restrictions, its support of Confederate secession, or its uncompromising stand on libertarian issues and property rights.  In 2003, [[Chip Berlet  of the Southern Poverty Law Center  SPLC  described the Mises Institute as ""a major center promoting libertarian political theory and the Austrian School of free market economics"", also noting Rothbard's opposition to child labor laws and the anti-immigrant views of other Institute scholars. Heidi Beirich, also with the SPLC, describes the Institute as ""a hard-right libertarian foundation"".  ==Publications, conferences, activities and awards== [[Image:Qjaustrianeconomics.gif|thumb|upright|''Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics''  <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Gary North economist.jpg|left|thumb|2004 Rothbard medalist [[Gary North  economist |Gary North  delivers his acceptance speech  --> The Mises Institute makes available a large number of books, journal articles, and other writings online, and archives various writings on its website.

It began as a library founded in 1919 by Republican and Stanford alumnus [[Herbert Hoover , before he became [[President of the United States . The library, known as the [[Hoover Institution Library and Archives , houses multiple archives related to Hoover, World War I, World War II, and other world history. According to the ''2016 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report''  [[Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program , [[University of Pennsylvania  , Hoover is   of 90  in the ""Top Think Tanks in the United States"".<ref name=""Global Go To""> </ref>  The Hoover Institution is a unit of Stanford University but has its own board of overseers. It is located on the campus.  Its mission statement outlines its basic tenets: representative government, private enterprise, peace, personal freedom, and the safeguards of the American system.<ref name=""Hoover Institution Mission Statement""></ref> The institution is generally described as [[Fiscal conservatism|conservative , although directors and others associated with it assert that the institution is [[nonpartisan , as its primary goal is to ""promote economic opportunity and prosperity, while securing and safeguarding peace for America and all mankind.""  The institution has been a place of scholarship for individuals who previously held high-profile positions in government, such as [[George Shultz , [[Condoleezza Rice , [[Michael Boskin , [[Edward Lazear , [[John B. Taylor , [[Edwin Meese , and [[Amy Zegart —all Hoover Institution fellows. In 2007, retired U.S. Army [[John Abizaid|General John P. Abizaid , former commander of the [[CENTCOM|U.S. Central Command , was named the Institution's first annual Annenberg Distinguished Visiting Fellow.<ref name=Abizaid></ref> Former Secretary of Defense General [[James Mattis  served as a research fellow at Hoover before being appointed by the Trump administration.  The institution is housed in four buildings on the Stanford campus. The most prominent facility is the landmark [[Hoover Tower , which is a popular visitor attraction. The tower features an observation deck on the top level that provides visitors with a panoramic view of the Stanford campus and surrounding area. Additionally, the institution has a branch office in the Johnson Center in Washington, DC.  ==History== <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Herbert Hoover Hoover Tower.jpg|thumb|right|[[Herbert Hoover  in front of [[Hoover Tower  at [[Stanford University   --> The Institution was set up by [[Herbert Hoover , one of Stanford's first graduates, who would later become the 31st President of the United States. He had been in charge of American relief efforts in Europe after World War I. Hoover's express purpose was to collect the records of contemporary history as it was happening. Hoover's helpers frequently risked their lives to rescue documentary and rare printed material, especially from countries under Nazi or Communist rule. Their many successes included the papers of [[Rosa Luxemburg , the [[Goebbels Diaries , and the records of the Russian secret police in Paris. Research institutes were also set up under Hoover's influence, though inevitably there were to be clashes between the moving force, Hoover, and the host university.  In 1919, Hoover donated $50,000 to Stanford University to support the collection of primary materials related to World War I, a project that became known as the Hoover War Collection. Supported primarily by gifts from private donors, the Hoover War Collection flourished in its early years. In 1922, the Collection became known as the [[Hoover Institution Library and Archives|Hoover War Library . The Hoover War Library was housed in the [[Stanford Library , separate from the general stacks. By 1926, the Hoover War Library was known as the largest library in the world devoted to the Great War. By 1929, it contained 1.4 million items and was becoming too large to house in the Stanford Library. In 1938, the War Library revealed building plans for [[Hoover Tower , which was to be its permanent home independent of the Stanford Library system. The tower was completed in 1941, Stanford University's fiftieth anniversary.<ref name=""Library and Archives – Historical background""></ref>  By 1946, the agenda of the Hoover War Library had expanded to include research activities; thus the organization was renamed the Hoover Institution and Library on War, Revolution and Peace. At this time, Herbert Hoover was living in New York City but remained integrally involved in the Hoover Institution and Library as a benefactor, fundraiser, and consultant.  In 1956 former President Hoover, under the auspices of the Institution and Library, launched a major fundraising campaign that allowed the Institution to realize its current form as a think tank and archive. In 1957, the Hoover Institution and Library was renamed the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace—the name it holds today.<ref name=""About Herbert Hoover and the Hoover Institution""></ref>  In 1960, W. Glenn Campbell was appointed director and substantial budget increases soon led to corresponding increases in acquisitions and related research projects. In particular, the Chinese and Russian collections grew considerably. Despite student unrest in the 1960s, the institution continued to thrive and develop closer relations with Stanford.  [[John Raisian  served as director from 1989 to 2015. [[Thomas W. Gilligan  succeeded him in 2015.  ==Members== In May 2018 the website of the Hoover Institution listed 198 fellows.

It began as a library founded in 1919 by Republican and Stanford alumnus Herbert Hoover, before he became President of the United States. The library, known as the Hoover Institution Library and Archives, houses multiple archives related to Hoover, World War I, World War II, and other world history. According to the 2016 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report  Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, University of Pennsylvania , Hoover is No. 18  of 90  in the ""Top Think Tanks in the United States"".The Hoover Institution is a unit of Stanford University but has its own board of overseers. It is located on the campus.  Its mission statement outlines its basic tenets: representative government, private enterprise, peace, personal freedom, and the safeguards of the American system. The institution is generally described as conservative, although directors and others associated with it assert that the institution is nonpartisan, as its primary goal is to ""promote economic opportunity and prosperity, while securing and safeguarding peace for America and all mankind.""The institution has been a place of scholarship for individuals who previously held high-profile positions in government, such as George Shultz, Condoleezza Rice, Michael Boskin, Edward Lazear, John B. Taylor, Edwin Meese, and Amy Zegart—all Hoover Institution fellows. In 2007, retired U.S. Army General John P. Abizaid, former commander of the U.S. Central Command, was named the Institution's first annual Annenberg Distinguished Visiting Fellow. Former Secretary of Defense General James Mattis served as a research fellow at Hoover before being appointed by the Trump administration.The institution is housed in four buildings on the Stanford campus. The most prominent facility is the landmark Hoover Tower, which is a popular visitor attraction. The tower features an observation deck on the top level that provides visitors with a panoramic view of the Stanford campus and surrounding area. Additionally, the institution has a branch office in the Johnson Center in Washington, DC."

According to [[Neal Gabler  of the [[Columbia Journalism Review , ""among the many stories [Baker] has covered are ''[[New york Times|New York Times '' reporter [[Judith Miller ’s misleading scoops about [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , the West’s indifference to capturing accused Serbian war criminal Radovan Karadzic, the practices of Scientology, and George W. Bush’s National Guard record, which he expanded upon in his magnum opus, ''[[Family of Secrets ,'' a heavily-annotated deep dive into what he argues are the decades-long transgressions of the Bushes.""  In March 2010, he appeared before the ""Treason in America Conference,"" a gathering of [[9/11 Truth movement|Sept. 11 truthers.  Baker said the [[9/11 Commission|9/11 commission  had “no credibility,” and ""sounded open to the possibility that 9/11 was an inside job.""<ref name=""Boston - 1-15"" /> In 2014, he addressed a conference of the Assassination Archives and Research Center on the ""role of the [[Warren Commission  on the cover-up.""<ref name=""Baker video 2014""></ref> He has appeared frequently on the [[Coast to Coast AM  radio show, hosted by [[George Noory .<ref name=""Coast to Coast, Baker""></ref>  === ''WhoWhatWhy'' === Baker is the founder and editor-in-chief of the online website ''WhoWhatWhy,'' which specializes in ""forensic journalism"" and according to Baker, ""embodies a form of investigative reporting that is rigorous, relentless and scientific.""<ref name=""BI 1""></ref> The news site frequently highlights [[Deep state in the United States|deep politics , which Baker describes as ""a vast, secret nexus of power and money that... the mainstream media dare not reveal because they are entwined in that same nexus.""<ref name=""CJR201603"" /><ref name=""wwwstory""></ref>  Articles and reports from ''WhoWhatWhy'' have often been [[News aggregator|picked up  by ''[[The Huffington Post '',<ref name=""HuffPo""></ref> ''[[Business Insider ''<ref name=""BI 2""/> and ''[[Alternet ''.<ref name=""Alternet""></ref>  === ''Family of Secrets'' ===  Baker's 2008  book ''[[Family of Secrets '' outlines historical connections of members of the [[Bush family|Bush political dynasty , including [[Prescott Bush , [[George H.

He said that Baker ""recklessly impugns, in the most disgusting possible way, the reputations not simply of men and women now dead, but of the living,"" Rutten said that though George H.W.

Baker has raised questions about the [[Boston Marathon bombing s, and ""is not willing to rule out the possibility that the bombings were a false-flag operation conducted or permitted by elements of the American government in order to justify the Homeland Security complex.” He argues that FBI recruited the Boston Marathon bomber [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev  as an agent or informant, which is the FBI has categorically denied.<ref name=""Boston - 1-15"" /><ref name=""Coast to Coast""></ref>  ''Boston'' said ""it would be a lot easier to dismiss Baker as a nut and move on if it weren’t for his three decades of award-winning investigative-reporting experience.""<ref name=""Boston - 1-15"" />  Baker says he focuses on ""deep politics"" and engages in  ""forensic journalism"" in which he digs deeper into stories than the [[mainstream media . Journalist [[Bill Moyers  calls him an “indefatigable researcher from whom I could  learn something about a subject that I hadn’t known. A ''[[Columbia Journalism Review '' profile observed that his critics reject his view that mainstream journalism fails to dig, say that ""reporters are warned not to go farther than the evidence warrants, and they say that what Baker sees as audacity is just a cover for sloppy reporting.""<ref name=""CJR201603"" />  Rutten said that Baker once  may have been a serious and talented journalist but became “mesmerized by the idea of secrets and the Great Seduction. It causes you to lose your perspective and balance.” <ref name=""CJR201603"" />  Baker has been on the adjunct faculty of the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism <ref name=""Politico""></ref> and was a contributing editor to the [[Columbia Journalism Review .<ref name=""CJR40""></ref> He has appeared on [[C-SPAN , PBS affiliate stations, on [[RT  TV network |RT , and on radio stations.<ref name=""CJR201603"" /><ref name=""Politico"" /> He has received awards from the New York<ref name=""Deadline"" /> and Northern California chapters of the [[Society of Professional Journalists .  ==Personal life== Baker grew up in [[Venice, California  and graduated from [[UCLA  with a major in [[Political Science .

Circulation is heaviest in the eastern metro region, including [[Ramsey County, Minnesota|Ramsey , [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota , and [[Washington County, Minnesota|Washington  counties, along with western [[Wisconsin , eastern Minnesota and [[Anoka County, Minnesota . The paper's main rival is the ''[[Star Tribune '', based in neighboring [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis . The ''Pioneer Press'' has been owned by [[MediaNews Group  since April 2006.  ==History== [[File:St. Paul Sunday Pioneer Press 8-12-1945.jpg|thumb|left|A ''St. Paul Sunday Pioneer Press'' front page dated August 12, 1945 featuring the first publication of the mushroom cloud during the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima , [[Japan .  The ''Pioneer Press'' traces its history to both the ''Minnesota Pioneer'', [[Minnesota 's first daily newspaper  founded in 1849 by [[James M. Goodhue  , and the ''[[Saint Paul Dispatch ''  launched in 1868 . Ridder Publications acquired the ''Pioneer'' and the ''Dispatch'' in 1927. Ridder merged with Knight Publications to form [[Knight Ridder  in 1974. The two papers were operated for many years as separate morning and evening papers, but in 1985 were merged into the all-day publication the ''St. Paul Pioneer Press and Dispatch'', which later dropped the ""and"" from ""and Dispatch"" in 1986, simply becoming ""St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch."" The publication eventually made the transition to a morning-only paper, and on March 26, 1990, the word ""Dispatch"" was dropped.  The paper is sometimes called the ""Pi Press"", just as ""Strib"" is used for the ''Star Tribune''.  From 1947 to 1949, the newspaper printed the comic strip ''[[Li'l Folks '', by Twin Cities native [[Charles M. Schulz . This comic introduced a number of characters who would later return in 1950 in the syndicated comic strip ''[[Peanuts '', including [[Charlie Brown  and a dog strongly resembling [[Snoopy .  In 1952, the ''Dispatch'' began sponsoring a [[treasure hunt  as part of the [[Saint Paul Winter Carnival . Clues to finding a [[medallion  are printed in the paper, and the first person to find and return it with the clues and a registered carnival button wins a sum of money. The prize started off at $1,000 and as of 2004 rose to $10,000.  The paper has won three [[Pulitzer Prize s: in [[1986 Pulitzer Prize|1986 , [[1988 Pulitzer Prize|1988 , and [[2000 Pulitzer Prize|2000 .  On March 10, 1999, the day before the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|University of Minnesota men's basketball team  was to begin play in the [[1999 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament , the ''Pioneer Press'' published a story written by [[George Dohrmann  with allegations that a staffer wrote coursework for many Minnesota basketball players within the past five years.<ref name=""accused of academic fraud""></ref> Immediately, Minnesota suspended four players suspected of academic fraud, and in 2000, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA  vacated all postseason appearances by Minnesota from 1994 to 1998 and docked scholarships for four years, among other penalties.<ref name=""NYT 2000-10-25""></ref> Dohrmann would win a [[2000 Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer Prize  for [[beat reporting  in 2000 for his reports on the scandal. Dohrmann and his editor prepared for hostile reactions to the newspaper from the local community.<ref name=""PEJ case study""></ref> Minnesota governor [[Jesse Ventura  accused the ''Pioneer Press'' of timing the article to be published around NCAA Tournament time for the sake of ""sensationalism journalism,"" and the ''Pioneer Press'' got many hostile calls and letters in response to the story.<ref name=""AJR 1999""></ref>  [[The McClatchy Company  acquired the paper in June 2006 when it bought [[Knight Ridder . As owner of the ''Star Tribune,'' McClatchy had to sell the ''Pioneer Press'' because of [[antitrust  concerns. The ''Pioneer Press'' was subsequently sold by McClatchy to [[MediaNews Group  later in the year.  The hedge fund [[Alden Global Capital  now owns a controlling share of the ''Pioneer Press''. In its operating year of 2017, ''The Pioneer Press'' under Alden announced a profit of $10 million with a 13% operating margin after Alden cut the newspaper's workforce to around 60 people.

From the beginning, journalists covering political campaigns for ''Politico'' carried a video camera to each assignment,<ref name=""washingtonian""></ref> and they were encouraged to promote their work elsewhere.<ref name=""InternationalHeraldTribune""></ref> By 2008, ''Politico'' received more than three million unique visits per month.  In September 2008, ''[[The New York Times '' reported that ''Politico'' would expand its operations following the 2008 presidential election: ""[A]fter Election Day, [''Politico''] will add reporters, editors, Web engineers and other employees; expand circulation of its newspaper edition in Washington; and print more often."" Between the [[United States elections, 2008|2008  and [[United States elections, 2012|2012  elections, ''Politico''s staff more than tripled in size. Notable additions included two political commentators, [[Michael Kinsley  and [[Joe Scarborough , as opinion writers.  In 2009 the web pages shortened their name from ''The Politico'' to more simply just ''Politico''.  In 2011, ''Politico'' began to focus more on [[long-form journalism  and news analysis.<ref name="":0"" /> This shift in coverage received further support in June 2013 with the hiring of [[Susan Glasser  to oversee ""opinion from prominent outside voices"" and ""long-form storytelling.""<ref name="":6""></ref> In September 2014, Glasser was tapped to serve as ''Politico''s new editor, following the resignation of Richard Berke the previous month.  VandeHei was named ''Politico''s new chief executive in October 2013. Under his leadership, ''Politico'' continued to grow: in 2014 alone, it expanded revenues by 25%. By 2016, ''Politico'' had nearly 500 employees worldwide.

In 1994, ten years after its founding, ''IBD'' was ranked among the fastest-growing newspapers in the country.  In 2005, the political cartoonist [[Michael Ramirez  joined ''IBD''.  In 2008, Ramirez won his second Pulitzer for editorial cartooning while at the company.  In 2015, the ''IBD'' website was accessed by over 4 million monthly visitors.<ref name = tbiz/> In 2016, it was announced that the company would change its printing schedule to once a week, but continue to publish new content to its website daily.<ref name=wallstreet/> In May 2016, the first issue of ''IBD Weekly'' was published while the media outlet continued to publish new digital content daily.<ref name =tb2/>  During the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election in the U.S. , ''IBD'' was one of two polls that correctly predicted a [[Donald Trump  victory. Leading up to the election, ''IBD's'' poll had been dismissed as being an ""outlying survey,"" but it was rated as one of the closest to the final result.   ==Operations== ''IBD'' takes a conservative political stance in its news and analysis. ''IBD'' provides investor education through its Investor's Corner, the Big Picture, and online resources. The information provided expands on William O'Neil's previous books that detail the [[CAN SLIM  investment strategy. ''IBD'' includes several written sections that detail companies and news of interest. It covers internet and technology stocks in particular, and has a substantial editorial and opinion section. Every Monday in its weekly edition, ''IBD'' publishes a list of 50 stocks that are most attractive based on earnings, stock price performance, and other criteria used in the CAN SLIM strategy.  === IBD 50 === '''''The IBD 50 Index''''' is the flagship US stock market benchmark published by the Investor’s Business Daily, similar to how [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE 100  was to the [[Financial Times . The index is based on the CAN SLIM methodology invented by the newspaper’s founder William O’Neil, and the list of its constituents is published every Monday. Later it becomes the basis for an [[exchange-traded fund   ETF  called the '''Innovator IBD 50 ETF'''  Ticker: FFTY , which is also rebalanced weekly.  ==Errors and retractions== In July 2009, an editorial in ''Investor's Business Daily'' claimed that physicist [[Stephen Hawking  ""wouldn't have a chance in the U.K., where the [British] [[National Health Service   NHS  would say the life of this brilliant man, because of his physical handicaps, is essentially worthless."" Hawking was British, lived in the [[United Kingdom  nearly all of his life, and received his medical care from the NHS.  ''IBD'' later removed the editorial's reference to Hawking in its online version and appended an ""Editor's Note"" which said, ""This version corrects the original editorial which implied that physicist Stephen Hawking, a professor at the University of Cambridge, did not live in the UK."" Hawking himself responded, ""I wouldn't be here today if it were not for the NHS.  I have received a large amount of high-quality treatment without which I would not have survived.""  ==References==   ==External links==  * [http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/ IBD educational resources] * [http://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/ IBD videos]  [[Category:American business newspapers  [[Category:Newspapers published in the Greater Los Angeles Area  [[Category:Publications established in 1984  [[Category:Pulitzer Prize-winning newspapers ","Investor's Business Daily  IBD  is an American newspaper and website covering the stock market, international business, finance and economics.

698,Y,marxist.com," |remarks= |image=[[File:IMT-international marxist tendency.jpg|100px  |founder=[[Ted Grant    The '''International Marxist Tendency'''  '''IMT'''  is an international [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist  [[Political international|tendency  founded by [[Ted Grant  and his followers following their break with the [[Committee for a Workers International  in the early 1990s. Their website, Marxist.com, is edited by [[Alan Woods  politician |Alan Woods . The site is multilingual, and publishes international current affairs articles written from a Marxist perspective, as well as a large number of historical and theoretical articles. The IMT is active in over 30 countries worldwide.  ==History==   [[Militant  Trotskyist group |Militant   also known as the Militant tendency  was an [[Entryism|entryist  group within the British [[Labour Party  UK |Labour Party  based around the ''Militant'' newspaper which was founded in 1964. In 1974, Militant and its allies in Sweden, Ireland and other countries formed the [[Committee for a Workers' International . At the time it was the largest Trotskyist organization in Europe. The organisation acquired more members during the 1970s and early 1980s and dominated the Labour Party in [[Liverpool . In 1983, the five members of the ''Militant'' newspaper's editorial board were expelled for contravening the Labour Party constitution and expulsions of Militant members continued throughout the rest of the decade.  Ted Grant was a long time leader of Militant until it split in early 1992 over a number of issues, primarily whether to continue working within the Labour Party. The majority, rejecting entryism, formed Militant Labour, which subsequently became the [[Socialist Party  England and Wales |Socialist Party of England and Wales . Grant argued that leaving Labour would amount to throwing away many decades of patient work and maintained that Marxists should remain within the party. However, he and his supporters were expelled from the tendency and together with [[Alan Woods  politician |Alan Woods  they formed ''[[Socialist Appeal  UK, 1992 |Socialist Appeal '' in Britain.  The factional fight within Militant that led to the expulsion of Grant and Woods also played itself out within the CWI with supporters of the Grant faction leaving to form the Committee for a Marxist International in several countries, particularly Spain.  At its World Congress in 2006, the organisation was renamed the International Marxist Tendency  IMT .  Woods is editor of the British section's journal ''Socialist Appeal'' and of the IMT website, ''In Defence of Marxism''  Marxist.com .  ==Theory and tactics== The International Marxist Tendency adheres to [[Orthodox Trotskyism , emphasising the education of cadres of workers and youth.  The IMT manifesto makes demands such as ""the end to privatisation and the abandonment of market economics"", ""the nationalisation of privatised companies without compensation"" and ""the reintroduction of the state monopoly of foreign trade"".  ==National sections== The IMT claims sections in many countries worldwide, including ''Esquerda Marxista'' in Brazil, ''Sinistra classe rivoluzione'' in Italy, ''Vonk'' in the Netherlands, ''Fightback'' in Canada, and ''Socialist Appeal'' in Britain.   Its section in France, ''Révolution''  formerly La Riposte , practiced entryism in the [[French Communist Party ; in 2008, ''La Riposte'' supported an alternative platform at the PCF party conference which received the support of 15% of voters. Then, ''Révolution'' left the French Communist Party and have become member of [[La France Insoumise  while La Riposte are staying to the party and are no longer a section of the International Marxist Tendency.  The IMT's [[Brazil ian section, ''Esquerda Marxista''  Marxist Left  was formerly a recognized tendency within the ruling [[Workers' Party  Brazil |Workers' Party  and has a majority in the ''Movimento Negro Socialista''  Socialist Black Movement, MNS . On 5 May 2015, the Brazilian section announced its withdrawal from the [[Workers' Party  Brazil |Workers' Party , citing the failure of this party to stand up to austerity and its support for police repression of protest movements.   Two members of the Greek Section  Communist Platform of SYRIZA  were elected to the Central Committee of [[SYRIZA  during its founding congress in July 2013. This faction has since pushed within SYRIZA for the rejection of austerity, and for the party to carry out socialist policies. This organization's positions have gained the attention of the ''Wall Street Journal'', which interviewed some members as part of an article on 23 June 2015. The Communist Tendency joined the newly founded [[Popular Unity  Greece |Popular Unity  following its split from SYRIZA.   The Mexican section, La Izquierda Socialista, has been active in the [[National Regeneration Movement . Several members of the Mexican section were mentioned by name in articles by the Conservative newspaper ''[[La Razón  Mexico |La Razón ''. These articles took note of these members large role in student struggles at [[Instituto Politécnico Nacional , and accused them of being outside agitators linked to the left-wing writer and politician [[Paco Ignacio Taibo II . On August 26, 2015 members of La Izquerda Socialista were injured in a confrontation with riot police after leaving an ""Ayotzinapa"" protest in Mexico city. Among the injured was Ubaldo Meneses, editor of the organization's newspaper, and a member of the national council of MORENA.  In preparation for the [[Italian general election, 2018|Italian general election in 2018 , the IMT's section  Left, Class, Revolution  launched the [[For a Revolutionary Left  electoral alliance with the [[Workers' Communist Party  Italy |Workers' Communist Party , the Italian section of the [[Coordinating Committee for the Refoundation of the Fourth International   CRFI . The alliance received 0.08% of the vote.  Since the rapid growth of the [[Democratic Socialists of America  since the 2016 presidential election in the United States, US members of the IMT have joined DSA chapters around the country.  == Sections of the IMT ==  {| class=""wikitable"" !Section !Name of the Publication !English Name !Connection to mass parties |- | Argentina |El Militante |Militant | |- | Austria |Der Funke |The Spark |[[Socialist Youth Austria  |- | Belgium |in [[Wallonia : Unité Socialiste in [[Flanders : Vonk |Socialist Unity The Spark |[[Parti Socialiste  Belgium |Socialist Party  [[Socialistische Partij Anders|Socialist Party Differently  |- | Bolivia |Lucha de Clases |Class Struggle |[[Movement for Socialism  Bolivia |Movement for Socialism  |- | Brazil |Esquerda Marxista |Marxist Left  |[[Socialism and Liberty Party  |- | Canada |Fightback |Fightback  |[[New Democratic Party  |- | Czech Republic |Marxistická Alternativa |Marxist Alternative  | |- |- | Denmark |Revolution |Revolution | |- | El Salvador |Bloque Popular Juvenil |United Front of the Youth  |[[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front  |- | England and Wales |[[Socialist Appeal  UK, 1992 |Socialist Appeal  |Socialist Appeal |[[Labour Party UK|Labour Party  |- | France |Révolution |Revolution |[[La France insoumise  |- | Germany |Der Funke – Marxistische Linke |The Spark – Marxist Left  |[[The Left  Germany |The Left  |- | Greece |Κομμουνιστική Τάση Kommunistiki Tási |Communist Tendency | |- | Indonesia |Militan |Militant | |- | Iran |مبارزه طبقاتی Mobāreze-ye Tabaqāti |Class Struggle | |- | Ireland |Fightback |Fightback |[[Labour Party  Ireland |Labour Party  |- | Italy |Sinistra classe rivoluzione |Left, Class, Revolution  |[[For a Revolutionary Left  |- | Malaysia |Pembebasan |Relief | |- | México  |La Izquierda Socialista |The Socialist Left  |[[National Regeneration Movement  |- | Morocco  |رابطة العمل الشيوعي  Rābita al-'amal al-shuyu'ī |Communist League  | |- | Netherlands |Revolutie |Revolution | |- | New Zealand  |Socialist Appeal |Socialist Appeal |[[New Zealand Labour Party  |- | Nigeria |Workers' Alternative |Workers' Alternative  | |- | Pakistan |لال سلام Lal Salaam |Red Front | |- | Québec |La Riposte |Fightback |[[Québec Solidaire  |- | Russia |Враг Капитала Vrag Kapitala |Enemy of the Capital  | |- | Scotland |Revolution |Revolution | |- | Serbia  Bosnia and Herzegovina   Macedonia |Crvena Kritika Црвена Критика |Red Critique |  |- | South Africa  |Revolution |Revolution |[[Economic Freedom Fighters  |- | Spain |Lucha de Clases |Class Struggle |[[Podemos  Spanish political party |Podemos  |- | Sweden |Revolution |Revolution |[[Left Party  Sweden |Left Party  |- | Switzerland | in [[German-speaking Switzerland|German Switzerland : Der Funke in [[Romandy : L'étincelle |The Spark  |[[Young Socialists Switzerland  |- | United States  |Socialist Revolution |US Section of the IMT | |- | Venezuela |Lucha de Clases |Class Struggle  |[[United Socialist Party of Venezuela  |}  ==Activity== [[Image:Alanwoodsconhugochavez.jpg|thumb|left|Leading theoretician of the International Marxist Tendency [[Alan Woods  politician |Alan Woods , in a meeting with Venezuelan president [[Hugo Chávez .  [[File:In defence marxism.jpg|thumb|Logo of the ''In Defence Of Marxism'' website  Just as the Committee for a Worker's International pursued a policy of [[entryism  within traditional mass social democratic parties up until the early 1990s, IMT groups across the world pursue this method in their respective Labour Parties  where they exist , some [[Communist Party|Communist Parties  such as those in [[France  and [[Italy  and, in some countries, mass populist parties such as the [[Pakistan Peoples Party . This work, however, is typically combined with independent work outside these parties and with a strong observance of not liquidating the organisation within them. The IMT's section in the [[United States  does not pursue entryism, instead supporting a campaign for a [[trade union -backed Labour Party.  The IMT has spread to parts of Latin America, where it now has groups in [[Venezuela , [[Peru , [[Argentina , [[Mexico , [[Bolivia , [[Brazil  and [[El Salvador . At the end of 2002 it promoted the launching of the solidarity campaign at [[Hands Off Venezuela , which is now active in 30 countries and has had resolutions passed within the trade union movements in Britain, Canada, Italy and other countries. IMT activists also play an important role in FRETECO  Front of Factories Under Workers' Control  movement in Brazil and Venezuela. They have been very active in Venezuela, where their section supports [[Hugo Chavez  while promoting the ideas of Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky. In 2010 Ramon Muchacho, leader of the main Venezuelan opposition party [[Justice First|Primero Justicia , claimed that Alan Woods of the IMT was the ""principal ideological adviser and personal friend"" of Chávez, a claim played down by Alan Woods.<ref name=""WMail Dec 2010""></ref>  Every year all the sections of tendency take part in a large event that is either a World Congress or a World School of Marxism. The function of the congress is to discuss the progress of IMT in the world, present reports and plan the future activities, whilst the World School is aimed mainly to deepen the knowledge of Marxist theory, history of workers' movement and the actual situation of the struggle for world socialism.  In the first days of March 2009 the International Marxist Tendency organised a Marxist School in Mexico, where revolutionaries from all over North, South and Central America gathered in order to discuss the work done in each country, as well as Marxist ideas and perspectives for the movement. Notably present at one of the Meetings was [[Esteban Volkov , grandson of Trotsky who described Alan Woods as one of Trotsky's best followers. Also in this event, a new theoretical magazine was launched, called ''America Socialista'', currently published in Spanish, but which is intended to eventually also be published in Portuguese, English and French.<ref name=""school""></ref>  In 2012 the IMT published an article denouncing the attempted assassination of [[Malala Yousafzai , claiming she is an IMT sympathizer and showing a picture of her speaking at an IMT school in [[Swat District|Swat , [[Pakistan .<ref name=""IDOM Malala""></ref> Woods's statement has been used to interpret Yousafzai's politics<ref name=""Malala Stopwar""></ref><ref name=""Mslala Dawn""></ref> and to speculate on whether she has a communist or anti-religious agenda.<ref name=""Malala Kashmir""></ref> Yousafzai sent greetings to the 9 March 2013 congress of the Pakistani section of the IMT, in which she said, ""I am convinced Socialism is the only answer and I urge all comrades to take this struggle to a victorious conclusion. Only this will free us from the chains of bigotry and exploitation.""<ref name=""Waraich""></ref>  ==2009–2010–2016–2017 splits== In late 2009 a dispute developed between the IMT leadership and the leaderships of its sections in Spain  ''El Militante'' , Venezuela  [[Corriente Marxista Revolucionaria   and Mexico. In January 2010, these organisations, together with the group in Colombia and part of the section in Mexico, broke with the IMT and established a new international body, the ''Izquierda Revolucionaria''  Revolutionary Left .<ref name=""CPGB Feb2010""></ref> Minorities in Venezuela and Spain chose to remain with the IMT and set up new sections. The new IMT Venezuelan section launched their newspaper, ''Lucha de Clases'', in April 2010. In 2016, the [[Corriente Marxista Revolucionaria  issued a joint declaration with the [[Committee for a Workers International  announcing that the organizations are conducting joint work.   In the same year, another smaller split occurred. The majority of the Swedish section, factions in Poland and Britain and individuals from several other sections left the IMT to form a new group called [[Towards a New International Tendency . The Iranian section of the IMT also split away over the international's position on Venezuela's friendly relations with the Iranian government and in 2011 launched ''Marxist Revival'' with co-thinkers in Britain.   In 2016 the Pakistani section split, with the majority leaving, while the minority reorganized as ""Lal Salaam""  Red Salute .   In April 2017, the IMT suffered a split in its Brazilian section.  ==Publications== In addition to the international website, each national section has its own website in that country's respective language s . There is also a quantity of audio and video material on the site. The IMT operates a publisher, Wellred Books which publishes a number of books by Trotsky, Alan Woods and other authors and sells them through its online bookstore and supplies IMT sections with material for their book stalls. The IMT regularly publishes international theoretical periodicals, such as ''In Defence of Marxism'', ""America Socialista"" and ''Asian Marxist Review''.  The site's name, ''In Defence of Marxism'', is derived from the title given to a collection of letters and articles by Trotsky.  The tendency has been criticised by some left groups for placing too much emphasis on 'abstract' theoretical topics such as Marxism and art, or the class struggles in the Roman Republic.  ==References==   ==External links==  * *[http://www.socialistappeal.org U.S. Website] *[http://www.wellredbooks.net/ Publishing  UK ] *[http://www.marxistbooks.com Publishing  US ]  [[Category:International Marxist Tendency|  ","The International Marxist Tendency  IMT  is an international Trotskyist tendency founded by Ted Grant and his followers following their break with the Committee for a Workers International in the early 1990s.

Basu and five other top officials of Doordarshan under Section 120-B of the [[Indian Penal Code   IPC  for criminal conspiracy and under the Prevention of Corruption Act. According to the [[Central Bureau of Investigation   CBI  charge-sheet, Doordarshan suffered a loss of over Rs 35.2&nbsp;million due to the ""undue favours"" shown to NDTV as its programme ''The World This Week''  ''TWTW''  was put in 'A' category instead of 'special A' category.  ===Radia tapes controversy===   In November 2010, ''[[OPEN magazine '' carried a story which reported transcripts of some of the telephone conversations of [[Nira Radia  with senior journalists, politicians, and corporate houses, many of whom have denied the allegations. The [[Central Bureau of Investigation  has announced that they have 5,851 recordings of phone conversations by Radia, some of which outline Radia's attempts to broker deals in relation to the 2G spectrum sale. The tapes appear to demonstrate how Radia attempted to use some media persons including NDTV's [[Barkha Dutt  to influence the decision to appoint [[A. Raja  as telecom minister. During CBI investigation, Dutt apologized for her role in the scandal stating that it is simply an 'error of judgment' on her part. She left the channel in January 2017.  ===Allegation of tax fraud=== NDTV, through its foreign subsidiaries, is alleged to have violated Indian tax and corporate laws.

On 19 November 2015 the [[Enforcement Directorate|ED  served  notice to NDTV for alleged violations under the [[Foreign Exchange Management Act|FEMA  act, however the company said it has been advised that the allegations are not ""legally tenable"".

Regarding an investment by the US TV network, NBC  an 80% subsidiary of GE at the time  into NDTV Networks of $150million dollars, both NDTV and NBC/GE insist was an absolutely legal and bona fide investment while the IT department claims it is an illegal transaction. NDTV has called it the Indian Authorities variant of “McCarthyism” to suppress the media.  ===Commonwealth Games contract===  On 5 August 2011 [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India 's report on [[XIX Commonwealth Games  was tabled in [[Parliament of India . In section 14.4.2 of the report, CAG alleged that while awarding contracts worth  for production and broadcast of commercials to promote CWG-2010 to NDTV & CNN-IBN, the Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee followed an arbitrary approach. Proposals were considered in an ad-hoc manner, as and when a proposal was received; no form of competitive tendering was adopted. The CAG further said in its report that, ""We had no assurance about the competitiveness of the rates quoted by these channels and the need and usefulness of these proposals. From March 2010 to June 2010, the entire pre games publicity and sponsorship publicity was done only on NDTV & CNN-IBN.""  ===Suit against TAM India===  News broadcaster company sued television audience measurement company, TAM India and its global parent firms for over a billion dollars in the Supreme Court of New York, alleging TAM of manipulating ratings in return for bribes to its officials.  ===One-day ban=== On November 4, 2016, the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting ordered the channel to go off air on November 9 for allegedly divulging 'strategically sensitive' details while covering [[2016 Pathankot attack|January's deadly attack on the Pathankot air base .

He added that while the amount was repaid the following year, the accrued interest of  remained unpaid. In its response, NDTV denied any ""default on any loan to ICICI or any other bank"", while attaching a picture of the bank's 2009 letter that confirmed that the ""entire amount due,"" amounting to , had ""been repaid in full."" It added that, ""No matter how much the politicians attack us - We will not give up the fight for freedom and the independence of media in India.""  While the [[Minister of Information and Broadcasting  India |Minister of Information and Broadcasting  [[Venkaiah Naidu  denied involvement in the investigation adding that ""this government doesn't believe in interfering"", media outlets held the [[Government of India|union government  responsible for breach of the [[freedom of the press .

Booth Newspapers owned ''[[The Ann Arbor News '' which ceased printing in July 2009 and was re-established as [[AnnArbor.com  with a Thursday and Sunday newspaper and website independent of the other Booth properties. In 2013 [[AnnArbor.com  joined '''MLive Media Group''', which was established in 2012 as the Michigan brand for [[Advance Publications .  At that time, AnnArbor.com's web presence was integrated with the other Michigan properties under the '''MLive.com''' URL and the [[AnnArbor.com  newspaper returned to its historical identity as ''[[The Ann Arbor News ''.

All of Advance Publications’ Michigan content is published on Mlive.com.  ==History== Booth Newspapers was founded by [[George Gough Booth  and his brothers in 1893.  In 1976, [[Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr.  of [[Advance Publications  acquired Booth Newspapers for $305 million.  The Herald Company, Inc. merged with Booth Newspapers, Inc. in July 1987.  In September 2002, Booth Newspapers acquired [[21st Century Newspapers , Inc.'s [[Heritage Newspapers ' Suburban Flint Newspaper Group which has nine local papers: ''[[Clio Messenger '', ''[[Davison Flagstaff '', ''[[Fenton Press '', ''[[Grand Blanc News '', ''[[Flint Township News '', ''[[Flushing Observer '', ''[[Holly Press '', ''[[Suburban Burton '', and ''[[Swartz Creek News '', and included ''Suburban Flint Shopper''.  All of these operate with ''The Flint Journal'' as the Community Newspapers.  In December 2006, the Herald Company, Inc. merged with Advance Magazine Publisher, Inc. but continues to operate under the Booth Newspapers name in Michigan.  On November 3, 2008, the day before the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election , many copies of Booth newspapers were delivered inside a white advertising wrapper, paid for by the [[National Rifle Association , with ""Defend Freedom, Defeat [[Barack Obama|Obama "" written across the outside.  The bags were mostly reported with ''The Flint Journal'', but there were also similar reports from customers of ''The Saginaw News'' and ''The Bay City Times''.<ref name=""wjrt-sleeve""></ref>  ''The Flint Journal'' posted a short apology on its website that stated that ""The wrapper was supposed to be inserted into the newspaper.""  The ''Journal'' also told [[WJRT-TV , who also received a flood of calls about the incident, that there was ""some miscommunication"" with the paper carriers.<ref name=""wjrt-sleeve"" />  The three papers mentioned endorsed Barack Obama for president.  On March 23, 2009, Booth Newspapers announced in ''The Ann Arbor News'' that it would end the paper's 174-year print run in July 2009, due to economic difficulties, and be replaced by ''[[AnnArbor.com '', a daily web paper that will have a twice-weekly print edition.  Also on this date, Booth announced that beginning June 1, 2009, ''The Bay City Times'', ''The Saginaw News'' and ''The Flint Journal'' would reduce publishing to three times a week—Thursday, Friday and Sunday, while increasing their web presence; the three newspapers would add a Tuesday edition in March 2010, with ''The Bay City Times'' and ''The Saginaw News'' sharing an edition.  On February 2, 2012, Booth Newspapers split into two companies:  MLive Media Group and Advance Central Services Michigan.  MLive Group handles advertising and news for all newspapers and websites.  Advance Services handles human resource, production, and distribution.  At the same time, home delivery of Booth's remaining daily newspapers was reduced to Tuesday, Thursdays and Sundays with subscribers receiving e-editions on the other days in which they print.  Also in 2012, Mlive contracted with former [[WEYI-TV  meteorologist Mark Torregrossa to run the website's weather section with expectation of increasing the sections views from 900,000 to 1 million. Instead by 2014, the section received on average 5 million to 6 million page views with a high in January 2014 of 13 million.  ==References==   ==External links==  *  *     [[Category:Newspapers published in Michigan  [[Category:Newspaper companies of the United States  [[Category:Companies based in Grand Rapids, Michigan  [[Category:Advance Publications  [[Category:1976 mergers and acquisitions ","Booth Newspapers, or Booth Michigan, was a media company based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

In December 1930 CBS chief [[William S. Paley  hired journalist [[Paul White  journalist |Paul W. White  away from United Press as CBS's news editor. Paley put the radio network's news operation at the same level as entertainment, and authorized White to interrupt programming if events warranted. Along with other networks, CBS chafed at the [[breaking news  embargo imposed upon radio by the wire services, which prevented them from using bulletins until they first appeared in print. CBS disregarded an embargo when it broke the story of the [[Lindbergh kidnapping  in 1932, using live on-the-air reporting. Radio networks scooped print outlets with news of the [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential election .<ref name=""Dunning"">[[John Dunning  writer |Dunning, John , ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''.

""CBS was getting its ducks in a row for the biggest news story in history, World War II"", wrote radio historian John Dunning.<ref name=""Dunning""/>  ===Television=== Upon becoming commercial station WCBW  channel 2, now [[WCBS-TV   in 1941, the pioneer CBS television station in New York City broadcast two daily news programs, at 2:30 and 7:30&nbsp;p.m. weekdays, anchored by [[Richard Hubbell . Most of the newscasts featured Hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map or still photograph. When [[Bombing of Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor  was bombed on December 7, 1941, WCBW  which was usually off the air on Sunday to give the engineers a day off , took to the air at 8:45&nbsp;p.m. with an extensive special report. The national emergency even broke down the unspoken wall between CBS radio and television. WCBW executives convinced radio announcers and experts such as George Fielding Elliot and Linton Wells to come down to the Grand Central studios during the evening and give information and commentary on the attack. The WCBW special report that night lasted less than 90 minutes. But that special broadcast pushed the limits of live television in 1941 and opened up new possibilities for future broadcasts. As CBS wrote in a special report to the FCC, the unscheduled live news broadcast on December 7 ""was unquestionably the most stimulating challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up to that time.""  Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of the war. In May 1942, WCBW  like almost all television stations  sharply cut back its live program schedule and the newscasts were canceled, since the station temporarily suspended studio operations, resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films. This was primarily because much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed to war related technical research, and to prolong the life of the early, unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the wartime lack of parts. [[File:Douglas Edwards With the News CBS 1952.JPG|thumb|200px|Douglas Edwards on the CBS news set in 1952.  In May 1944, as the war began to turn in favor of the Allies, WCBW reopened the studios and the newscasts returned, briefly anchored by [[Ned Calmer , and then by [[Everett Holles . After the war, expanded news programs appeared on the WCBW schedule – whose call letters were changed to WCBS-TV in 1946 – first anchored by [[Milo Boulton , and later by [[Douglas Edwards . On May 3, 1948, Edwards began anchoring ''CBS Television News'', a regular 15-minute nightly newscast on the CBS television network, including WCBS-TV. It aired every weeknight at 7:30&nbsp;p.m., and was the first regularly scheduled, network television news program featuring an anchor  the nightly [[Lowell Thomas  NBC radio network newscast was simulcast on television locally on NBC's WNBT—now [[WNBC —for a time in the early 1940s and the previously mentioned Richard Hubbell, Ned Calmer, Everett Holles and Milo Boulton on WCBW in the early and mid-1940s, but these were local television broadcasts seen only in New York City . [[NBC 's offering at the time, ''NBC Television Newsreel''  which premiered in February 1948 , was simply film footage with voice narration.  In 1950, the name of the nightly newscast was changed to ''Douglas Edwards with the News'', and the following year, it became the first news program to be broadcast on both coasts, thanks to a new coaxial cable connection, prompting Edwards to use the greeting ""Good evening everyone, coast to coast."" The broadcast was renamed the ''[[CBS Evening News '' when [[Walter Cronkite  replaced Edwards in 1962. Edwards remained with CBS News with various daytime television newscasts and radio news broadcasts until his retirement on April 1, 1988.  ==Broadcast history==  The information on programs listed in this section came directly from CBS News in interviews with the Vice President of Communications and NewsWatch Dallas.  According to the CBS News Library and source Sandy Genelius  Vice President, CBS News Communications , the ""CBS Evening News"" was the program title for both Saturday and Sunday evening broadcasts. The program title for the Sunday late night news beginning in 1963 was the ""CBS Sunday Night News"". These titles were also seen on the intro slide of the program's opening. The program airs on Saturday, and Sunday nights at 7:00 - 7:30PM UTC  Eastern Time  on CBS.

The channel feature live news from 9am to midnight on weekdays. The channel makes all of the resources of CBS News available directly on digital platforms with live, anchored coverage 15 hours each week. It is a first for a U.S. 24-hour news channel to forgo cable and be available exclusively only on line and on smart devices such as smart TV's [[Apple TV , [[Roku , [[Amazon Fire  and others. The Channel is based at CBS's New York City headquarters.  ==CBS Newspath== CBS Newspath is CBS News' satellite news-gathering service  similar to [[CNN Newsource  . Newspath provides national hard news, sports highlights, regional spot news, features and live coverage of major [[breaking news  events for affiliate stations to use in their local news broadcasts. The service has a team of domestic and global correspondents and freelance reporters dedicated to reporting for affiliates, and offers several different national or international stories fronted by reporters on a daily basis. CBS Newspath also relies heavily on local affiliates sharing content. Stations will often contribute locally obtained footage that may be of national interest. It replaced a similar service, CBS News NewsNet.  '''Network News Service  NNS ''' is a pioneering news organization formed by ABC NewsOne, CBS Newspath and Fox NewsEdge. Launched in June 2000, its subscriber list already includes more than 500 ABC, CBS and Fox affiliates throughout the United States. The three news distributors created NNS to cost-effectively pool resources for developing and delivering second tier news stories and b-roll footage. The goal was to realize cost savings in the creation and distribution of these news images, while news organizations and member television stations continued to independently develop and deliver their own signature coverage of top news stories.  ==CBS News Radio==  The branch of CBS News that produces newscasts and features to radio stations is CBS News Radio. The radio network is the oldest unit of CBS and traced its roots to the company's founding in 1927, and the news division took shape over the decade that followed. The list of CBS News correspondents  below  includes those reporting on CBS News Radio.  CBS News Radio produces the oldest daily news show on radio or television, the ''[[CBS World News Roundup '', which first aired in 1938 and celebrates its 80th anniversary in 2018. The ''World News Roundup'' airs twice every weekday: a morning edition is anchored by Steve Kathan and produced by Paul Farry, while a ""late edition"" is anchored by Dave Barrett and produced by James Hutton.

727,Y,couriermail.com.au,"      '''''The Courier-Mail''''' is a daily tabloid newspaper published in [[Brisbane , Australia. Owned by [[News Corp Australia , it is published daily from Monday to Saturday in [[Tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid  format. Its editorial offices are located at [[Bowen Hills, Queensland|Bowen Hills , in Brisbane's inner northern suburbs, and it is printed at [[Murarrie, Queensland|Murarrie , in Brisbane's eastern suburbs. It is available for purchase throughout [[Queensland , most regions of Northern [[New South Wales  and parts of the [[Northern Territory .  ==History== The history of ''The Courier-Mail'' is through four mastheads. The ''[[Moreton Bay Courier '' later became ''[[The Courier  Brisbane |The Courier '', then the ''[[Brisbane Courier '' and since 1933 ''The Courier-Mail''.  The ''Moreton Bay Courier'' was established as a weekly paper in June 1846. Issue frequency increased steadily to bi-weekly in January 1858, tri-weekly in December 1859, then daily under the editorship of [[Theophilus Parsons Pugh  from 14 May 1861. The recognised founder and first editor was [[Arthur Sidney Lyon   1817–1861  who was assisted by its printer, [[James Swan  mayor of Brisbane |James Swan   1811–1891 , the later [[mayor of Brisbane  and member of [[Queensland Legislative Council . Lyon, also referred to as the ""father of the Press"" in the colony of Queensland, had previously served as a writer and journalist in Melbourne, and later moved on to found and edit journals such as ''Moreton Bay Free Press'', ''[[North Australian '' and ''[[Darling Downs Gazette ''. Lyon was encouraged to emigrate by Rev. Dr. [[John Dunmore Lang  and arrived in [[Brisbane  from Sydney in early 1846 to establish a newspaper. He persuaded James Swan, a printer of Lang's Sydney newspaper ''[[The Colonialist '' to join him. Lyon and Swan established themselves on the corner of [[Queen Street, Brisbane|Queen Street  and [[Albert Street, Brisbane , in a garret of a building later known as the North Star Hotel. The first issue of the ''Moreton Bay Courier'', consisting of 4 pages, appeared weekly on Saturday 20 June 1846, with Lyon as [[editor in chief|editor  and Swan as publisher.  After some 18 months, Lyon and Swan disagreed on many aspects of editorial policy, including transportation of convicts and [[squatting . Lyon took over sole control in late 1847, but had money problems, and gave sole control to Swan. Swan sold out to [[Thomas Blacket Stephens  in about November 1859.<ref name=""jubilee""></ref>''The Moreton Bay Courier'' became ''The Courier'', and then the ''Brisbane Courier'' in 1864.  In June–July 1868, Stephens floated a new company, and transferred the plant and copyright of the ''Brisbane Courier'' to ""The Brisbane Newspaper Company"". He was the managing director until retired in November 1873, when the paper was auctioned.  The Journal was, from November 1873 to December 1880, managed by one of the new part owners, the Tasmanian-born former public servant [[Gresley Lukin   1840–1916 . Although called 'managing editor', actual writing and editing was by [[William Augustine O'Carroll   1831–1885 . Most prominent of the various editors and sub-editors of the Queenslander 'literary staff' were [[William Henry Traill   1842–1902 , later NSW politician and editor of the famed Sydney journal '[[The Bulletin  Australian periodical |The Bulletin ', and [[Carl Feilberg|Carl Adolph Feilberg   1844–1887 , who was Danish born but from the age of six educated in England and later in France. Carl Feilberg followed William Henry Trail in the role of political commentator and the de facto editor of the ''Queenslander'' to January 1881. He succeeded William O'Carroll as Courier editor-in-chief from September 1883 to his death in October 1887. Lukin's roles as part owner-editor changed on 21 December 1880. [[Charles Hardie Buzacott   1835–1918 , former 'Postmaster General' in the first McIlwraith government, had been a staff journalist. [[John James Knight   1863–1927  was editor-in-chief of the ''Brisbane Courier'' 1906–16, later managing director, then chairman of all the company's publications.  The first edition of ''The Courier-Mail'' was published on 28 August 1933, after [[Keith Murdoch 's [[The Herald and Weekly Times|Herald and Weekly Times  acquired and merged the ''Brisbane Courier'' and the ''[[Daily Mail  Brisbane |Daily Mail ''  first published on 3 October 1903 . In 1987, [[Rupert Murdoch 's [[News Corp Australia|News Limited  acquired newspaper control, and outstanding shares of Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd.  ''The Courier-Mail'' was inducted into the [[Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame  in 2015.  ==Political position== ''The Courier-Mail'' is a right leaning newspaper with four editorial endorsements for the coalition to one for Labor in the period 1996–2007. ''The Courier-Mail'' generally supports [[free market  economic policies and the process of [[globalisation . It supported the [[2003 invasion of Iraq .  ==Circulation and readership== ''The Courier-Mail'' has the fourth-highest circulation of any daily newspaper in Australia. Its average Monday-Friday net paid print sales were 172,801 between January and March 2013, having fallen 8.0 per cent compared to the previous year. Its average Saturday net paid print sales were 228,650 between January and March 2013, down 10.5 per cent compared to the previous year.<ref name=""News2013""></ref>  The paper's Monday-Friday readership was 488,000 in March 2013, having fallen 11.6 per cent compared to the previous year. Its Saturday readership was 616,000 in March 2013, down 13.8 per cent compared to the previous year.<ref name=""News2013"" /> Around three-quarters of the paper's readership is located in the Brisbane [[metropolitan area .  Although often claimed to be Brisbane's only daily newspaper since the demise of [[Queensland Newspapers ' own afternoon newspaper ''[[Telegraph  Brisbane |The Telegraph '' in 1988, it arguably has had two competitors since 2007. [[News Corp  company |News Corp  itself published ''[[mX  newspaper |mX '', a free afternoon newspaper, since 2007, but ''mX'' had a relatively low news content, and was discontinued in mid 2015.

The headline refers to the [[2005 Cronulla riots .  From its inception until March 2006 ''The Courier-Mail'' was a broadsheet newspaper. On 14 December 2005 it was announced that the paper would change to a [[Tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid  sometime in early 2006, however the term ""tabloid"" was not used in favour of the term ""compact"". This linguistic choice was probably related to widespread public view that many tabloids, including those published by [[News Corp Australia|News Limited , were low quality publications  see [[Tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid  for discussion of this size and quality issue . Much emphasis was made that it was merely the paper size that was changing and not the journalistic quality. The last broadsheet edition was published on Saturday 11 March 2006, and the first tabloid edition was published on Monday 13 March 2006. On the same day, the paper's website was revamped and expanded.  The change to a tabloid format brought ''The Courier-Mail'' in line with all other [[News Corp Australia|News Limited  Australian metropolitan daily newspapers. This followed the change to a tabloid format by ''[[The Advertiser  Australia |The Advertiser '' of [[Adelaide —another News Corporation newspaper—some years earlier. Despite the claims that there would be no loss of journalistic quality, ''The Courier-Mail'' in its ""compact"" format is not well regarded for its journalism, e.g. the 'Crikey' website described it as ""one of the contestants in a close run field for worst paper in Australia"". In August 2011, police and the parents of a murder victim criticized the paper for falsely accusing their son of a child sex crime.  On 24 March 2014 [[Queensland Newspapers , the News Corp Australia subsidiary responsible for publishing the ''Courier-Mail'', was found guilty by a District Court of breaching restrictions on publishing Family Court proceedings on four occasions and fined a total of $120,000. The breachs occurred in 2012 when the ''Courier-Mail'' published on its front page the names and photos of a mother and her children involved in a Family Court dispute. District Court Justice Terence Martin said: ""It seems to me that the newspaper seized upon what it regarded as a sensational story, which would be attractive to readers, and put the story ahead of its legal obligations"".  ==Criticism== ''The Courier-Mail'' has been viewed as controversial on several occasions. One particular instance, on 7 October 2014, the paper published a transphobic headline related to the gruesome murder of Mayang Prasetyo.  == Digitisation == Pre-1955 issues of the newspaper have been digitised as part of the [[Australian Newspapers Digitisation Program   of the [[National Library of Australia .  ==See also==  * ''[[The Sunday Mail  Brisbane |The Sunday Mail '' * [[List of newspapers in Australia    ==References==   ==Further reading== * ''Brisbane Courier'' 29 January 1895, p2.

728,Y,globalnews.ca,"    '''Global News''' is the news and current affairs division of the [[Global Television Network  in [[Canada , itself owned by [[Corus Entertainment , overseeing all of the network's national news programming as well as local news on its 15 [[owned-and-operated station s.  Corus also operates several [[talk radio  stations under the ""Global News Radio"" brand.  ==National programs== Global's lineup of national news and current affairs programming is as follows:  * ''[[The Morning Show  Canadian TV series |The Morning Show '': Weekdays 9:00 a.m. ET/CT/MT/PT, 10:00 a.m. AT * ''[[Global National '': Nightly 7:30 p.m. NT, 6:30 p.m. AT/ET, 5:30 p.m. CT/MT/PT, 6:00 p.m. Kelowna * ''[[The West Block '': Sundays 10:00 a.m. PT/MT, 11:00 a.m. ET/CT, 12:00 Noon AT  Although Global stations had always carried local news in various forms, the first tentative steps towards a national presence came in 1994 with the launch of ''[[First National  television show |First National '' with [[Peter Kent , an early-evening program focusing on national and international news but airing only in central Canada. After acquiring the [[Western International Communications   WIC  group of stations, Global cancelled ''First National'' in February 2001 and briefly aired the similar WIC newscast ''[[Canada Tonight '' in its place.  In September 2001, Global replaced ''Canada Tonight'' with a new network newscast, ''[[Global National '', anchored by [[Kevin Newman  Canadian journalist |Kevin Newman   now presented by [[Dawna Friesen  .  It aired from the network's new national news centre at [[CHAN-DT|CHAN-TV 's studio in [[Burnaby, British Columbia . The program initially aired only on weekdays, then launched a weekend edition anchored by [[Tara Nelson   now at [[CFCN-DT|CTV Calgary   in February 2005  now presented by [[Robin Gill  journalist |Robin Gill  . Originally airing in different timeslots around the country, the program moved to a standard 5:30 p.m.  6:30 p.m. Atlantic  start time nationwide in 2006. Since then, ''Global National'' has quickly gained ground on longtime number-one ''[[CTV National News '', overtaking it on several occasions. A [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin  version of the newscast, titled ''Global National Mandarin'', launched on January 23, 2012 with anchor Carol Wang, and is seen weeknights on [[Shaw Multicultural Channel  in Vancouver and Calgary.  On January 7, 2013, the network extended its [[CIII-DT|Toronto owned-and-operated station's  morning program  ''[[The Morning Show  Canadian TV series |The Morning Show ''  by 30 minutes, with this additional half-hour airing across its other owned-and-operated stations; prior to this, Global did not air a national [[morning show . In addition, the network's owned-and-operated stations in select markets produce their own local morning shows  see [[#Local programs|below  ; stations which do not produce a local morning show either air the morning show from a larger market, or run daytime programming repeated from [[Shaw Media 's cable [[specialty channel s, such as ''Crash Test Mommy'' and ''The Mom Show''.  Global launched its first investigative [[newsmagazine  series on November 30, 2008.  The weekly program, titled ''[[16x9 - The Bigger Picture '', features a high-gloss, tabloid format, and is the network's first foray into the field long occupied by CTV's ''[[W-FIVE '' and CBC's ''[[The Fifth Estate  TV |the fifth estate ''. Global also formerly aired a weekly [[Documentary film|documentary  series, ''[[Global Currents ''.  During the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 federal election , Global News also produced a weekly series, ''Focus: Decision Canada'', covering news and issues in the election campaign. The show, hosted by weekend ''Global National'' anchor Carolyn Jarvis, was a nominee for Best Information Program or Series at the [[2011 Gemini Awards .  ''[[The West Block '', a [[Sunday morning talk show|Sunday morning national political affairs show , debuted on November 6, 2011.<ref name=star>[https://www.thestar.com/news/article/1051766 ""CTV’s Question Period to face competition""]. ''[[Toronto Star '', September 9, 2011.</ref> Hosted by [[Tom Clark  journalist |Tom Clark  from 2011 to 2016, its current host is [[Mercedes Stephenson .  The investigative series ''[[16×9|16x9 '' as well as ''[[Global National|Global National Mandarin '' were both cancelled on June 28, 2016. ''Global National Mandarin'' aired its final broadcast on June 30, 2016.  ==Local programs== [[File:Global BC van.jpg|thumb|Global BC's live van   In the network's original form as an independent station based exclusively in Ontario, the original news anchors were [[Peter Trueman  and [[Peter Desbarats  who launched ''Global News'' in 1974.<ref name=global>[http://globalnews.ca/news/1143260/former-global-news-anchor-peter-desbarats-has-passed-away/ ""Former Global News anchor Peter Desbarats remembered as ‘first-class journalist’""]. Global News, February 12, 2014.</ref>   Until 1997, the name ''Global News'' was used only for the local newscasts on [[CIII-DT|Global Ontario , and Canwest's other local television stations all had different newscast titles.   With the nationwide launch of the ''Global'' brand in 1997, ''Global News'' was also adopted as a standard title for local newscasts on Global owned-and-operated stations. The long-dominant [[CHAN-DT|CHAN  Vancouver  BCTV  had been an exception; its news operation was renamed ''BCTV News on Global'' when it became a Global owned-and-operated in 2001, and its individual newscast titles  e.g. ''News Hour''  were also retained.  As part of a network-wide branding overhaul, local newscast titles and timeslots were standardized effective February 6, 2006, following the BCTV model. The exact lineup of newscasts and titles varied by station. The only station that did not follow the BCTV model is [[CHBC-TV|CHBC  Kelowna, which has kept its call sign as part of its news branding. As of 2011, [[CHBC-TV|CHBC  Kelowna have rebranded their news operations as ''Global News Okanagan''. In April 2016, Global once again rebranded its news programs national-wide dropping the BCTV model.   * ''[[Morning News  Canadian morning TV show |Global News Morning '': weekday and weekend mornings  previously known as ''Morning News''  ** Exceptions: ''[[The Morning Show  Canadian TV series |The Morning Show ''  Toronto  * ''[[News Hour  Canadian news program |Global News at Noon '': weekdays and weekends at noon  previously known as ''Noon News Hour''  ** Exceptions: ''Scene and Heard''  non-news regional lifestyle show on [[CISA-TV|CISA   * ''Global News at 5'': weekdays at 5:00 pm  previously known as ''Early News''  * ''[[News Hour  Canadian news program |Global News at 5:30 '': weekdays at 5:30 pm  [[CIII-DT|Toronto  and [[CKMI-DT|Montrea <nowiki/>l  * ''[[News Hour  Canadian news program |Global News Hour at 6 '': nightly at 6:00 pm  previously known as ''News Hour''   * ''Global News at 6:30'': weeknights at 6:30 pm  [[CHBC-DT|Okanagan   * ''[[News Hour  Canadian news program |Global News at 10 '' or ''[[News Hour  Canadian news program |Global News at 11 '': nightly at 10:00 pm  [[CKND-DT|Winnipeg , [[CFRE-DT|Regina , and [[CFSK-DT|Saskatoon   or 11:00 pm  previously known as ''News Hour Final'' or ''News Final''  * ''Focus'': Weekends  Regina/Saskatoon, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, BC   On October 4, 2007, Global's then-parent company [[Canwest  announced it would be centralizing [[Television studio#Production control room|news production control room  functions for all owned-and-operated stations  except [[CHBC-TV|CHBC  [[Kelowna   at four broadcast centres - [[CHAN-DT|CHAN  [[Vancouver , [[CITV-DT|CITV  [[Edmonton , [[CICT-DT|CICT  [[Calgary , and [[CIII-DT|CIII  [[Toronto . The company stated this would allow all of its stations to make a transition to high definition broadcasting, and create around 50 new jobs at the four stations. Approximately 250 positions were to be eliminated in the other stations, the majority of which were behind-the-scenes/technical positions.   A press release from the company has also stated that on-air talent  including weather anchors , reporters, producers, photographers, editors, and other news gathering positions will remain at the affected stations. Global Edmonton took over production of Global Maritimes' newscasts in mid-August 2008, and on September 4, 2008, took over production of all newscasts at [[CHCA-TV   the [[E!  Canadian TV system |E!  station in [[Red Deer, Alberta  . Global Calgary began production of Global Lethbridge's newscasts in mid-September, and later in the year Global BC took over CHEK Victoria, Global Regina, Global Saskatoon, Global Winnipeg and Global Montreal. In August 2009, production for Global News Montreal moved from Vancouver to Edmonton. The stations whose controls were taken over began using [[virtual set s. In September 2009, CHBC's controls were moved to Calgary  master control  and Vancouver  production control , and the station launched its own virtual set in July 2010.  On May 31, 2011, Shaw Media announced that new weekday local morning shows would be launched on Global Toronto, [[CKND-DT|Global Winnipeg , [[CFSK-DT|Global Saskatoon , [[CFRE-DT|Global Regina  and [[CIHF-DT|Global Maritimes  in late 2011. Local Sunday morning newscasts were also announced for Global Edmonton and Global Calgary, which launched in September 2011. The increase in news programming is part of a benefits package that Shaw Media has promised to fulfill as a condition to purchasing the network.<ref name=""PR110531"">[http://newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2011/31/c9068.html Global News redefines morning television in Toronto with The Morning Show featuring the return of Liza Fromer] , Global press release, May 31, 2011. Accessed online June 22, 2011.</ref>  On May 30, 2012, Shaw Media announced further expansions to Global's news programming offerings, with the launch of a new half-hour noon newscast on Global Toronto on August 27, and the expansion of primetime newscasts on Global Winnipeg, Global Saskatoon, Global Regina to one hour  and in turn, re-branding them from ''Prime News'' to ''News Hour Final''  on August 20. The previously announced weekday morning newscasts on Global Montreal and Global Maritimes were also confirmed to launch in fall 2012 on dates yet to be determined  their launches were later postponed to early 2013 . Local morning newscasts on Global BC, Global Edmonton and Global Calgary were also expanded, with the weekday morning newscasts on all three stations lengthened to four hours on August 27, and the Sunday morning news programs expanding to three hours starting September 2, 2012.  ''16:9'' was also moved from Saturdays to Friday nights, and Global News' website also received a redesign in early 2013 with compatibility for mobile devices in mind.  === Centralization === On April 9, 2015, Shaw announced cutbacks of Global's local news operations and a subsequent re-organization. Under these changes, which began to take effect in August 2015, production of late night and weekend newscasts in markets outside of Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, and Toronto, are centralized out of Global's studios in Toronto. Anchors and meteorologists are provided by the centralized news operation, while local stories are presented by the station's reporters.<ref name=faguy-faking></ref>   Local morning shows in these markets also switched to a hybrid local/national format with an eight-minute long national segment every half-hour. Local morning shows and evening newscasts otherwise continue to be produced locally. Troy Reeb, Global's senior vice president of news and station operations, explained that these changes would allow individual stations to devote more resources to the creation of local news content for television and digital platforms, and reduce redundancy in their coverage of national headlines. Reeb also explained that the changes were meant to allow staff reductions, whilst allowing the network to ""find innovative ways"" to distribute news content; at least 80 jobs were lost nationwide as part of the process.<ref name=global-2015changes></ref><ref name=gazette-globalchanges></ref>   In June 2015, Global announced that it had acquired Canadian rights to ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert ''. Late newscasts were kept at or shortened to 35 minutes in markets where ''The Late Show'' was to air in simulcast with [[CBS  at 11:35&nbsp;p.m. for [[simsub  purposes, including Halifax, Kelowna, Montreal, New Brunswick, Toronto, and Vancouver. Shaw had previously announced that it would extend its late newscasts in Halifax, Montreal, and New Brunswick to a full hour; to compensate for the change, Global Montreal instead introduced a half-hour noon newscast, and expanded its evening news to an hour. In markets with hour-long late newscasts, ''The Late Show'' is tape-delayed to air at the top of the hour instead.<ref name=gazette-mtlnews></ref><ref name=fagstein-lateshowchanges></ref>  ==News channels==  On January 11, 2012, [[Shaw Media  announced it had filed an application with the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission   CRTC  to launch a 24-hour Vancouver-based regional news network  to be licensed as a [[Category B services|Category B  [[digital cable  [[specialty channel  . The channel, tentatively named [[Global News: BC 1 ,<ref name=""bc-announce-july""></ref> will become the fourth regional news channel in Canada and the first located outside of Ontario, and will be operated by [[CHAN-DT|Global BC  and utilize its news staff. Proposed programming includes a primetime talk show hosted by Global BC senior reporter [[Jill Krop . Initially slated to launch in summer 2012, CRTC licensing delays have led the launch to be rescheduled for March 14, 2013.<ref name=""bc-announce-july"" />  On September 22, 2014, Shaw Media filed an application with the CRTC to launch a national news channel, to be branded as Global News 1.<ref name=news1>[http://business.financialpost.com/2014/07/04/shaw-media-seeking-to-launch-global-news-1-national-all-news-channel/?__lsa=7a52-cdc4 ""Shaw Media seeking to launch Global News 1 national all-news channel""]. ''[[Financial Post '', July 4, 2014.</ref> Billed as a ""hybrid"" local and national news channel, the service would broadcast news reports from Global's national news bureau and its local stations, and would open eight new newsrooms in underserved areas of Canada. The application is pending CRTC approval. According to a news release, Global News 1 was intended to launch in 2016 but there were no further updates on the channel after its initial announcement.  == Global News Radio == In 2017, Corus Radio began to re-brand [[news talk  and [[all-news  radio stations in major markets under the banner '''Global News Radio''' to create [[synergy|synergies  with its television news programming.  Current stations operating under the branding include: {| class=""wikitable"" |- ! Province || City !! Call Sign !!

CHQT carries the ""Global News Radio"" brand in Edmonton, and also airs simulcasts of Global News Hour at 6 and Global News at Noon from [[CITV-DT | Global Edmonton .  ==Criticism== While coverage of some breaking events has increased since the launch of ''Global National'', the network attracted controversy in 2003 when [[CKND-DT|CKND  in [[Winnipeg  aired its usual programming schedule on the night of the [[Manitoba general election, 2003|Manitoba provincial election  rather than providing any special news programming, and when CIII in Toronto bumped its [[Ontario general election, 2003|Ontario provincial election  coverage to then-sister station [[CHCH-DT|CHCH  in order to avoid preempting ''[[Survivor  US TV series |Survivor ''. Both stations aired full election night coverage in those provinces' 2007 elections.  In July 2010, ''Global National'' included video footage shot at another time and place into a segment about street demonstrations in Toronto. Correspondent Mike Drolet reported on a Toronto march held by groups demanding a public inquiry into police actions during a [[G20  conference. The report included clips of violence that erupted on Toronto streets during the event but Global added a scene shot months before in a Vancouver demonstration during the [[2010 Winter Olympics . After this was reported in Canadian blog Northern Insights, Global claimed this was an unintentional editing error.  ==References==   ==External links== *[http://www.globalnews.ca/ Global News] *[http://www.globalnational.com/ Global News - Global National]    [[Category:Global Television Network|   [[Category:Canadian television news programs  [[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1994  [[Category:1994 establishments in Canada ","Global News is the news and current affairs division of the Global Television Network in Canada, itself owned by Corus Entertainment, overseeing all of the network's national news programming as well as local news on its 15 owned-and-operated stations.

730,Y,nationalvanguard.org,"  '''National Vanguard''' is an American [[white nationalism|white nationalist , [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi  organization based in [[Charlottesville, Virginia , founded in 2005 by [[Kevin Alfred Strom  and former members of the [[National Alliance  United States |National Alliance .<ref name=spl_storm>  </ref>    ==History== The group was founded by former and expelled members of the [[National Alliance  United States |National Alliance . The National Alliance's 5-man Executive Committee, a think-tank created by [[Erich Gliebe  five months earlier to explore new ideas, issued a formal declaration called ""A Time for Leadership."" The declaration decried then-Chairman Erich Gliebe's dissolution of the National Alliance Board of Directors and his reducing of its composition to include merely himself and [[Chief operating officer|COO  [[Shaun Walker  white supremacist |Shaun Walker . It called for a reconstitution of the Board of Directors, and the merger of the Board with the Executive Committee in both membership and function. Gliebe and Walker rejected the declaration.  [[Image:Kevin alfred strom headcrop.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Kevin Alfred Strom, Founder and Managing Director of National Vanguard   In response, Gliebe and Walker claimed that Kevin Strom was not performing his job well as editor of the National Alliance's magazine, which was sometimes months late. There was a pay dispute where Kevin Strom claimed that Shaun Walker was not paying Strom his full salary, which became a public dispute within Internet chatrooms. This pay dispute and other internal conflicts created an atmosphere of factional personality conflicts which grew for 6 months until they erupted.  There were no legal options to take, so in April 2005 ""National Vanguard"" was formally organized by some former National Alliance Unit Coordinators and five members of the Executive Committee.  The main issues cited for the split with the National Alliance were over the creation of an expanded Board of Directors, prompt and professional publishing of a news-magazine and open accounting of all funds collected. The new organization picked Kevin Alfred Strom as its new leader, but a Board of Directors was not created. Within 8 months half of all National Vanguard members had either resigned or formed another new group. Most of the key leaders who planned the initial coup from the National Alliance group quit the National Vanguard within 15 months, but without all the open Internet airing of ""internal laundry."" In January 2007 Strom was arrested by the [[FBI  and [[United States Marshals Service|Federal Marshal s for [[child pornography  related charges. In 2008 he pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography  although he maintains that the possession was inadvertent  and was sentenced to 23 months in prison.<ref name=""DailyProgress2""></ref>  As of May 2015, National Vanguard maintains an active website featuring daily articles and updates.<ref name=spl_storm />  ==Activities==  Since the reorganization of National Vanguard, the group has been focused upon unit meetings and the distribution of fliers. A boycott against the hardware chain [[The Home Depot  was started because of its stance on illegal immigrants. Units in [[Florida , [[Nevada , and [[New Jersey  appear to be the most active. Members are attempting to form a new political party in Nevada: the White People's Party. One plank in the party's platform calls for ""the White Race"" to be placed on the [[Endangered Species Act|endangered species list  since ""all relevant laws are working against the continued existence of Whites.""  In the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina , which struck the U.S. Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005, a National Vanguard First Response Team was organized to help white families in [[Alabama  and [[Mississippi  on Sept. 20, 2005.

The [[News agency|agency  established its [[Recording studio|radio studio  and bureau in the city and at a [[News conference|press conference  on 10 August 2016 launched its [[Current affairs  news format |current affairs  and [[news program me, ''World in Focus''.<ref name="":1"" />  In March 2016, access to Sputnik's online content was blocked by Turkish authorities, as well as denying the Turkish bureau chief Tural Kerimov access to the country. The development is thought to have been in response to comments by the Russian leadership that were critical of President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan  regarding the Turkish administration's record on human rights and freedom of speech. The website was subsequently unblocked later that same year.  == Radio services == ''Radio Sputnik'' is the audio service of the Sputnik platform operating in 30 languages ""for a total of over 800 hours a day, covering over 130 cities and 34 countries on ""[[FM broadcasting|FM , [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB/DAB+   Digital Radio Broadcasting , [[HD Radio , as well as mobile phones and the Internet."" It is also available on various satellite transponders, including a 24 hour English service audible in North America via the Galaxy-19 satellite.

Regarding plans for the U.S. broadcast market, the editor-in-chief of ''Sputnik U.S.'' said in a June 2017 interview that there are no near-term plans for expansion into new markets beyond Washington, DC.<ref name=""dcist""> replaced discontinued dcist.com link </ref> This came on the heels of a late June 2017 announcement<ref name=""Sputnik1""></ref><ref name=""dcist""/><ref name=""TheHill""></ref> that Radio Sputnik would sublease [[Reston, Virginia -licensed [[Broadcast relay station#United States|translator station  ''W288BS''  105.5 FM  from Reston Translator, LLC, which transmits from the [[WIAD  tower in [[Bethesda, Maryland , and begin broadcasting Sputnik on that signal; the station's reach includes DC proper and the western suburbs in [[Northern Virginia .<ref name=""fccdataorg""></ref> Since November 2017, Radio Sputnik is also carried on AM in Washington on [[WZHF|WZHF 1390 AM . The American owners of the stations were required to register as a [[foreign agent  by the [[United States Department of Justice .  Sputnik cannot own an American radio station outright due to [[Federal Communications Commission  rules against foreign ownership of broadcast assets, as enacted in the [[Communications Act of 1934 . Prior to 1 July 2017, Radio Sputnik  initially as [[Voice of Russia|its predecessor   had broadcast in the Washington DC area on [[WTOP-FM|WTOP -HD2  103.5-HD2  since June 2013  if not earlier . W288BS translates [[Urban One 's [[WKYS   93.9 's digital [[HD Radio|HD3  signal for analog broadcasting.<ref name=""dcist""/>  == Criticism ==  ''[[Foreign Policy '' magazine has described Sputnik as a slick and internet-savvy outlet of [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin  propaganda, which ""remixes President [[Vladimir Putin 's brand of revanchist nationalism for an international audience... beating a predictable drum of anti-Western rhetoric.""<ref name=""foreignpolicy.com"" /> Such views were also voiced by the [[Washington DC -based [[think tank  [[Center for European Policy Analysis   CEPA , which argues that Sputnik spreads biased information. In the opinion of CEPA, Sputnik invites only a select group of commenting politicians, especially those known for their pro-Russian views.<ref name=""Sputnik. Propaganda in a New Orbit"" /> According to Kevin Rothrock, Russia editor for [[Global Voices Online|Global Voices , Sputnik ""acts as a spoiler to try and disrupt or blur information unfriendly to Russia, such as Russian troops' alleged [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine  2014–present |involvement in the war in Ukraine "". Historical comparisons have been made to ''[[Pravda '', once the official newspaper of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union , in particular Sputnik's alleged apologia for [[Joseph Stalin  and [[Denial of the Holodomor|denial of the 1932–1933 famine in Ukraine  known as the [[Holodomor .  German journalist and author Michael Thumann has described Sputnik as being part of what he calls Russia's ""digital [[information warfare|information war  against the West"".<ref name=""Zeit""></ref> [[Alexander Podrabinek , a Russian journalist who works for [[Radio France Internationale   part of [[Government of France|French Government 's [[France Médias Monde   and the [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Liberty <ref name=""RL""></ref>  supervised by [[Broadcasting Board of Governors , an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|Independent agency  of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Federal government   has accused Sputnik of disseminating Russian state propaganda abroad.<ref name=""AFPnov14""></ref> In a vote urging for the [[European Union  to ""respond to information warfare by Russia"", the [[European Parliament  accused broadcasting channels Sputnik and [[RT  TV channel |RT  of ""information warfare"", and placed Russian media organisations along terrorist organisations such as the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State . The federal agency of ''[[Rossotrudnichestvo '' and the [[Russkiy Mir Foundation  were also seen as tools for Russian [[propaganda  in this report. According to a study by [[Masaryk University , Sputnik is one of the major sources of Russian propaganda in the Czech Republic.  In October 2016, Sputnik misreported the contents of [[WikiLeaks  e-mails in a story that attacked [[Hillary Clinton . Quotes from an article produced by [[Kurt Eichenwald  were incorrectly attributed to [[Sidney Blumenthal   due to him quoting Eichenwald in an email  and taken out of context. Sputnik later took down the article.<ref name="":0""></ref> The false story was recited by the then-[[Republican Party  United States |Republican  nominee for [[President of the United States|president  [[Donald Trump  at one of his rallies, leading Eichenwald to accuse Trump of rebranding Russian propaganda for his own advantage. However, this has been disputed by ''[[The Washington Post '', stating that ""It's not that Trump is a [[Putin  [[wikt:marionette|marionette , it's that he seems to have pulled bad information off a questionable website and presented it on live television to an audience of thousands without skepticism. This is an indictment of his judgment, not of his loyalty.""<ref name=""WaPo Bump""></ref> Jon Passanto of [[BuzzFeed News  notes that the language used by Trump is more similar to a viral tweet from Twitter user @republic2016, which went out 4 hours before the Sputnik article appeared.<ref name=""WaPo Bump"" />  A January 2017 report by The Swedish Institute of International Affairs found that Swedish language version of Sputnik News was one of the main tools by which the Russian government spread false information in Sweden.<ref name="":5"" /><ref name="":6""></ref> According to the report, Sputnik News focused on highly negative stories about NATO and the EU, in particular.<ref name="":6"" />  In April 2017, [[Emmanuel Macron 's [[French presidential election, 2017|campaign team  banned both RT and Sputnik from campaign events. A Macron spokesperson said the two outlets showed a ""systematic desire to issue fake news and false information"".<ref name=""Emmanuel Macron’s campaign team bans Russian news outlets from events""></ref>  On 26 May 2017, journalist [[Andrew Feinberg  journalist |Andrew Feinberg , who had been Sputnik's White House Correspondent, announced on Twitter that he would no longer be reporting for the agency, citing pressure from Sputnik's Russian editors to write stories and ask questions at the White House that implied that murdered Democratic National Committee staffer [[Seth Rich  was killed in retaliation for leaking documents to WikiLeaks despite the lack of any evidence to support such a conclusion. In an interview with CNN's Brian Stelter, Feinberg also noted that Sputnik management had insisted on approving or dictating questions he would ask at White House press briefings, and wanted him to ask questions that implied that the April 2017 Sarin gas attack in Syria was a hoax, and that Sputnik tried to prevent reporters from having bylines to avoid accountability for falsehoods in stories.  In October 2017, [[Twitter  banned both RT and Sputnik from advertising on their social networking service amid accusations of [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections , prompting a stern response from the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs  Russia |Russian foreign ministry . It said the ban was a “gross violation” by the United States of the guarantees of free speech.“Retaliatory measures, naturally, will follow,” ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.<ref name=""Twitter Bans Ads From Russia Today and the Sputnik Network, Citing Election Meddling""></ref> In November, [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet  chairman [[Eric Schmidt  announced that [[Google  will be ""deranking"" stories from RT and Sputnik in response to allegations about election meddling by President Putin's government, provoking an angry response from both publications.<ref name=""Google to 'derank' Russia Today and Sputnik""></ref>  In April 2018, journalist [[John Stanton  journalist |John Stanton , who had been Sputnik's Pentagon Correspondent for roughly two years, published a report highly critical of Sputnik News, Sputnik Radio, and RIA Novosti, declaring that both the organizations were part of a larger Russian Information Warfare Operation. His public findings were part of an insider research effort while at Sputnik on behalf of the US government.  In May 2018, the [[PBS|Public Broadcasting System 's ''[[PBS NewsHour|NewsHour '' website published an article by [[Elizabeth Flock  journalist |Elizabeth Flock  who reported that after immersing herself for a week in Sputnik News and Radio reports she began ""questioning everything...What I found was a stranger picture than I anticipated, one in which I began to understand how persuasive disinformation could be."" According to the article, Stanton told her that ""'They mix real with unreal, use dubious sources...But trying to pin down what he really found problematic...was like pushing a wet noodle.' What he meant is that proving disinformation can be impossibly slippery.""

This compares with ''[[The Scottish Sun ''s audience in Scotland of 1.41 million and ''[[The Scotsman '' at 1.13 million. The Daily Record's print sales are dropping at a rate of over 20,000 a year. Its January 2010 circulation was 323,831. This has dropped to a January 2017 circulation of 155,772.  ==History== The ''Daily Record'' was founded in 1895. The ''North British Daily Mail'' ceased publication in 1901 and was then incorporated into the ''Daily Record'', which was renamed the ''Daily Record and Mail''. [[Lord Kemsley  bought the paper for £1&nbsp;million in 1922, forming a controlling company known as [[Associated Scottish Newspapers Limited . Production was transferred from Renfield Lane to 67 Hope Street in 1926. In 1971 the ''Daily Record'' became the first European newspaper to be printed with run-of-paper colour, and was the first British national to introduce computer page make-up technology. It was purchased by [[Trinity Mirror  in 1999, from the estate of [[Robert Maxwell .  ===Archive=== A Daily Record newspaper archives website expected to be launched in 2019 will the first edition in 1895 to most recent will be online.

The paper continues to support the Labour Party and has a close relationship with it, including donating £10,000 to the party in 2007. It opposes both the [[Scottish National Party   SNP  and [[Scottish independence . On the day of the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 Scottish Parliament election , it ran a front-page editorial attacking the SNP. Since Murray Foote became editor in February 2014, the publication's stance has become less clear cut.  For many years there has been a close relationship between ''Daily Record'' journalists and Labour Party politicians in Scotland, and a revolving door between newspaper staff and Labour advisers. [[Helen Liddell, Baroness Liddell of Coatdyke|Helen Liddell  went from being General Secretary of the Scottish Labour Party to being [[Robert Maxwell ’s Head of Corporate Affairs at the ''Daily Record''  1988-1991 .

Paul Sinclair was political editor of the ''Daily Record''  2000-2005 , before becoming a special advisor to [[Douglas Alexander , and then to [[Gordon Brown . He has been [[Johann Lamont 's special adviser and official spokesperson since 2011. Labour peer, and former MP and MSP, [[Michael Goodall Watson, Baron Watson of Invergowrie|Lord Watson of Invergowrie  has reflected that ‘the one paper no Labour MP or MSP can afford to ignore is the ''Daily Record'''.  The ''Daily Record'',  along with [[Brian Souter , spearheaded the ""''[[Keep the Clause campaign|Keep the Clause ''"" campaign which aimed to prevent the [[Scottish Parliament  from repealing [[Section 28 . This law prevented local authorities from promoting ""the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship"" in state schools.

It has been owned by [[Kalmbach Publishing  since 2010.  ==History==  ===Founding=== ''Discover'' was created primarily through the efforts of ''[[Time  magazine |Time '' magazine editor [[Leon Jaroff . He noticed that magazine sales jumped every time the cover featured a science topic. Jaroff interpreted this as a considerable public interest in science, and in 1971, he began agitating for the creation of a science-oriented magazine. This was difficult, as a former colleague noted, because ""Selling science to people who graduated to be managers was very difficult"".<ref name= Hevesi>Hevesi, Dennis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/business/media/leon-jaroff-editor-at-time-and-discover-magazines-dies-at-85.html ""Leon Jaroff, Editor at Time and Discover Magazines, Dies at 85""], ''The New York Times'', 21 October 2012</ref>  Jaroff's persistence finally paid off, and ''Discover'' magazine published its first edition in 1980. ''Discover'' was originally launched into a burgeoning market for science magazines aimed at educated non-professionals, intended to be easier to read than ''[[Scientific American '' but more detailed and science-oriented than ''[[Popular Science ''.<ref name=garfield>Garfield, Eugene. [http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v5p052y1981-82.pdf#search=%22discover%20buys%20science%20AAAS%22 ""Introducing Discover""], ''Essays of an Information Scientist'', Vol:5, 16 March 1981, pp. 52-56</ref> Shortly after its launch, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science   AAAS  launched a similar magazine called ''[[Science  1979–1986 magazine |Science 80 ''  not to be confused with its flagship [[Science  journal |academic journal  , and both ''[[Science News '' and ''[[Science Digest '' changed their formats to follow the new trend.  During this period, ''Discover'' featured fairly in-depth science reporting on ""hard science"" and avoided fringe topics like [[extraterrestrial intelligence . Most issues contained an essay by a well-known scientist—such as [[Stephen Jay Gould , [[Jared Diamond , and [[Stephen Hawking . Another common article was a biography, often linked with mentions of other scientists working in the field. The ""Skeptical Eye"" column sought to uncover [[popular science|pop-science  scams, and was the medium where [[James Randi  released the results of [[Project Alpha . Jaroff said that it was the most-read section at its launch.<ref name=garfield/>  ===Competition and change=== The sudden appearance of so many magazines in the same market space inevitably led to some falling by the wayside, and ''Discover'' was left largely alone in its market space by the mid-1980s, it nevertheless decided to appeal to a wider audience, by including articles on [[psychology  and [[psychiatry . Jaroff told the editor-in-chief that these were not ""solid sciences"", and was sent back to ''Discover'''s parent, [[Time Inc.|Time, Inc . ""Skeptical Eye"" and other columns disappeared, and articles covered more controversial, speculative topics  like ""How the Universe Will End"" . The new format was a great success, and the new format remained largely unchanged for the next two decades.  Gilbert Rogin, a ''Sports Illustrated'' editor, was brought in 1985 to revive ''Discover''. In 1986, Time purchased the subscription lists of the shuttered magazines ''[[Science Digest '' and ''[[Science  1979–1986 magazine |Science 86 '' from their publishers. Circulation for the magazine reached 925,000 by May 1987 with revenue for 1986 being $6.9 million., but annual net loss were $10 million per year.   In January 1987, Time appointed a new ''Discover'' publisher, Bruce A. Barnet, previously publisher of ''Picture Week'' test magazine from August 1985 to replace James B. Hayes, who was appointed publisher of ''[[Fortune  magazine |Fortune ''.  The magazine changed hands several times. In 1987, Time, Inc. sold ''Discover'' to Family Media, the owners of ''[[Health  magazine |Health '', ''Golf Illustrated'', ''Homeowner'', ''1,001 Home Ideas'' and ''World Tennis'', for $26 million. From January to July 1991, Discover magazine lost 15% of its advertising while still remaining profitable. Family Media closed down while suspending publication of all its magazines and place them up for sale. Family Media's last ''Discover'' issue was August 1991, with a circulation of 1.1 million copies.<ref name=lat></ref>  In September 1991, [[The Walt Disney Company  bought the magazine for its [[Disney Publishing Worldwide|Disney Publishing 's Magazine Group. The magazine's main office was moved to the Magazine Group office in Burbank while leaving one third behind in New York in a small editorial and advertising office. Disney was able to retain Family Media's editor-in-chief for the magazine, Paul Hoffman.<ref name=lat/> Disney increased the magazine's photography  doubled  and its content budget to over come skipping 2 issues in Family Media's shutdown and ownership change. In 1993, Disney Magazine Publishing Inc. decided to launch a trade advertising campaign designed with advertising firm Ziff Marketing to raise awareness in the advertising field that the magazine is an accessible general interest magazine in the science category.  In October 2005, [[Bob Guccione, Jr. , founder of ''[[Spin magazine|Spin '' and ''[[Gear  magazine |Gear '' magazines, and some [[private equity  partners purchased the magazine from Disney. Guccione served as CEO and oversaw a redesign for the April 2006 issue. However, Guccione was ousted as CEO in October 2007 in what was described as ""a falling-out over philosophical differences with his financial backers"". Henry Donahue, Discover Media's chief financial officer, became the new CEO. In 2008, he also assumed the role of publisher. In October 2008, Corey Powell, ''Discover''’s executive editor, became editor-in-chief.<ref name=""new staff in wisconsin""></ref> As of April 2009, the magazine published combined issues in January/February and July/August, for a total of ten issues a year.

Pearson  and [[Mangesh Hattikudur  while they were students at [[Duke University . According to the Mental Floss website, the idea came from conversations in the Duke cafeteria about the need for an entertaining educational magazine. According to Hattikudur, they wanted to ""distill some of the best lectures from our favorite college professors. We thought if we could bottle their enthusiasm and deliver it in monthly installments, it'd be great.""<ref name=""auto""/>  Later, Pearson met with president of Duke University, who loved the idea, but disliked the name. The first published issue, known as the ""Campus Edition"", was published in spring 2000, distributing 3,000 issues.  The founders spent much of their first year looking for investors and staff members while raising funds to publish the first issue, which was released in May 2001.

It started as a Facebook page named MovePH in August 2011 and later evolved into a complete website on January 1, 2012.<ref name=""aboutrappler""></ref> Along with web based text news content, it was also among the first news websites in the Philippines to extensively use online multimedia including video, pictures, text and audio. It also uses social media sites for news distribution.<ref name=""ftrappler""></ref>  According to its own website, the name Rappler is a [[portmanteau  of the words ""rap""  to discuss  and ""ripple""  [[ripple effect|to make waves  .<ref name=aboutrappler/>  In 2018, it was the recipient of legal proceedings from arms of the Philippine government. Rappler and its staff said it was being targeted for its revelations of misappropriations by government and elected officials.<ref name=""arrest""></ref>  ==History== With the idea of professional journalists using social media and crowd sourcing for news distribution, Rappler was started in 2011 by Filipino journalist [[Maria Ressa  along with her entrepreneur and journalist friends. Brainstorming for the company began some time in 2010 when Maria Ressa was writing her second book ""From Bin Laden to Facebook."" Other key people involved in its conceptualization and creation were former [[Newsbreak  magazine |Newsbreak  head and [[ABS-CBN News Channel  managing editor Glenda Gloria, journalist and [[Ateneo De Manila University  professor Chay Hofileña, former ''[[TV Patrol '' executive producer Lilibeth Frondoso, Philippine internet pioneer [[Nix Nolledo , internet entrepreneur Manuel I. Ayala and former [[Nation Broadcasting Corporation  executive Raymund Miranda.       Rappler first went public as a [[beta version  website on January 1, 2012, the same day that the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer '' published a Rappler piece that broke out the story of  then  Philippine Chief Justice [[Renato Corona  being awarded a [[University of Santo Tomas  doctoral degree without a required dissertation. The site officially launched at its #MoveManila event at the [[Far Eastern University  in Manila on January 12, 2012.  ==Coverage of fake news campaigns in the Philippines==  In 2016, Rappler began to be critical of the [[Rodrigo Duterte presidential campaign, 2016|Duterte  led government of the Philippines, who had just taken office in 2016 and his controversial [[Philippine Drug War|war on drugs  after it noticed a trend of [[fake news  related to him in media outlets of the state and private entities, and being spread on [[facebook .<ref name=""pbs""></ref> On 11 January 2018, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission  Philippines |Securities and Exchange Commission  revoked Rappler's license to operate as a ""mass media"" entity, for allegedly violating the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution's  Foreign Equity Restrictions in Mass Media by being wholly foreign-owned.<ref name=SECruling></ref> Rappler then sought a petition for review from the [[Court of Appeals of the Philippines|Court of Appeals  on 28 January,<ref name=Rapplerappeal></ref> but was rejected on 26 July 2018, finding no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the SEC. Many journalistic organizations and committees saw the act as intimidation and attempt to silence the opposition, and control freedom of the press.<ref name=CAaffirms></ref>  On October 26, 2017, Rappler became a member of the [[Poynter Institute 's International Fact-Checking Network  IFCN . This led to [[Facebook  tapping Rappler and [[Vera Files  in April 2018 to be its Philippine partners in its worldwide fact-checking program, in part because of their participation in the IFCN.<ref name="":2""></ref><ref name="":3""></ref> Under the program, false news stories will appear lower on users' news feeds and lower the chances of people seeing those stories.<ref name="":2"" /><ref name="":3"" /> The program, according to a Facebook executive, ""is one of the ways we hope to better identify and reduce the reach of false news that people share on our platform.""<ref name="":3"" /> A spokesperson for the Philippine government backed the fact-checking program but protested Facebook's partnership with Rappler.  ===2018 ownership controversy and revocation of certificate of incorporation===  On January 11, 2018, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission  Philippines |Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines   SEC  revoked Rappler's certificate of incorporation over Rappler's use of Philippine [[Depositary receipt|Depository Receipts   PDRs . It said that the provisions of the PDR issued to [[Omidyar Network  by Rappler gave the American investment firm control over the local media firms' other PDR holders as well as its corporate policies, which the SEC says is a violation of the Constitution's provisions on foreign ownership and control.<ref name=SECruling /> Rappler claimed that it was 100% Filipino owned and that Omidyar only invests in the media firm. Despite the certificate revocation, SEC stated that Rappler could still operate since their decision was not final, pointing out that the media firm could also challenge the decision before the Court of Appeals within 15 days. Malacañang Palace also suggested that Rappler authors can still continue to publish on their website as bloggers.<ref name=""bebloggersnalang""></ref> On February 28, [[Omidyar Network  donated its Rappler PDRs to the editors and executives of Rappler.  Rappler stated that the revocation of Rappler's certificate was an attack against the [[freedom of press|freedom of the press .<ref name="":0""></ref> The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines  NUJP , Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines  FOCAP  and the Philippine Press Institute  PPI  said the SEC ruling is part of a pattern of restricting criticism.<ref name="":0"" /> The National Press Club of the Philippines, on the other hand, supported the SEC decision.<ref name="":4""></ref>  Members of the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives issued statements of concern, describing the SEC revocation of Rappler's license as ""a loss for dissenting voices and free speech,""<ref name="":5""></ref> ""pure harassment"" and ""straight out of the dictator’s playbook,""<ref name="":6""></ref><ref name="":5"" /> and an ""affront on press freedom.""<ref name="":6"" /> A Law advocacy group called ""CenterLaw"" said the move was unconstitutional since the SEC denied Rappler due process. It also said the SEC's action was ""tantamount to prior restraint"" of ""a known critic of the government’s drug war.""  The Philippine government issued a statement denying such a claim, pointing out that President [[Rodrigo Duterte  could have used the armed forces to implement Rappler's closure, as done by various foreign governments, but had not resorted to such moves.<ref name=""nocensorship""></ref> The chief presidential legal counsel defended the SEC, saying the SEC's job was simply to punish violators of the law.  A [[BBC News  report described wider concerns about the media in the Philippines, citing how a major campaign donor of the Philippine president had earlier become majority shareholder of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, a newspaper critical of the government’s war on drugs.<ref name="":5"" /> The [[Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism  and the [[Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility  also cited verbal attacks by the Philippine president and close allies on media organizations that have released critical reports on the government.<ref name="":4"" /> The [[National Bureau of Investigation  Philippines |National Bureau of Investigation  of the Philippines subpoenaed Ressa and a former Rappler reporter on January 18, 2018, in connection with an online libel complaint filed by private entrepreneur Wilfredo Keng.

For many years until a major redesign in the 1970s, ''Newsday'' copied the ''Daily News'' format of short stories and lots of pictures  Ironically, Patterson was fired as a writer at her father's ''Daily News'' in her early 20s, after getting the basic facts of a divorce wrong in a published report . After Patterson's death in 1963, Guggenheim became publisher and editor.  In 1967, Guggenheim turned over the publisher position to [[Bill Moyers  and continued as president and editor-in-chief. But Guggenheim was disappointed by the liberal drift of the newspaper under Moyers, criticizing what he called the ""left-wing"" coverage of Vietnam War protests.<ref name=""time42770""></ref><ref name=""keeler""></ref>  The two split over the 1968 presidential election, with Guggenheim signing an editorial supporting [[Richard Nixon , when Moyers supported [[Hubert Humphrey .  Guggenheim sold his majority share to the then-conservative [[Times-Mirror Company  over the attempt of newspaper employees to block the sale, even though Moyers offered $10 million more than the Times-Mirror purchase price; Moyers resigned a few days later.<ref name=""time42770""/><ref name=""nyt51370""></ref><ref name=""raymont313""></ref>  Guggenheim, who died a year later, disinherited Moyers from his will.  After the competing ''[[Long Island Press ''  not to be confused with the alternative weekly of the same name  ceased publication in 1977, ''Newsday'' launched a separate [[Queens, New York City|Queens  edition, followed by a New York City edition dubbed ''New York Newsday''. In June 2000, Times Mirror merged with the [[Tribune Company , partnering ''Newsday'' with the New York City television station [[WPIX   Channel 11 , also owned by Tribune.  With the Times Mirror-Tribune merger, the newspaper founded by [[Alicia Patterson  was now owned by the company that was founded by her great-grandfather, [[Joseph Medill  — which owns the ''[[Chicago Tribune '' and, until 1991, also owned her father's ''Daily News''.  Tribune sold the ''Daily News'' to British newspaper magnate [[Robert Maxwell . After Maxwell's death in 1992, his publishing empire collapsed and [[Mortimer Zuckerman  purchased the ''Daily News''.  [[Chicago, Illinois , real estate magnate [[Samuel Zell  purchased Tribune in 2007.<ref name=nyt />  [[News Corporation , headed by CEO [[Rupert Murdoch , attempted to purchase ''Newsday'' for US$580 million in April 2008. This was soon followed by a matching bid from Zuckerman and a $680 million bid from [[Cablevision . In May 2008, News Corporation withdrew its bid, and on May 12, 2008, ''Newsday'' reported that Cablevision would purchase the paper for $650 million. The sale was completed July 29, 2008.  [[Altice  company |Altice , a [[Netherlands -based multinational telecoms company, bought Cablevision, including Newsday and News 12 in 2016. However, Altice then sold a majority  75%  stake in Newsday back to Cablevision's former owner [[Charles Dolan  and his son Patrick, making Patrick the CEO of Newsday``. Altice disposed of its remaining stake in Newsday at the end of July 2018, which, combined with Charles Dolan's transfer of shares to son Patrick, makes Patrick the sole owner of Newsday.  ==Editorial style== Despite having a [[tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid  format, ''Newsday'' is not known for being sensationalistic, as are other local daily tabloids, such as the New York ''[[Daily News  New York |Daily News '' and the ''[[New York Post ''.  In 2004, the alternative weekly newspaper ''[[Long Island Press ''  which is not related to the defunct daily of the same name  wrote that ''Newsday'' has used its clout to influence local politics in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau  and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk  Counties.  [[Bill Moyers  briefly served as publisher. During the tenure of publisher [[Robert M. Johnson  in the 1980s, Newsday made a major push into New York City. The paper's roster of columnists and critics has included [[Cathy Young , [[Jimmy Breslin , [[Barbara Garson , [[Normand Poirier , [[Murray Kempton , [[Gail Collins  journalist |Gail Collins , [[Pete Hamill , [[Sydney Schanberg , [[Robert Reno   died 2012 , [[Jim Dwyer  journalist |Jim Dwyer , sportswriter [[Mike Lupica , music critic [[Tim Page  music critic |Tim Page , and television critic [[Marvin Kitman . The paper featured both [[advice column ists [[Ann Landers  and [[Dear Abby  for several years.  From 1985 to 2005, Michael Mandelbaum wrote a regular foreign affairs analysis column for Newsday. Noted writer and biographer [[Robert Caro  was an investigative reporter. Its features section has included, among others, television [[reporter s [[Verne Gay  and [[Diane Werts , TV/film feature writer [[Frank Lovece , and film critic [[Rafer Guzman . Newsday carries the syndicated columnist [[Froma Harrop . [[Pulitzer Prize  winner [[Walt Handelsman 's editorial political cartoons animation are a nationally syndicated feature of Newsday. In the 1980s, a new design director, Robert Eisner, guided the transition into digital design and color printing.   ''Newsday'' created and sponsored a ""Long Island at the Crossroads"" advisory board in 1978, to recommend regional goals, supervise local government, and liaison with state and Federal officials. It lasted approximately a decade.  On March 21, 2011, ''Newsday'' redesigned its front page, scrapping the [[nameplate  publishing |nameplate  and font used since the 1960s in favor of a sans-serif wordmark.  ==Circulation== In 2008, ''Newsday'' was ranked 10th in terms of newspaper circulation in the United States.<ref name=nyt />  A circulation scandal in 2004 revealed that the paper's daily and Sunday circulation had been inflated by 16.9% and 14.5%, respectively, in the auditing period September 30, 2002 to September 30, 2003.<ref name=abc2>[http://www.accessabc.com/press/press111604.htm Audit Bureau of Circulation, ""ABC Releases ''Newsday'' Audit"", November 16, 2004]</ref> The Audit Bureau of Circulation adjusted average weekday circulation to 481,816 from 579,599; average Saturday circulation to 392,649 from 416,830; and average Sunday circulation to 574,081 from 671,820, and instituted twice-yearly audits.<ref name=abc2 />   On October 28, 2009, ''Newsday'' changed its web site to a [[Pay wall|paid-subscriber only model . Newsday.com would open its front page, classified ads, movie listings, and school closings to all site visitors, but access beyond this content would require a weekly fee – US$5 as of 2010.

He responded to the comments from the News International with the following statement: <blockquote> ""We deliver you traffic and drive you revenues you otherwise wouldn't have received. The idea that we are undermining your businesses is incorrect. It is fanciful to imagine that, if it weren't for link aggregators, you would have more traffic or revenues. We provide a service that you do not: a means for readers to find your content more readily, via continuously updating links to a diversity of websites."" </blockquote> There has also been interest from the UK's [[Newspaper Licensing Agency  regarding the use of news headlines search results, which they consider to be copyrighted content.  ==Infrastructure== Newsnow can be accessed via the following domain names: ''newsnow.co.uk'', ''newsnow.org'', ''newsnow.net'' and ''newsnow.com'' domain name.  ==References== <references/>       [[Category:News aggregators ","NewsNow is a news aggregator service that was launched in 1998 with fewer than ten sources, it now links to thousands of publications including top news providers.

In 1989, in response to the increasing marginalization of the Yiddish language in the changing Jewish community, ''Der Algemeiner Journal'' began printing a four-page English supplement in the middle of the paper, attracting a wider and more diverse Jewish audience.   In May 2005, after Gershon Jacobson's passing, his elder son, [[Simon Jacobson , became the Publisher of ''Der Algemeiner Journal''. He founded the Gershon Jacobson Jewish Continuity Foundation  GJCF , a Jewish media organization with the mission to serve as a voice for Jews and Israel. In 2008, he reconceived ''Der Algemeiner Journal'' as an English-language publication, replacing the Yiddish ""Der"" in its title for ""The"". That year, Dovid Efune became the Editor-In-Chief of what was called ''The Algemeiner'' and Director of the GJCF.  In 2011, the GJCF launched the website Algemeiner.com.

The vast majority of ''The Algemeiner'' readership and content is online.  ==Annual events and lists== Since 2006, in conjunction with the Gershon Jacobson Foundation, ''The Algemeiner'' hosts an annual lecture series featuring a politician, Jewish leader or scholar. In 2011, Connecticut Senator [[Joseph Lieberman  spoke on politics and religion.  Beginning in 2010, ''The Algemeiner'' has put out an annual list of non-Jews who have had a positive influence in shaping the Jewish future. Media mogul [[Rupert Murdoch  was named first in 2010, Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper  in 2011, [[Mitt Romney  in 2012, and [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi  in 2013.  As a prelude to the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|2012 Republican primaries , ''The Algemeiner'' ranked the party's eight candidates by assessing their positive effect on Israel. [[Rick Santorum , [[Michele Bachmann  and [[Newt Gingrich  were viewed as the three best candidates for Israel, while [[Ron Paul  was viewed as the least beneficial.

In a candidates' debate, he described the campaign process to prospective voters:  </ref>   Kimball used this philosophy to found Vote Smart in 1992.<ref name=""Stateman""/> His founding board included Presidents [[Jimmy Carter   D  and [[Gerald Ford   R , plus Republican U.S. Senator [[Barry Goldwater  and Democratic U.S. Senators [[George McGovern  and [[William Proxmire  as well as other nationally known figures.<ref name=Stateman/>  Originally based at [[Oregon State University  in Corvallis, Oregon, PVS established its headquarters and research center in 1999 at the Great Divide Ranch near [[Philipsburg, Montana . In 2006, Vote Smart added a branch at The [[University of Arizona  in Tucson, Arizona. Coincident with this move, Vote Smart gave its president Richard Kimball a pay increase that was criticized by some alumni and contributed to a reduction in its [[Charity Navigator  score. In December 2010, the Tucson office was closed in preparation for two new satellite research offices. The reason for the closure of the Tucson branch was also related to the university's budget cuts, which eliminated Vote Smart's ""rent-free space at a 1,500- square-foot house off the main campus.""   In January 2011, Vote Smart moved its Key Votes Department and Political Courage Test Department to facilities offered by both the [[University of Texas-Austin  and the [[University of Southern California . Vote Smart has since left the University of Southern California and moved its Political Courage Department to its Montana research center.  In March 2014, Vote Smart laid off six employees, citing financial difficulties. A seventh employee quit because of the sudden layoffs.  In August 2016, Vote Smart announced that it would be selling its 150-acre ranch near Philipsburg, Montana, and relocating its headquarters after the November 2016 U.S. presidential election. Kimball said the ranch's secluded location, which housed 40 interns, had caused issues: ""We have all the problems a university does with the experimental, adventurous, hormonal torrent that is the young. Only in the wilderness such things can become dangerous. Love was requited and denied, marriages were created, fights ensued, drinkers crashed, injuries of every sort, hospital trips too numerous to recall, some to sustain life, and distressingly, three deaths."" [[Drake University  in [[Des Moines, Iowa  was later announced as the new headquarters.  ==Funding== Vote Smart says that it does not accept contributions from [[corporations , [[labor unions , [[political parties , or other organizations that lobby, support or oppose candidates or issues. Donors to the organization have included the [[Ford Foundation , the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York , and the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation .  Individual contributors are considered members, and are given the opportunity to visit their headquarters at the Great Divide Ranch where they work as research volunteers alongside interns and staff.  == Political Courage Test ==  The Political Courage Test  formerly the National Political Awareness Test, NPAT  is an [[United States|American  initiative intended to increase transparency in [[Politics of the United States|American politics .  It is part of the voter education organization Vote Smart's candidate information program. With a view towards elections, the test seeks to obtain answers from election candidates, describing their respective stances on a variety of popular issues in American politics. This information is then made available to voters in a selection-driven, standardized format.  In 2008, Project Vote Smart kicked [[John McCain  off of the organization's board due to his refusal to fill out the Political Courage Test.  The response to the Political Courage Test has dropped, from 72% in 1996 to 48% in 2008, because politicians from both parties are afraid that challengers will use their responses out of context in attack ads, according to ''[[The Wall Street Journal ''.  Rep. Anne Gannon, Democratic leader pro tempore of the [[Florida House of Representatives , stated: ""We tell our candidates not to do it. It sets them up for a hit piece."" In response, Vote Smart has tried to shame politicians into it, and lets them leave up to 30% of answers blank.<ref name=""waryofsurveys""></ref>  ==VoteEasy==  VoteEasy is ""the interactive tool that enables voters to compare their position on various issues with that of a candidate.""  It was introduced by Vote Smart during the 2010 election season.  Following its launch, VoteEasy was a topic of interest among several national news organizations including [[CBS News , ''[[The New York Times '', and the ''[[Christian Science Monitor ''.  ==See also== *[[Center for Responsive Politics  *[[On the Issues   ==References==   ==External links== *  [[Category:1992 establishments in Oregon  [[Category:Election and voting-related organizations based in the United States  [[Category:Government watchdog groups in the United States  [[Category:Non-profit organizations based in Iowa  [[Category:Organizations established in 1992 ","Vote Smart, formerly called Project Vote Smart, is a non-profit, non-partisan research organization that collects and distributes information on candidates for public office in the United States.

In July 2014, ''The Intercept'' obtained leaked documents revealing that the [[Obama  administration approved a major expansion of the [[Terrorist Screening Database|terrorist watchlist system , authorizing a secret process that required neither ""concrete facts"" nor ""irrefutable evidence"" to designate an American or foreigner as a terrorist.<ref name=rules></ref> In August 2014, ''The Intercept'' reported that nearly half of the people on the U.S. government's widely shared database of terrorist suspects were not connected to any known terrorist group.<ref name=watch></ref> The watchlist reports prompted intelligence officials to consider requesting a criminal investigation into ''The Intercept'' sources.<ref name=criminvest></ref> In October 2014, it was reported that the FBI had raided the home of the suspected source in northern Virginia, outside Washington, D.C.<ref name=raid></ref>  In December 2014, ''The Intercept'' published new leaked documents from [[Edward Snowden  showing that British surveillance agency [[Government Communications Headquarters  was behind an attack, codenamed [[Operation Socialist , on [[Proximus Group|Belgacom 's systems  Belgium's largest telecom . The attack was described by Snowden as the ""first documented example to show one EU member state mounting a cyber attack on another.""  In April 2015, ''The Intercept'' reported in collaboration with ''[[Der Spiegel '' that a U.S. military base in [[Ramstein Air Base|Ramstein , Germany, serves as the ""high-tech heart"" of America's drone program. Ramstein is the site of a satellite relay station that enables drone operators in the American southwest to communicate with their remote aircraft in Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan, and other targeted countries. ''The Intercept'' cited a top-secret document and a confidential source, who said that ""Ramstein carries the signal to tell the drone what to do and it returns the display of what the drone sees. Without Ramstein, drones could not function, at least not as they do now.""<ref name=ramstein></ref>  In September 2015, ''The Intercept'' disclosed dozens of top-secret British intelligence documents, which revealed that spy agency [[Government Communications Headquarters   GCHQ  was trying to build a surveillance system to monitor ""every visible user on the internet"". It reported that GCHQ was developing new techniques to perform ""population-scale"" data mining, monitoring all communications across entire countries in an effort to detect patterns or behaviors deemed suspicious.<ref name=karma></ref>  In October 2015, ''The Intercept'' published the [[Drone Papers , a series of stories based on a cache of leaked secret documents detailing the inner workings of the [[Disposition Matrix|U.S. military's assassination program  in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia. The news site said that the documents were ""provided by a whistleblower"" and offered ""an unprecedented glimpse into Obama's drone wars"".<ref name=""dpapers""></ref> The revelations were praised by [[Pentagon Papers  [[whistleblower , Daniel Ellsberg, and NSA leaker, [[Edward Snowden , who said: ""When we look back on today, we will find the most important national security story of the year.""<ref name=""ellsberg""></ref> [[Micah Zenko , a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, described the Drone Papers reports as ""pretty remarkable stuff."" He added: ""In some ways it reconfirms and illuminates much of what we knew, or thought we knew, about a lot of these programs, like that the administration firmly prefers kill over capture despite claiming the opposite, and that there's not 'a bunch of folks in the room', as Obama calls it – that there's a clear, bureaucratic process for this. It clearly shows, as we've known, that the United States does not know who it's killing.""<ref name=""ellsberg"" /> The White House and [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council  declined to comment, saying in a statement that it does not ""comment on the details of classified reports.""<ref name=""ellsberg"" />  In November 2016, ''The Intercept'' revealed that a windowless skyscraper in New York City's Lower Manhattan, owned by [[AT&T , hosts a secret [[National Security Agency  surveillance site ""that is used to tap into phone calls, faxes, and internet data.""  On January 10, 2017, ''The Intercept'' reported that members of elite U.S. military unit, [[SEAL Team Six , had committed potential war crimes, including mutilating corpses and attempted beheadings. Senior command staff were aware of the misconduct, but did little to stop it, and in some cases helped to cover up the wrongdoing, according to the report.  On January 31, 2017, ''The Intercept'' published leaked documents from the FBI, revealing that the bureau can use ""national security letters"" to spy on journalists without the previously necessary step of obtaining permission from a judge. Trevor Timm, executive director of the [[Freedom of the Press Foundation , said the rules were ""incredibly weak and almost nonexistent."" The documents also showed that the FBI uses the threat of deportation to turn immigrants into confidential informants.  In June 2017, ''The Intercept'' released a top-secret document leaked from NSA, which revealed information about hacking efforts by [[Main Intelligence Directorate|Russian military intelligence  against several U.S. state and local government agencies during the [[2016 United States elections .<ref name=""The Intercept""></ref>  ==Awards== In February 2016, ''The Intercept'' won a [[National Magazine Award  for columns and commentary by the writer [[Barrett Brown , and it was a finalist in the public interest category for a series by Sharon Lerner called the Teflon Toxin, which exposed how [[DuPont  harmed the public and its workers with toxic chemicals. In April 2016, ''The Intercept'' won the People's Voice award for best news website at the twentieth annual [[Webby Awards . In May 2016, ''The Intercept'' won three awards at the New York Press Club Awards For Journalism. The site was awarded in the ""special event reporting"" category for its investigative reporting on the U.S. drone program, the ""humor"" category for a series of columns by the writer [[Barrett Brown , and the ""documentary"" category for a short film called, ""The Surrender""—about the former U.S. intelligence analyst [[Stephen Jin-Woo Kim —produced by Stephen Maing, [[Laura Poitras , and Peter Maass. At the September 2016 Online News Awards, ''The Intercept'' won the University of Florida Award in Investigative Data Journalism for its [[Drone Papers  series, an investigation of secret documents detailing a covert U.S. military overseas assassination program.  At the 2017 Online News Awards, ''The Intercept'' won two awards: the first for a feature story about the FBI's efforts to infiltrate the [[Bundy family , and the second, an investigative data journalism award for ""Trial and Terror,"" a project documenting the people prosecuted in the U.S. for terrorism since 9/11. The same year, ''The Intercept'' won a Hillman Prize for Web Journalism for an investigative series by Jamie Kalven exposing criminality within the Chicago Police Department. The news organization also won a 2017 award for ""Outstanding Feature Story"" at the sixteenth annual Awards for Reporting on The Environment.<ref name=""auto""></ref> Judges of the environmental award praised author Sharon Lerner for her piece ""The Strange Case of Tennie White,"" which they described as a ""finely written and disturbing investigation of contamination and injustice near a chemical plant in Mississippi.""<ref name=""auto""/>  ==U.S. government reaction== On August 15, 2014, U.S. [[Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive|National Counterintelligence Executive   NCE  [[William Evanina  confirmed that the [[FBI  is moving forward with a probe into how classified documents were leaked to ''The Intercept'' for its article revealing details about a database of terrorism suspects, which linked some people to terrorism even if they had no known association with any terrorism group. ""It's a criminal act that has us very concerned,"" said Evanina, a former FBI special agent with a counter-terrorism specialty who was appointed NCE by [[Director of National Intelligence  [[James R. Clapper  in May 2014.  In August 2014, it was reported that members of the U.S. military had been banned from reading ''The Intercept''.  ==Criticism and controversy== [[Erik Wemple , writing for ''The Washington Post'', noted the conspicuous refusal of ''The Intercept'' to use the term ""[[targeted killing s"" to refer to the U.S. drone program, instead referring to the drone strikes as ""assassinations."" Wemple included Greenwald's explanation that [[assassination  is ""the accurate term rather than the [[euphemism|euphemistic  term that the government wants us to use""; Greenwald further noted that ""anyone who is murdered deliberately away from a battlefield for political purposes is being assassinated.""<ref name=wemple></ref> [[TechCrunch  referred to the story as clear evidence of ""unabashed opposition to security [[War hawk#Variations of the term|hawks .""<ref name=techcrunch></ref>  In January 2015, Benjamin Wittes, editor in chief of ''[[Lawfare  blog |Lawfare '', argued that essentially, ''The Intercept'' was inviting individuals and organizations to steal documents and leak them to ''The Intercept'' by publishing a ""How to Leak to the Intercept"" guide.<ref name="":0""></ref> Wittes wrote,<blockquote>If I were a foreign intelligence agency, I'd be looking at this as a great way to send enticing-looking documents, maybe even real ones, that contain some nifty bits of executable code that offered visibility for me onto the activities of people with access to the Snowden materials, people who are talking to and recruiting other leakers. Or maybe I'd be drop some honey-pot files, some files that beacon their location. Or maybe I'd just use the opportunity to drop disinformation on journalists who have shown they will believe just about anything if it's disparaging of U.S. intelligence.<ref name="":0"" /></blockquote> Wittes also questioned the ability of ''The Intercept'' to protect those who leak to the online publication.<ref name="":0"" />  ===Juan M. Thompson scandal===   In February 2016, the site appended lengthy corrections to five stories by reporter Juan M. Thompson and retracted a sixth, about [[Charleston church shooting|Charleston church shooter  [[Dylann Roof , written over the previous year, focused on the [[African Americans|African-American  community. Shortly afterward, a note from editor Betsy Reed indicated that Thompson had been fired recently after his editors discovered ""a pattern of deception"" in his reporting. According to Reed, he had ""fabricated several quotes in his stories and created fake email accounts that he used to impersonate people, one of which was a [[Gmail  account in my name"".<ref name=""Thompson editor's note""></ref>  Reed apologized to readers and to those misquoted. She noted that some of Thompson's work, most of it using public sources, was verifiable. Editors alerted any downstream users of the affected stories, and promised to take similar action if further fabrication came to light.<ref name=""Thompson editor's note"" />  Thompson suggested that the greater problem was [[racism  in the media field. He had made up [[pseudonym s for some of his sources, whom he described as ""poor black people who didn't want their names in the public given the situations"" and would not have spoken with a reporter otherwise. ""[T]he journalism that covers the experiences of poor black folk and the journalism others, such as you and First Look, are used to differs drastically,"" he argued. He also claimed he had felt a need to ""exaggerate my personal shit in order to prove my worth"" at ''The Intercept'' given incidents of racial bias he said he had witnessed there. When ''[[Gawker '' published his email, Reed said those allegations had not been in the version he sent her.<ref name=""Gawker Thompson story""></ref>  He was fired by ''The Intercept'' in early 2016, and according to Reed, did not cooperate with the investigation into his actions.<ref name=""The Guardian""></ref>  ===Exposure and arrest of a confidential source===  In early June 2017, ''The Intercept'' published a National Security Agency document that asserts Russian intelligence successfully hacked an American voter registration and poll software company, and used information culled to [[Phishing|phish  state election officials. The document was mailed from a source inside NSA, who did not reveal their identity to ''Intercept'' writers.<ref name=""Intercept 6-17""></ref> One hour after publication, a 25-year old NSA contract employee named [[Reality Winner  was arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation  and charged under the [[Espionage Act of 1917 .  The article bolstered public suspicion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. It also drew attention for being at odds with views held by editor Glenn Greenwald who had publicly ridiculed or dismissed allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia,<ref name=""Intercept 1-17""></ref> calling them ""radical conspiracy theories.""<ref name=""Democracy Now!""></ref> Greenwald alleged that the Democratic party hyperbolized the evidence supporting collusion complaints about Trump, in order to shift the blame for Trump's election as president away from the Democratic Party.<ref name=""Democracy Now!2""></ref>  The document explains that Russian intelligence attempted to crack the log-in information of the employees of a vendor providing voter registration software and databases for states to use with their election systems. It alleged that the Russians were successful enough that they were able to email 122 election officials, by posing as employees of the vendor.  According to [[David Folkenflik  of [[National Public Radio ,<blockquote>An ''Intercept'' reporter shared a photo of the papers with a source, a government contractor whom he trusted, seeking to validate it. The printout included a postmark of Augusta, Ga., and [[microdot s, a kind of computerized fingerprint. The contractor told his bosses, who informed the FBI.</blockquote> NSA quickly identified the leaker of the documents.  Verifying the legitimacy of leaked documents is common journalism practice, as is protecting third parties who may be harmed incidentally by the leak being published. However, professional media outlets who receive documents or recordings from confidential sources do not, as a practice, share the unfiltered primary evidence with a federal agency for review or verification, as it is known that metadata and unique identifiers may be revealed that were not obvious to the journalist, and the source exposed.<ref name=""Nieman Reports""></ref><ref name=""Source 17""></ref>  The evidence chain led to the arrest of Winner, a young Air Force veteran who was working in Georgia for Pluribus International Corporation, an NSA contractor, when the document was mailed to ''The Intercept''.<ref name=""FBI-rlwinner""></ref> ''The Intercept'' has been criticized for unprofessional handling of the document, and indifference to the source's safety.<ref name=""Mediaite""></ref>  Following the arrest of Winner, ''The Intercept'' released a statement saying it had ""no knowledge of the identity of the person who provided us with the document."" Allegations from the FBI about Winner, it added, were ""unproven assertions and speculation designed to serve the government's agenda and as such warrant skepticism.""  NSA whistleblower [[John Kiriakou  and [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp  whistleblower Joseph Hickman have both accused the same reporter accused of revealing Winner's identity, Matthew Cole, of playing a role in their exposure, which, in Kiriakou's case, led to his imprisonment.   On July 11, 2017, ''The Intercept'' announced that its parent company, First Look Media, through its Press Freedom Defense Fund, would provide $50,000 in matching funds to Stand with Reality, a crowd-funding campaign to support Winner's legal defense, plus a separate grant to engage a second law firm to assist Winner's principal attorneys, Augusta-based Bell & Brigham. Additionally, wrote editor-in-chief Betsy Reed, ""First Look's counsel Baruch Weiss of the firm [[Arnold & Porter|Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer  may support the defense efforts while continuing to represent First Look's interests.""  == Podcasts == === ''Intercepted'' ===  | hosting        = [[Jeremy Scahill     ''Intercepted'' is a weekly [[podcast  hosted by [[investigative journalist  [[Jeremy Scahill  and produced by [[First Look Media .

[[File:TorontoSunVendingMachine.jpg|thumb|A Toronto Sun newspaper vending machine  The ''Sun'' was first published on November 1, 1971, the Monday after the demise of  the ''[[Toronto Telegram '', a conservative [[broadsheet . As there was no publishing gap between the two papers and many of the Tely's writers and employees moved to the new paper, it is today generally considered as a direct continuation of the ''Telegram''. The ''Sun'' is the holder of the ''Telegram'' archives.  The ''Toronto Sun'' is modeled on British [[Red tops|tabloid journalism , even borrowing the name of ''[[The Sun  United Kingdom |The Sun '' newspaper published in London, and sharing some similar features of that paper.  As of the end of 2007, the ''Sun'' had a Monday through Saturday circulation of approximately 180,000 papers and Sunday circulation of 310,000.  The ''Sun'' is owned by [[Postmedia  following the 2015 purchase of [[Sun Media  from [[Quebecor . [[Torstar , the parent company of the ''Toronto Star'', once attempted to purchase the ''Sun''. The paper, which boasts the slogan ""Toronto's Other Voice""  also once called ""The Little Paper that Grew""  acquired a television station from [[Craig Media Inc.|Craig Media  in 2005, which was renamed [[CKXT-TV|SUN TV  and later was transformed into the [[Sun News Network  until its demise in 2015. By the mid-2000s  decade , the word ""The"" was dropped from the paper's name and the newspaper adopted its current logo.  The ''Toronto Sun'''s first editor was [[Peter Worthington . He assumed the title ""editor-in-chief"" in 1976, resigned in 1982 to protest the newspaper's takeover by Maclean-Hunter but remained a columnist for the paper until his death in 2013. He was succeeded by [[Barbara Amiel  who, in turn, was succeeded by [[John Downing   as editor . Other senior editors have included Lorrie Goldstein  city editor, editorial page editor , Linda Williamson  senior associate editor , Rob Granatstein  editorial page editor , and as editors-in-chief: Peter O'Sullivan, [[Mike Strobel , Jim Jennings, Glenn Garnett  2006–2007 , Lou Clancy  2007–2009 , James Wallace  2008–2013  and Wendy Metcalfe  2013-2015 . The current editor-in-chief is [[Adrienne Batra ; the publisher is Mike Power.  The ''Toronto Sun'' was originally published out of leased space at the Eclipse White Wear Company Building at 322 King Street West. In 1975, the newspaper moved into the [[Toronto Sun Building  at 333 King Street East which was eventually expanded to six storeys to house all of the newspaper's operations. In 2010, the building was sold to property development company First Gulf, the Sun consolidated its operations onto the second floor and remained in the building until 2016.  Following the acquisition of the Sun newspaper chain by [[Postmedia Network|PostMedia  in 2015, it was announced that the ''Toronto Sun'' staff and operations will move to 365 Bloor Street East, the same building that houses the ''[[National Post '', but that the two newspapers will maintain separate newsrooms. The move occurred in March 2016.  ==Editorial position==  Editorially, the paper frequently follows the positions of traditional Canadian/British conservatism and neo-conservatism in the United States on economic issues. Editorials typically promote individualism, self-reliance, the police, and a strong military and support for troops. Editorials typically condemn high taxes and, most of all, perceived government waste.  ==Sportsperson of the Year award== In 2004, the ''Sun'' began its annual [[George Gross  journalist |George Gross /Toronto Sun [[Athlete of the Year|Sportsperson of the Year  award.  == Circulation == The ''Toronto Sun'' has seen—like most [[List of newspapers in Canada#Daily newspapers|Canadian daily newspapers —a decline in [[Newspaper circulation|circulation . Its total circulation dropped by   percent to 121,304 copies daily from 2009 to 2015.<ref name=""Circulation""></ref>  :::::::::'''Daily average'''<ref name=""Circulation Chart""> Figures refer to the total circulation  print and digital combined  which includes paid and unpaid copies.</ref>   ==Sister papers== The ''Toronto Sun'''s [[Compact  newspaper |format  has given rise to sister Sun newspapers in major markets across Canada, namely the ''[[Edmonton Sun '', the ''[[Calgary Sun '' and the ''[[Ottawa Sun ''. The ''[[Winnipeg Sun '' was originally launched by independent interests, only later coming under common ownership to the ''Toronto Sun'', which subsequently elicited a redesign in Sun Media style.  ''[[The Vancouver Sun '' is a broadsheet and was never a [[Sun Media  newspaper.

854,Y,lbc.co.uk,"      '''LBC'''  originally the '''London Broadcasting Company'''  is a [[London -based national phone-in and [[talk radio  station.  It was the UK's first licensed [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial  [[radio station , beginning broadcasting on Monday 8 October 1973, a week ahead of [[Capital London|Capital Radio . The launch of LBC also saw the beginning of [[Independent Radio News|IRN 's broadcasting, as LBC provided the service to independent local radio stations nationwide.  LBC is owned by [[Global  company |Global  and has a like-branded sister station – [[LBC London News  – which is dedicated to rolling news, travel and weather, and is broadcast in London on [[medium wave|medium-wave  and [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB .  ==History==  ===Launch and early history=== [[David Jessel  was LBC's original breakfast presenter; he opened the station just before 6a.m. on Monday 8 October 1973. The original station spawned a number of stars who went on to become household names in the British media. They include [[Adrian Love , [[Jon Snow  journalist |Jon Snow , [[Peter Allen  UK broadcaster |Peter Allen , [[Rosie Boycott , and [[Bel Mooney . LBC's late-evening interview and phone-in programme between 9pm  later 10pm  and 1am was called ''Nightline ''and at various times was hosted by [[Adrian Love , [[Robin Houston , [[Monty Modlyn , [[Jeremy Beadle  and [[Tommy Boyd . There was also a character called 'Mr Nasty'  played by [[John Forrest  producer |John Forest  , who argued over the telephone with children. Beadle and Forrest went on to star in the [[Granada Television  series ''Fun Factory''.  ===Changes of ownership=== Originally owned by a consortium led by the Canadian [[Selkirk Communications  with a 46% stake, LBC was sold in 1987, beginning a turbulent commercial history.  The new owners were media company Darling Downs, later renamed Crown Communications, owned by Australian entrepreneur David Haynes.  Crown sold the station's original base in Gough Square near [[Fleet Street  in the [[City of London  and relocated to [[Hammersmith ; and in 1989 split the station into two separate services, the news and comment station LBC Crown FM, and the phone-in London Talkback Radio on AM.  The transition was not initially well received, and substantially increased costs, pushing the company into the red.  In 1993 the company was sold to [[Shirley Porter 's Chelverton Investments, after Crown got into financial difficulty.   ===London News Radio=== The company almost disappeared later in 1993, when the [[Radio Authority  failed to renew the company's two licences, LBC Newstalk and London Talkback Radio, awarding the frequencies instead to '''London News Radio''', a consortium led by former LBC staff and backed by [[Guinness Mahon . The prospective loss of the franchise brought Chelverton to the brink of collapse, and London News Radio  soon itself taken over by [[Reuters   bought LBC to keep it on air until the official handover date of October 1994.  London News Radio operated the station from LBC's former studios in Hammersmith as London News 97.3, a rolling news and travel information service on the [[Frequency modulation|FM band , and the phone-in-driven service London News Talk 1152 on the [[mediumwave|MW band . These names were simplified slightly in mid-1995 to News 97.3 and News Talk 1152 respectively, but between October 1994 and July 1996 the LBC name was not used on-air at all.  ===Return of LBC=== Reuters then brought in additional shareholders, and between 1996 and 2002 LBC was part of London News Radio Limited, a company owned jointly by [[ITN , [[Daily Mail and General Trust , Reuters, and the [[GWR Group . This new consortium revived the LBC name on 1152AM on 1 July 1996. At the end of 1996 the FM service was relaunched as News Direct 97.3FM.  Production for the station was moved to the basement of ITN's new multimedia building in [[Gray's Inn Road .  ===Chrysalis=== In 2002, the company was bought for £23.5m by the media company [[Chrysalis Group|Chrysalis , who trumpeted their purchase with the promise that they would lift the listenership to at least one million from around 700,000  LBC had enjoyed an audience of more than two million in the early 1980s . Production was moved to Chrysalis's base in [[North Kensington , and the formatting of the two frequencies was swapped, the talk format moving to FM and the news format to AM.  In 2005, the station's Managing Director Mark Flanagan left Chrysalis to set up a political consultancy company and was replaced by David Lloyd. Some claimed he held no previous experience in the talk and chat radio genre, which overlooked the almost two years he spent with the [[Century FM  brand in its Border TV ownership days where the station was a 50/50 music/talk service. He also introduced a [[PODcasting|podcasting  service called LBC Plus, and a number of premium-rate promotional opportunities to replace falling advertising revenues experienced by the radio sector.  In September 2006, the LBC 97.3 station became available in some other parts of the country on the digital [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB  platform, after Chrysalis bought out its partners and closed the [[DNN  radio |Digital News Network  rolling news station, which had previously been carried on the MXR multiplex.  Each multiplex region – the North West, West Midlands, Yorkshire, North East, South Wales, and the West – broadcast the London LBC transmission, augmented with occasional bulletins of regional news and travel information.  ===Global Radio=== In February 2007, Chrysalis confirmed media speculation that it was reviewing the entire radio operation at its investors' request. Further media speculation from ''[[The Guardian '' suggested that the group had little option, due to shareholder pressure, to sell its radio arm, including LBC, raising up to £200 million for new acquisitions, while ''[[The Daily Telegraph '' suggested that it could be the subject of a management buyout. Subsequently it was announced on 25 June 2007 that LBC along with its sister stations [[The Arrow  radio |The Arrow , [[Heart Network|Heart , and [[Galaxy Radio|Galaxy  network were to be sold for £170 million to [[Global Radio  by the [[Chrysalis Group , whose Chrysalis Radio operation closed down. In December 2008 the station moved to the [[Capital London  studios in Leicester Square.  In April 2007, a new marketing slogan for  what was then called  LBC 97.3 was introduced: ""London's Biggest Conversation"", a play on the station's initials.  Towards the end of October 2012, the station ceased DAB broadcasts to some parts of the country.  On 30 January 2014, LBC announced its intention to return to the DAB platform and began broadcasting nationally at 7am on 11 February 2014 under a new slogan, ""Leading Britain's Conversation"". LBC took up the slot previously occupied by [[Jazz FM  UK |Jazz FM   and briefly [[Birdsong  digital radio channel |Birdsong  , and dropped the ""97.3"" from the station name to reinforce the notion that it now had national coverage.  ==Podcasting== LBC claim to be the first radio station in the world to provide full-length [[podcast s for all its major shows, plus podcast-only shows and other things such as backstage interviews and mp3s sent to the show, under the name ''LBC Plus''. Most podcasts require a small subscription fee, but some shows, including Best Of programmes, podcast only shows and 'bitesize' versions of programmes, are free.  ==Controversies== ===Tony Blair appearance=== On 13 January 2004, then British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister  [[Tony Blair  presented an hour-long phone-in show on the station, taking pre-booked calls from LBC 97.3 listeners. His appearance was part of the 'Big Conversation' initiative to promote government as being more accessible and in touch with the people. During the 1011am show, a caller explained that he'd been denied access to his children for five years and asked what Blair was planning to do about other fathers in a similar situation. The Prime Minister assured the caller he would look into his case personally. It later transpired that the caller was in fact [[Fathers 4 Justice  member Ron Davis, who in May of that year was arrested for entering Parliament and throwing a condom containing purple powder over Blair and nearby Cabinet members. Davis claimed the attack was in response to the Prime Minister's failure to contact him or look into the matters discussed on LBC 97.3.  ===Ken Livingstone appearances=== During his tenure as London Mayor, [[Ken Livingstone  was a regular guest on LBC 97.3, appearing usually once per month on the [[Nick Ferrari  breakfast show. During the show he took calls from LBC listeners and discussed points put to him by Ferrari. It became something of a running joke that the Mayor usually arrived late, blaming it on the public transport. Livingstone's phone-in sessions alternated between LBC and [[BBC London 94.9 , and was an opportunity for Londoners to talk to the then-London Mayor. After losing the [[London mayoral election, 2008|2008 mayoral election , Livingstone began his own Saturday Morning programme on LBC, on 30 August 2008. He stood down in March 2012 to concentrate on running for London Mayor again, and was replaced by the former Labour Home Secretary [[Jacqui Smith . Until the spring of 2016, he co-hosted a slot on Saturday mornings with David Mellor.  ===Large Hadron Collider switch-on controversy=== The radio station received dozens of complaints after a broadcast on 10 September 2008 proclaimed that the [[Global catastrophic risk|end of the world  was nigh, due to the initial tests of the [[Large Hadron Collider  taking place that day. The station held a [[phone-in  where people would say 'goodbye' to Earth. Due to this broadcast being made during the [[school run , most complaints were from parents complaining that their children were terrified by the broadcast.  ===Jeni Barnett and MMR vaccine controversy===   The radio station became involved in the [[MMR vaccine controversy  after a broadcast by [[Jeni Barnett  on 7 January 2009 in which she debated the putative dangers of MMR vaccine with callers. It became the subject of media controversy, first because her views were criticised as irresponsible by medical journalist Dr [[Ben Goldacre , and then because LBC and Global Radio threatened legal action against Goldacre for copyright infringement after he refused to remove the audio of the show from his blog, which resulted in its being made available at Wikileaks and elsewhere and the preparation of transcripts of the broadcast. [[David Aaronovitch  in ''[[The Times '' argued for ""a class action against LBC for permitting a presenter to inflict her preposterous prejudices on her listeners, to the detriment of someone else's kids."" [[Norman Lamb  MP tabled an [[Early Day Motion  criticising Barnett and LBC for the likely effect of the broadcast on public health.  ==Notable presenters==    *[[Nick Abbot  *[[Steve Allen  radio presenter |Steve Allen  *[[Clive Bull  *[[Andrew Castle  *[[Iain Dale  *[[Nigel Farage  *[[Nick Ferrari  *[[Matt Frei   *[[Shelagh Fogarty  *[[Eddie Mair  *[[Jacob Rees-Mogg  *[[Maajid Nawaz  *[[James O'Brien  broadcaster |James O'Brien  *[[Ian Payne  sports broadcaster |Ian Payne  *[[Andrew Pierce  *[[Matthew Stadlen    ===Call-in shows===  LBC has held call-in shows for politicians [[Nick Clegg , [[Nigel Farage , and [[Boris Johnson . In 2016, it was announced that [[Alex Salmond  would be taking part in a weekly call-in show. This show ran from 13 January to 30 March that year. Salmond was then given a three-hour Sunday afternoon show, starting in 17 September 2017, after he lost his seat in the [[UK general election 2017 .  ==Awards and nominations== {| class=""wikitable"" width=""100%"" |- !

Dillon Ripley , to produce a magazine ""about things in which the Smithsonian [Institution] is interested, might be interested or ought to be interested.""<ref name=smith/>  Thompson would later recall that his philosophy for the new magazine was that it ""would stir curiosity in already receptive minds. It would deal with history as it is relevant to the present. It would present art, since true art is never dated, in the richest possible reproduction. It would peer into the future via coverage of social progress and of science and technology. Technical matters would be digested and made intelligible by skilled writers who would stimulate readers to reach upward while not turning them off with jargon. We would find the best writers and the best photographers—not unlike the best of the old ''Life''.""<ref name=smith></ref>  In 1973, the magazine turned a profit for the first time. By 1974, circulation had nearly quadrupled, to 635,000, and it reached the one million milestone in 1975—one of the most successful launches of its time. In 1980, Thompson was replaced by Don Moser, who had also worked at ''Life'', and circulation reached upwards of two million, in turn, by Carey Winfrey upon his retirement in 2001.  ==Content== ''Smithsonian'' magazine provides in-depth analysis of varied topics within a diverse range of scientific areas, and adds photography to supplement its comprehensive features. The monthly magazine looks at the topics and subject matters researched, studied and exhibited by the Smithsonian Institution - science, history, art, popular culture and innovation - and chronicles them for its diverse readership.  ==Smithsonian American Ingenuity Awards== Every year since 2012, the Magazine has sponsored the American Ingenuity Awards, a recognition of innovation in the arts, sciences and technology.

880,Y,globalvoices.org,"    '''Global Voices''' is an international community of writers, [[bloggers  and digital activists that aim to translate and report on what is being said in citizen media worldwide. It is a non-profit project started at the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society  at [[Harvard Law School  that grew out of an international [[blog|bloggers ' meeting held in December 2004. The organization was founded by [[Ethan Zuckerman  and [[Rebecca MacKinnon . In 2008, it became an independent non-profit incorporated in [[Amsterdam , [[Netherlands .  ==Objectives== When Global Voices was formed, Its objectives were: first, to enable and empower a community of ""bridge bloggers"" who ""can make a bridge between two languages, or two cultures."" Second to develop tools and resources to make achieving the first objective more effective. It has maintained a working relationship with mainstream media. Reuters, for example, gave Global Voices unrestricted grants from 2006 to 2008. For its contribution to innovation in journalism, Global Voices was granted the 2006 Knight-Batten Grand Prize. Global Voices was also recognized in 2009 with the [[University of Denver 's Anvil of Freedom award for contributions to journalism and democracy.  The organization now states its goals as to:  *""Call attention to the most interesting conversations and perspectives emerging from citizens’ media around the world by linking to text, photos, podcasts, video and other forms of grassroots citizens’ media.""  *""Facilitate the emergence of new citizens’ voices through training, online tutorials, and publicizing the ways in which open-source and free tools can be used safely by people around the world"". *""Advocate for freedom of expression ... and protect the rights of citizen journalists"".  Global Voices has a team of regional editors that aggregates and selects conversations from a variety of [[blogosphere|blogospheres , with a particular focus on non-Western and underrepresented voices. Contributors are volunteers.  ==Projects== Several projects have grown to become successful websites of their own with distinct communities.  ===Global Voices Advocacy=== Global Voices Advox  formerly Advocacy  is an international network of bloggers and activists who fight for online free speech and track threats against ""netizens"". Advox were among the first to recognize arrests and killings of bloggers  starting in 2007  and were instrumental in helping to shift the focus of international media rights organizations to include online writers.  ===Rising Voices=== Rising Voices seeks to empower under-represented communities to make their voices heard online by providing micro-grants to new projects; developing a series of participatory media tutorials; and cultivating a network of passionate citizen media activists. The first round of micro-grants were awarded in 2007 following a grant from Knight News Challenge Award.  ===Global Voices Lingua=== Volunteers who wished to translate Global Voiced content from English into other languages formed [[Project Lingua  in 2007. Since then, translation has become central to Global Voices. There are tens of translation sites existing in Lingua.  ===RuNet Echo=== RuNet Echo’s main purpose is to expand and deepen understanding of the Russian Internet  [[RuNet   and related online communities.  ==Past projects==  ===Technology for Transparency Network=== The Technology for Transparency Network was a participatory research and mapping project to gain a better understanding of the current state of online technology projects that increase transparency, government accountability, and civic engagement in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia, China, and Central & Eastern Europe. The project is co-funded by Open Society Institute's Information Program and Omidyar Network's Media, Markets & Transparency initiative, and aims to inform both programs' future investments toward transparency, accountability, and civic engagement technology projects.  ===Voices without Votes=== During the United States presidential election of 2008 Global Voices was commissioned by Reuters to create a website, Voices without Votes, to track global online conversation about US politics and foreign policy. Amira al Hussaini was editor of the website, and Global Voices authors and editors all contributed in the 8 months leading up to Barack Obama's [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration  in January 2009.  ===The Witness Hub=== From 2006-2007, Global Voices and human rights video organization [[Witness  organization |WITNESS  collaborated on a pilot project to monitor human rights citizen videos from around the world. The effort was led by Sameer Padania, and won Best New Media Project at the One World Media Awards in 2007. WITNESS developed The Hub as central part of their own website in 2008, launching a community forum where people can upload human rights videos themselves. The Hub was itself archived in 2010, and in collaboration with [[YouTube  and social media curation site [[Storyful , Witness launched a YouTube Human Rights Channel in May 2012.  ==References==   ==External links== *  * [https://rising.globalvoices.org/ Rising Voices] * [https://advox.globalvoices.org/ Global Voices Advocacy] * [https://globalvoices.org/lingua Global Voices Lingua] * [http://www.ted.com/talks/ethan_zuckerman.html Video of Ethan Zuckerman talking about Global Voices at TED] * [http://99faces.tv/julianarotich/ Juliana Rotich  Editor of Editing Global Voices  in Interview with 99FACES - This is What I See!

The magazine was founded by the author [[William F. Buckley Jr.  in 1955.<ref name=""rperlstein""/> It is currently edited by [[Rich Lowry .  Since its founding, the magazine has played a significant role in the development of [[conservatism in the United States , helping to define its boundaries<ref name=""rperlstein""/> and promoting [[fusionism  while establishing itself as a leading voice on the [[American right .<ref name=""rperlstein""></ref><ref name=""brooksd""></ref>  The online version, '''''National Review Online''''', is edited by [[Charles C. W. Cooke  and includes free content and articles separate from the print edition.  == History ==  === Background ===  Before ''National Review''s founding in 1955, the [[American right  was a largely unorganized collection of people who shared intertwining philosophies but had little opportunity for a united public voice. They also wanted to marginalize what they saw as the [[antiwar , noninterventionistic views of the [[Old Right  United States |Old Right .  In 1953 moderate Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower  was president, and many major magazines such as the ''[[Saturday Evening Post '', ''[[Time  magazine |Time '', and ''[[Reader's Digest '' were strongly conservative and anticommunist, as were many newspapers including the ''[[Chicago Tribune '' and St. Louis ''[[Globe-Democrat ''. A few small-circulation conservative magazines, such as ''[[Human Events '' and ''[[The Freeman '', preceded ''National Review'' in developing [[Cold War  Conservatism in the 1950s.  === Early years === In 1953, [[Russell Kirk  published ''The Conservative Mind'', which sought to trace an intellectual bloodline from [[Edmund Burke <ref name=""autogenerated186"">Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson  2006  ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia''. ISI Books, Wilmington, DE, pp. 186–88</ref> to the [[Old Right  United States |Old Right  in the early 1950s. This challenged the popular notion that no coherent conservative tradition existed in the United States.<ref name=""autogenerated186""/>  [[Image:William F. Buckley, Jr. 1985.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William F. Buckley Jr. , the founder of ''National Review''  pictured in 1985    A young [[William F. Buckley Jr.  was greatly influenced by Kirk's concepts. Buckley, from a wealthy [[Petroleum|oil  family, first tried to purchase ''[[Human Events '', but was turned down. He then met [[Willi Schlamm , the experienced editor of ''[[The Freeman ''; they would spend the next two years raising the $300,000 necessary to start their own weekly magazine, originally to be called ''National Weekly''.  A magazine holding the trademark to the name prompted the change to ''National Review''.  The statement of intentions read:  <blockquote>Middle-of-the-Road, qua Middle of the Road, is politically, intellectually, and morally repugnant. We shall recommend policies for the simple reason that we consider them right  rather than “non-controversial” ; and we consider them right because they are based on principles we deem right  rather than on popularity polls ... The [[New Deal  revolution, for instance, could hardly have happened save for the cumulative impact of ''[[The Nation '' and ''[[The New Republic '', and a few other publications, on several American college generations during the twenties and thirties.</blockquote>  === Contributors === On November 19, 1955, Buckley’s magazine began to take shape. Buckley assembled an eclectic group of writers: traditionalists, Catholic intellectuals, libertarians and ex-Communists. The group included: [[Russell Kirk , [[James Burnham , [[Frank Meyer  political philosopher |Frank Meyer , and [[Willmoore Kendall , Catholics [[L. Brent Bozell Jr.|L. Brent Bozell  and [[Garry Wills . The former ''[[Time  magazine |Time '' editor [[Whittaker Chambers , who had been a Communist spy in the 1930s, eventually became a senior editor. In the magazine’s founding statement Buckley wrote:  <blockquote>Let’s Face it: Unlike Vienna, it seems altogether possible that did ''National Review'' not exist, no one would have invented it. The launching of a conservative weekly journal of opinion in a country widely assumed to be a bastion of conservatism at first glance looks like a work of supererogation, rather like publishing a royalist weekly within the walls of Buckingham Palace. It is not that of course; if ''National Review'' is superfluous, it is so for very different reasons: It stands athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no other is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it.</blockquote>  As editors and contributors, Buckley especially sought out intellectuals who were ex-Communists or had once worked on the far Left, including Whittaker Chambers, [[Willi Schlamm|William Schlamm , [[John Dos Passos , Frank Meyer and James Burnham. When James Burnham became one of the original senior editors, he urged the adoption of a more pragmatic editorial position that would extend the influence of the magazine toward the political center. Smant  1991  finds that Burnham overcame sometimes heated opposition from other members of the editorial board  including Meyer, Schlamm, William Rickenbacker, and the magazine's publisher [[William A. Rusher  , and had a significant effect on both the editorial policy of the magazine and on the thinking of Buckley himself.  === Mission to conservatives === ''National Review'' aimed to make conservative ideas respectable,<ref name=""rperlstein""/> in an age when the dominant view of conservative thought was expressed by [[Lionel Trilling  in 1950:  <blockquote>In the United States at this time liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition. For it is the plain fact that nowadays there are no conservative or reactionary ideas in general circulation... the conservative impulse and the reactionary impulse do not... express themselves in ideas but only... in irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas.</blockquote>  William Buckley Jr., on the purpose of ''National Review'':  <blockquote>[''National Review''] stands athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no one is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it… it is out of place because, in its maturity, literate America rejected conservatism in favor of radical social experimentation…since ideas rule the world, the ideologues, having won over the intellectual class, simply walked in and started to…run just about everything. There never was an age of conformity quite like this one, or a camaraderie quite like the Liberals’.</blockquote>  ''National Review'' promoted [[Barry Goldwater  heavily during the early 1960s. Buckley and others involved with the magazine took a major role in the ""Draft Goldwater"" movement in 1960 and the 1964 presidential campaign.  ''National Review'' spread his vision of conservatism throughout the country.  The early ''National Review'' faced occasional defections from both left and right.  [[Garry Wills  broke with N.R. and became a liberal commentator. Buckley’s brother-in-law, [[L. Brent Bozell Jr. , who ghostwrote ''The Conscience of a Conservative'' for Barry Goldwater, left and started the short-lived [[traditionalist Catholic  magazine, ''[[Triumph  magazine |Triumph '' in 1966.  === Defining the boundaries of conservatism ===  Buckley and Meyer promoted the idea of enlarging the boundaries of conservatism through [[fusionism  politics |fusionism , whereby different schools of conservatives, including [[libertarians , would work together to combat what were seen as their common opponents.<ref name=""rperlstein""/>  Buckley and his editors used his magazine to define the boundaries of conservatism—and to exclude people or ideas or groups they considered unworthy of the conservative title. Therefore, they attacked the [[John Birch Society , [[George Wallace , and anti-Semites.<ref name=""rperlstein""/>  Buckley's goal was to increase the respectability of the conservative movement; as [[Rich Lowry  noted: ""Mr. Buckley's first great achievement was to purge the American right of its kooks. He marginalized the anti-Semites, the John Birchers, the [[Nativism  politics |nativists  and their sort.""  In 1957, ''National Review'' editorialized in favor of white leadership in the South, arguing that ""the central question that emerges... is whether the White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail, politically and culturally, in areas where it does not predominate numerically? The sobering answer is Yes – the White community is so entitled because, for the time being, it is the advanced race."" By the 1970s ''National Review'' advocated colorblind policies and the end of [[affirmative action .  In the late 1960s, the magazine denounced segregationist [[George Wallace , who ran in Democratic primaries in 1964 and 1972 and made an independent run for president in 1968. During the 1950s, Buckley had worked to remove [[anti-Semitism  from the conservative movement and barred holders of those views from working for ''National Review''. In 1962 Buckley denounced [[Robert W. Welch Jr.  and the [[John Birch Society  as ""far removed from common sense"" and urged the [[Republican Party  United States |Republican Party  to purge itself of Welch's influence.  === After Goldwater === After Goldwater was defeated by [[Lyndon Johnson  in 1964, Buckley and ''National Review'' continued to champion the idea of a conservative movement, which was increasingly embodied in [[Ronald Reagan . Reagan, a longtime subscriber to ''National Review'', first became politically prominent during Goldwater's campaign. ''National Review'' supported his challenge to President [[Gerald Ford  in 1976 and his successful 1980 campaign.  During the 1980s ''N.R.'' called for tax cuts, [[supply-side economics , the [[Strategic Defense Initiative , and support for President Reagan's foreign policy against the [[Soviet Union . The magazine criticized the [[Welfare state  and would support the [[Welfare reform  proposals of the 1990s. The magazine also regularly criticized President [[Bill Clinton . It first embraced, then rejected, [[Pat Buchanan  in his political campaigns. A lengthy 1996 National Review editorial called for a ""movement toward"" drug legalization.  In 1985, the National Review and Buckley were represented by attorney [[J. Daniel Mahoney  during the magazine's $16 million libel suit against ''[[The Spotlight ''.<ref name=""The Washington Times; October 25, 1985""></ref>  == Political views and content == [[Victor Davis Hanson , a regular contributor since 2001, sees a broad spectrum of conservative and anti-liberal contributors: :In other words, a wide conservative spectrum—paleo-conservatives, neo-conservatives, tea-party enthusiasts, the deeply religious and the agnostic, both libertarians and social conservatives, free-marketeers and the more protectionist—characterizes ''National Review. '' The common requisite is that they present their views as a critique of prevailing liberal orthodoxy but do so analytically and with decency and respect.  The magazine has been described as ""the bible of [[conservatism in the United States|American conservatism "".<ref name=""TitanicReshufflingDeckChairsNRCruise-NewRepublic"">Hari, Johann, ''Titanic: Reshuffling the Deck Chairs on the National Review Cruise'', in ''The New Republic'', vol. 237, issue 1, July 2, 2007  in ''MasterFile Premier''  EbscoHost   PDF   subscription may be required  , p.&nbsp;31</ref>  === Donald Trump === In 2015, the magazine published an editorial entitled ""Against Trump,"" calling him a ""philosophically unmoored political opportunist"" and announcing its opposition to his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president. Since Trump's election to the presidency, the ''National Review'' editorial board has continued to criticize him.  However, contributors to ''National Review'' and ''National Review Online'' take a variety of positions on Trump. Liberal commentator [[Peter Beinart  criticized Lowry and Hanson for ""breez[ing] by Trump’s blatant assaults on long-held conservative values in their rush to find something, anything, to congratulate him for,"" while ''National Review'' contributors such as Ramesh Ponnuru and Jonah Goldberg have remained critical of Trump. In a ''Washington Post'' feature on conservative magazines, T.A. Frank noted: ""From the perspective of a reader, these tensions make National Review as lively as it has been in a long time.""  == ''National Review Online'' == A popular feature of ''National Review'' is the web version of the magazine, ''National Review Online''  ""N.R.O."" , which includes a digital version of the magazine, with articles updated daily by ''National Review'' writers, and conservative blogs. The on-line version is called ''N.R.O.'' to distinguish it from the paper magazine. It also features free articles, though these deviate in content from its print magazine. The site's editor is [[Charles C. W. Cooke .  Each day, the site posts new content consisting of conservative, libertarian, and neoconservative opinion articles, including some syndicated columns, and news features.  It also features two [[blogs : * '''The Corner''' – postings from a select group of the site's editors and affiliated writers discussing the issues of the day * '''Bench Memos''' – legal and judicial news and commentary  [[Markos Moulitsas , who runs the [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal  ''[[Daily Kos '' web-site, told reporters in August 2007 that he does not read conservative blogs, with the exception of those on N.R.O.: ""I do like the blogs at the ''National Review''—I do think their writers are the best in the [conservative] blogosphere,"" he said.  == National Review Institute == The N.R.I. works in policy development and helping establish new advocates in the conservative movement. National Review Institute was founded by William F. Buckley Jr. in 1991 to engage in policy development, public education, and advocacy that would advance the conservative principles he championed.  In 2019, the [[Whittaker Chambers  family had NRI stop an award in Chambers' name following award to people whom the family found objectionable.<ref name=WSJ-Award> </ref><ref name=WEF-Award> </ref>  == Finances == As with most political opinion magazines in the United States, ''National Review'' carries little corporate advertising. The magazine stays afloat by donations from subscribers and black-tie fund raisers around the country. The magazine also sponsors cruises featuring ''National Review'' editors and contributors as lecturers.<ref name=""TitanicReshufflingDeckChairsNRCruise-NewRepublic"" />  Buckley said in 2005 that the magazine had lost about $25,000,000 over fifty years.  == Presidential primary endorsements == ''National Review'' sometimes endorses a candidate during the primary election season. Editors at ''National Review'' have said, ""Our guiding principle has always been to select the most conservative viable candidate."" This statement echoes what has come to be called ""The Buckley Rule"". In a 1967 interview, in which he was asked about the choice of presidential candidate, Buckley said, ""The wisest choice would be the one who would win... I'd be for the most right, viable candidate who could win.""  The following candidates were officially endorsed by ''National Review'':    * 1956: [[Dwight Eisenhower  * 1960: no endorsement<ref name=""Jonah Goldberg, December 15, 2011""></ref> * 1964: [[Barry Goldwater  * 1968: [[Richard Nixon <ref name=""Jonah Goldberg, December 15, 2011""/> * 1972: [[John M.

Geraghty's column notes that it was unlikely that Obama was born in Kenya. Attorney Loren Collins, who has tracked the origins of birtherism for years, says that Geraghty may have ""unwittingly shined a national spotlight on a fringe internet theory.""<ref name="":0""></ref>  Geraghty's article ""became fodder for cable television."" In a 2009 editorial, the ''National Review'' editorial board called conspiracies about Obama's citizenship ""untrue,"" writing: ""Like Bruce Springsteen, he has a lot of bad political ideas; but he was born in the U.S.A.""  One ''National Review'' article said that Obama's parents could be communists because “for a white woman to marry a black man in 1958, or ’60, there was almost inevitably a connection to explicit Communist politics”.<ref name="":1""></ref>  By 2018, Dinesh D'Souza was on the ''National Review'' masthead, despite stirring controversy for a number of years making inflammatory remarks and promoting conspiracy theories. D'Souza had shared a meme calling former President Barack Obama a “gay Muslim” and suggesting Michelle Obama was a man. In comments that earned rebukes from ''National Review'' colleagues, D'Souza said that Hungarian-born George Soros was a ""collection boy for Hitler and the Nazis,"" attacked Roy Moore accuser Beverly Young Nelson, said that accusations against Roy Moore were “most likely fabricated,” and described Rosa Parks as an ""overrated Democrat"".  === Climate change === According to Philip Bump of ''The Washington Post'', ''National Review'' ""has regularly criticized and rejected the scientific consensus on climate change"".<ref name="":2""></ref> In 2015, the magazine published an intentionally deceptive graph that suggested that there was no climate change.<ref name="":2"" /><ref name="":3""></ref> The graph set the lower and upper bounds of the chart at -10 and 110 degree Fahrenheit and zoomed out so as to obscure warming trends.<ref name="":3"" />  In 2017, ''National Review'' published an article alleging that a top NOAA scientist claimed that National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  engaged in data manipulation and rushed a study based on faulty data in order to influence the Paris climate negotiations.<ref name="":4""></ref> The article largely repeated allegations made in ''The Daily Mail'' without independent verification. The scientist in question later rebuked the claims made by the ''National Review'', noting that he did not accuse NOAA of data manipulation but instead raised concerns about ""the way data was handled, documented and stored, raising issues of transparency and availability"".<ref name="":4"" />  In 2014, climate scientist [[Michael E. Mann  sued the ''National Review'' after columnist Mark Steyn accused Mann of fraud and referenced a quote from Competitive Enterprise Institute writer Rand Simberg that called Mann ""the Jerry Sandusky of climate science, except that instead of molesting children, he has molested and tortured data.""<ref name=""Ars Technica""></ref> Civil-liberties organizations such as the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation and several publications such as ''The Washington Post'' expressed support for National Review in the lawsuit, filing amicus briefs in their defense. There is no evidence that Mann has engaged in fraud.<ref name=""Ars Technica""/>  === Ann Coulter 9/11 column === Two days after the 9/11 attacks, National Review published a column by Ann Coulter where she wrote of Muslims, ""This is no time to be precious about locating the exact individuals directly involved in this particular terrorist attack. We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We weren’t punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That’s war. And this is war."" National Review later called the column a ""mistake"" and fired Coulter as a contributing editor.  == References ==   == Bibliography == * [[Patrick Allitt|Allitt, Patrick .

897,Y,dailytelegraph.com.au,"     '''''The Daily Telegraph''''' is an Australian daily [[Tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid  newspaper published in [[Sydney , [[New South Wales , by Nationwide News Limited, a division of [[News Corp Australia , formerly News Limited.  ''The Daily Telegraph'' is published Monday through Saturday and is available throughout [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney , across most of regional and remote [[New South Wales , the [[Australian Capital Territory  and [[South East Queensland .  Amongst those ranked by [[Nielsen Corporation|Nielsen , the Telegraph's website is the 6th most popular Australian news website, and the most popular paid-subscription Australian news website. with a unique monthly audience of 2,841,381 readers.  ==History== ''The Tele'', as it is also known, was founded in 1879. From 1936 to 1972, it was owned by [[Sir Frank Packer 's [[ACP Magazines|Australian Consolidated Press . That year it was sold to News Limited  now [[News Corp Australia  .  The paper ran as a [[broadsheet  until 1927, when it switched to a [[Tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid  format. The paper returned to a broadsheet format in 1931, but wartime paper restrictions saw it return to tabloid format in 1942.  In February 1957 the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia|Australian Prime Minister , [[Robert Menzies , barred correspondents of ''The Daily Telegraph'' from his press conferences because the paper had been critical of his policies.  In October 1990, it [[Mergers and acquisitions|merged  with its afternoon sister paper ''[[The Daily Mirror  Sydney |The Daily Mirror '' to form ''The Daily Telegraph-Mirror'' with morning and afternoon editions. The new paper continued in this vein until January 1996 when the paper name reverted to ''The Daily Telegraph'', in the process, removing the last vestige of the old ''Daily Mirror'', although the paper continued morning and afternoon editions until January 2002, when the afternoon edition was discontinued.  The circulation of the newspaper during the June quarter 2013 was 310,724 on weekdays,<ref name=""Knott2013""></ref> the largest of a Sydney newspaper. In the 2013-14 [[Australian financial year|financial year  it decreased 9.65% to 280,731.<ref name=""circ14a"">Mediaweek August/Enhanced Media Metrics Australia  emma </ref><ref name=""circ14b""></ref>  ==Controversies== A 2013 poll conducted by Essential Research found that the ''Telegraph'' was Australia's least-trusted major newspaper, with 41% of respondents citing trust in the paper.  === Tony Zoef Defamation === On 22 August 2013, the Daily Telegraph published an article headlined ""Tailor’s alter ego as a gunrunner"".  The article referred to an individual who was known to Sutherlind Shire locals as a ""friendly tailor who spends his days altering their clothes"".  The article claimed that the individual was ""alleged"" by police to be ""the mastermind behind a haul of military-grade weapons smuggled into Australia"".  The article mistakenly attributed the alleged crimes to the wrong individual, who subsequently filed a complaint of defamation in the New South Wales Discrict Court.  In the first instance, the Court found that, despite the serious errors in the article, the publisher's defence based on a prior offer of amends should prevail.  On appeal, the Supreme Court of NSW upheld the complaint of defamation.  It held that, ""Taking into account the seriousness of the defamatory imputations and the significant hurt they caused the appellant, the damage to his business as a tailor, the unequal prominence the respondent afforded to the proposed correction and apology and their resultant inadequacy, the modest monetary component of the offer, and the likelihood of the proceedings being successful, the offer of amends was not reasonable.""    The Court awarded a sum of $150,000 to the complainant.  === Reporting of Transgender Woman Accused of Violent Axe Attack === In January 2017, the Daily Telegraph published an article concerning a transgender woman subsequently convicted of a violent axe attack in a Sydney suburb. Although her transgender status was irrelevant to the incident at the time, The Daily Telegraph used derogatory slurs and made repeated references to the attacker's  history of sex reassignment surgery, calling the woman a ""tranny"" who ""had chopped herself"".  The following week, [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS  published an article expressing concern about how journalists ""appear to enjoy treating transgender people as the punchline to a joke,"" singling out the Daily Telegraph's journalist.  In September 2018, the [[NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal  considered whether the article constituted unlawful vilification through its ""gratuitous references to"", and ""ridicule of"" the woman's transgender status.<ref name=""caselaw.nsw.gov.au"">https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/5b9ef377e4b0b9ab4020fa95</ref>  The Tribunal found that the Daily Telegraph published the article with ""apparent disregard for the injurious effect it might have on transgender people."" The Tribunal also held that, ""it is evident that [the journalist] was seeking to make fun of Ms Amati and probably transgender people more generally,"" and that the ""attempt at humour was in poor taste and completely devoid of empathy or sensitivity.""  Continuing, the Tribunal also held that the article ""contributes to the perpetration and perpetuation of demeaning negative stereotypes and a lack of acceptance of transgender people within the community.""  The Tribunal ultimately concluded that, whilst ""close to the line"", the article did not reach the threshold for vilification.<ref name=""caselaw.nsw.gov.au""/>  Lawyer Michael Bradley wrote an analysis of the case for political news website [[Crikey , arguing that the publication of such articles should not be unlawful, but instead that the Daily Telegraph should have sufficient social responsibility to cease publishing the author's ""recklessly hurtful attempts at wit — because he did, and does, harm.""  As of September 2018, the article has been removed from the website of the Daily Telegraph and replaced with a notice stating ""This article is no longer available.""  === Infographic on Health and Gay Children ===  On 12 July 2017, the Daily Telegraph published an article headlined ""Fat Chance Of Being Health” in print.  The article was syndicated online under the headline ""Junk food, alcohol and drugs are fuelling health crisis in young adults"".  The article contained an infographic that canvassed social health concerns, such as alcohol usage, obesity, and drug dependency, for which ""Young Aussies have only themselves to blame"".  The infographic included ""same sex attraction"" among the condemnable health problems it canvassed.  A number of [[LGBT | LGBTI  Australians complained that the article was prejudicial, saying that sexual orientation is neither a choice nor a medical problem, and such coverage contributes to prejudice, shame and suicide risk for young same-sex attracted people.  The 'blameworthiness' implicit in the headline was alleged to perpetuate negative stereotypes about gay children.  The article drew condemnation from the ABC's Media Watch, Sydney radio station 2 DAY FM, Pedestrian TV, and Junkee.  Chris Dore, the publication's Chief Editor, responded to the criticism from the Daily Telegraph's social media accounts, saying the story had been ""misinterpreted"" and that it ""in no way suggests, or intends to suggest, that same-sex relationships are unhealthy.  There is no judgement expressed at all in the story other than diet.""  The press regulator, the [[Australian Press Council  was asked to consider whether the article complied with its [https://www.presscouncil.org.au/statements-of-principles/ Statement of General Principles].  The Council concluded its investigations five months later.  It upheld the complaint, saying ""the reference to ill health and blame in the headlines, with the statistic about same-sex attraction displayed among factors such as obesity and drug use, suggested same-sex attraction is unhealthy and blameworthy. As a result, the article caused substantial offence, distress, prejudice and risk to public health and safety, and there was no public interest justifying this.""  The Daily Telegraph was further sanctioned by the Australian Press Council for failing to comply with the requirements around publication of adjudication findings.  The Press Council required the publisher to republish the print component of the adjudication as it was not fully compliant with its requirements in the first instance. The reprint was published on January 24, 2018.  The Daily Telegraph claimed that ""nothing sinister had occurred [in the non-compliance]"", and blamed the misdemeanour on a production error.  === John Brogden allegations === The ''Telegraph'' was widely criticised for its coverage of former New South Wales [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal  leader [[John Brogden  politician |John Brogden . After Brogden resigned in 2005, the newspaper ran a front-page headline, ""Brogden's Sordid Past: Disgraced Liberal leader damned by secret shame file,"" detailing past allegations of misconduct by Brogden. The following day, Brogden attempted suicide at his electoral office.  [[Rodney Tiffen , an academic at the [[University of Sydney , described the newspaper's coverage as an example of ""hyena journalism"", judging Brogden's personal life to be off limits following his withdrawal from public life.  Editor [[David Penberthy  claimed that his source was from inside the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party  and that none of the events would have happened if no one leaked from inside the party.  === Mount Druitt High School === On 8 January 1997, the ''Telegraph'' published the headline, ""The class we failed"" concerning was the Year 12 class at [[Mount Druitt, New South Wales|Mount Druitt  High School in outer [[Greater Western Sydney|Western Sydney  in which no student scored a Tertiary Entrance Rank  TER  above 50  the maximum possible rank is 100 . Although the article made clear that the newspaper believed that the state had failed the students, many accused the ''Telegraph'' of branding the students themselves as failures and showing a full year photo identifying students.  The story led to a renewed focus on the quality of public schools in Western Sydney and precipitated several reviews of schooling in the area. But for many, the headline highlighted problems with ''interpreting'' [[Higher School Certificate  New South Wales |Higher School Certificate  results and the accompanying TER.  The students successfully sued the newspaper in the Supreme Court for defamation. The ''Telegraph'' subsequently apologised and settled for damages out of court.<ref name=""autogenerated2"">[http://www.nswtf.org.au/edu_online/13/gdruitt.html NSW Teachers Federation: Education Online: November 2000: Telegraph apologises to Mt Druitt students] </ref> The published apology stated:   Later, criticising defamation laws, News Limited CEO John Hartigan said that   === Call centres in India === In October 2006, ''The Telegraph'' claimed in a front-page article that [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ  were using call centres in [[Bangalore , India. The paper even sent a journalist to Bangalore, Luke McIlveen, and a photographer to verify this claim. ANZ denied the claim, stating that they do not employ overseas call centre staff in India.<ref name=anzpressrelease></ref> Subsequently, ANZ pulled all of its advertising from [[News Corp Australia|News Limited , including [[Foxtel  and News website, which amounted to $4 to 5 million, about 10 per cent of ANZ's advertising budget.<ref name=anzpressrelease/>  In assuming blame, [[David Penberthy , editor-in-chief of [[News Corp Australia|News Limited , defended McIlveen.  ===Allegations of plagiarism=== In 2002, former ''Telegraph'' journalist, Matt Sun, was accused of [[plagiarism  by the TV program ''[[Media Watch  TV program |Media Watch ''.<ref name=""autogenerated1""></ref> Editor at the time, Campbell Reid, responded by accusing ''Media Watch'''s host of having a conflict of interest that ""destroyed the credibility of any judgement he could pass on the ethics and standards of others in the media"".  ===Press Council complaint regarding Greens article=== In May 2011, ''The Telegraph'' published an article making an assertion about the Australian Greens which subsequently prompted a complaint to the [[Australian Press Council . The article asserted that the Greens had managed to ""force"" the Government to divert money from flood relief, to fund various Green programs. The Press Council upheld the complaint and stated that the assertion was inaccurate and remained uncorrected.  ===Press Council complaint regarding series of misleading NBN articles=== In June and July 2011, ''The Telegraph'' published a series of articles about the [[National Broadband Network . These articles triggered a complaint to the [[Australian Press Council , alleging that they were factually incorrect, unbalanced and misleading. In December 2011, the Press Council upheld the complaints on all three articles, forcing The Telegraph to publish the adjudication. The Council also published the following statement in regards to the issue:   ===Press Council complaint regarding Mark Latham article  Sunday Telegraph === In December 2011, ''The Sunday Telegraph'' published two articles about former Labor leader Mark Latham and an alleged argument he had with his child's swimming teacher. Mr Latham complained to the [[Australian Press Council  that there was a conflict of interest which should have been disclosed as the reporter was the daughter of one of the swim teachers at the school. Mr Latham also complained that the articles breached the privacy of his family, especially his young children, and were not in the public interest. The Press Council upheld the complaint and published the following statement  extract only :  The Council also found that there had been an ""unreasonable intrusion on the children's privacy"" and upheld that aspect of the complaint.  ===Press Council complaint regarding asylum seeker article=== In November 2011, ''The Telegraph'' published an article about asylum seekers with the front-page heading 'OPEN THE FLOODGATES – Exclusive: Thousands of boat people to invade NSW'. Another headline stated 'Detainee Deluge for Sydney'. This prompted a complaint to the [[Australian Press Council , which was upheld. The Press Council published the following statement  extract only :   ===Press Council complaint regarding series of Clover Moore articles=== Throughout 2011, ''The Telegraph'' published 17 articles about Sydney Lord Mayor and MP Clover Moore. The articles prompted a complaint to the [[Australian Press Council . The complainant argued that the articles provided unbalanced coverage and that many of the headlines and phrases were opinion rather than fact. The Press Council upheld the complaint in part and published the following statement  extract only :  This adjudication marked the 4th complaint to have been upheld against ''The Daily Telegraph'' under the editorship of Paul Whittaker, since commencing the role in April 2011.  ===Photoshopping of Mike Carlton onto Boston bombing victim=== Following the resignation of Fairfax commentator [[Mike Carlton , ''The Daily Telegraph'' published a 2-page spread attacking Carlton and competing newspaper the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald ''. The spread included a composited image of [[Boston Marathon bombing  victim James Costello, with Mr Carlton's face and wearing an Arab headdress. The photoshopped image portrayed Carlton 'escaping Gaza'. The image manipulation drew widespread criticism on social media, and forced the editor to apologise, saying he was unaware of the origin of the image.  ==Counterparts== On Sundays, its counterpart is ''[[The Sunday Telegraph  Sydney |The Sunday Telegraph ''.  Its [[Melbourne  counterparts are the ''[[Herald Sun '' and ''[[Sunday Herald Sun ''.

A [[Roy Morgan Research|Roy Morgan  media credibility survey found that 40 per cent of journalists viewed News Limited newspapers as Australia's most partisan media outlet, ahead of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation  on 25 per cent. The survey found that readers took a generally dim view of journalists. In response to the question ""Which newspapers do you believe do not accurately and fairly report the news?"", the ''Daily Telegraph'' came third  9%  behind the ''Herald Sun''  11%  and ""All of them""  16% .  At the [[Australian federal election, 2007  ''The Daily Telegraph'' for only the second time endorsed the [[Australian Labor Party .

903,Y,standard.net,"     The '''''Standard-Examiner''''' is a daily morning newspaper published in [[Ogden, Utah , United States. With roughly 30,000 subscribers on Sunday and 25,000 daily, it is the third largest daily newspaper in terms of circulation in Utah, after ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune '' and the ''[[Deseret News ''. It was acquired by Sandusky Newspapers, Inc. of [[Sandusky, Ohio , on March 23, 1993.  ==History== The ''Standard-Examiner'' is Utah’s 3rd largest daily news source, serving [[Weber County, Utah|Weber , [[Davis County, Utah|Davis , [[Box Elder County, Utah|Box Elder  and [[Morgan County, Utah|Morgan  counties for over 128 years. Every week, over 200,000 area residents read ''Standard-Examiner'' through print, online and mobile formats to stay informed on happenings in their local community and throughout the world.  The ''Standard-Examiner'' traces its roots to Jan. 1, 1888, when the first edition of the ''Ogden Standard'' rolled off the presses. In a small city that was tough on newspapers, it persevered. But in 1904, it met competition from the ''Ogden Examiner''.  For 16 years, the ''Standard'' — owned by William Glasmann — and the ''Examiner'' sparred for readership. But on April 1, 1920, the two competitors merged, creating the ''Standard-Examiner''.  For more than two generations, the ''Standard-Examiner'' kept its offices in the Kiesel Building, just west of 24th Street  [[Utah State Route 53|SR-53   and Washington Boulevard  [[U.S. Route 89 in Utah|US-89  . In 1961, the newspaper moved to 455 23rd Street, where it would remain for 39 years.  During that time the newspaper, still owned by Glasmann's descendants, was sold to the Ohio-based Sandusky Newspaper Group. It is the largest-circulation newspaper owned by SNG.  In 2000, the ''Standard-Examiner'' moved to [[Defense Depot Ogden#Business Depot Ogden|Business Depot Ogden , a business park that had once been [[Defense Depot Ogden . Besides new offices, a new $10 million printing press was installed. Historically an evening newspaper, the ''Standard-Examiner'' also switched to morning publication that year.  The ''Standard-Examiner'' reorganized its newsroom in August 2015 around a Real Time Desk, which breaks news online, curates standard.net and engages readers on social media.  In April 2018, the ''[[Daily Herald  Utah |Provo Daily Herald '' announced that it was buying ''Standard-Examiner''.  In Mid-2018, The Ogden Newspapers Company Bought out most of the Ogden Standard Examiner   ==Top of Utah== The ""Top of Utah"" is used to refer to the ""northern part of the [[Utah|Beehive State , Davis, Weber, Box Elder, Morgan, [[Cache County, Utah|Cache , and [[Rich County, Utah|Rich  counties.""<ref name=""Top of Utah.com""></ref> This term was coined by ''Standard-Examiner'' publisher Scott Trundle in the mid-1990s<ref name=""Top of Utah.com""/> and used, as in a December 31, 2000, ''Ogden Standard-Examiner'' editorial, as ""the six-county Top of Utah region.""  ==Online archive== The [[J.

The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The website serves to facilitate petitions by the general public.  Previously corporations including [[Virgin America , and organizations such as [[Amnesty International  and the [[Humane Society of the United States|Humane Society , paid the site to host and promote their petitions. Change.org's stated mission is to ""empower people everywhere to create the change they want to see."" Popular topics of Change.org petitions are economic and criminal [[justice , [[human rights , [[education , [[environmental protection , [[animals rights , [[health , and [[Sustainability|sustainable food .  ==History== Change.org was launched in 2007 by current chief executive [[Ben Rattray , with the support of founding [[chief technology officer  Mark Dimas, Darren Haas,<ref name=""Veneziani""></ref> and [[Adam Cheyer .<ref name=""Veneziani""/> As of February 2012, the site had 100 employees with offices on four continents. By the end of 2012, Rattray stated ""he plans to have offices in 20 countries and to operate in several more languages, including Arabic and Chinese."" In May 2013, the company announced a $15 million round of investment led by Omidyar Network and said it has 170 staff members in 18 countries.  In 2011, Change.org claimed it was the subject of a [[distributed denial of service  attack by ""Chinese hackers"", and that the alleged attack was apparently related to its petition to the [[government of China|Chinese government  to release artist [[Ai Weiwei . In 2011, there was a proposal to merge the Spanish-speaking counterpart website ''Actuable'' into ''Change.org''. It took place in 2012 when they approved the voluntary union of ''Actuable'' users into the ''Change.org'' platform.  In 2012, [[Arizona State University  decided to block access to Change.org in response to a petition created by student Eric Haywood protesting ""rising tuition costs at the school"". University officials claimed that ""Change.org is a spam site"" and the blocking was conducted ""to protect the use of our limited and valuable network resources for legitimate academic, research, and administrative uses"".<ref name=""huffpost""></ref>  It was reported on April 5, 2012, that Change.org hit 10 million members, and was the fastest-growing social action platform on the web. At that time, they were receiving 500 new petitions per day. On May 13, 2012, ''[[The Guardian '', [[BBC News  and other sources reported that Change.org would launch a UK-specific platform for petitions, placing Change.org in competition with [[38 Degrees , a British not-for-profit political-activism organization.  An August 2013 ''[[Fast Company  magazine |Fast Company 's'' article reported that Change.org would soon begin featuring petition recipients, saying, ""For the first time, companies will be able to post a public response to any given petition  currently, they can only respond to the person who started the campaign . They will also be able to create their own Decision Maker page, which will show all petitions against them, the number of signatures gathered, and their statuses.""  In summer 2017, a petition on change.org called for [[/r/incels   incel named after an abbreviation for ""[[inceldom|involuntary celibate ""  to be banned for inciting violence against women.  ==Notable petitions==  === United States=== In December 2011, a fourth-grade class in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline , [[Massachusetts , launched the ""Lorax Petition Project"" through Change.org requesting [[Universal Studios  to include more of an environmental message on its website and trailer for its upcoming film, ''[[The Lorax  film |The Lorax '', a classic [[Dr. Seuss  children's story. The website and trailer lacked the important message from the book, ""to help the environment"". The petition collected over 57,000 signatures, and on January 26, 2012, the studio updated the website ""with the environmental message the kids had requested"".  On the morning of February 2, 2012, Stef Gray, a 23-year-old graduate in New York, held a news conference at the Washington offices of Sallie Mae where she presented the results of her Change.org, [[Sallie Mae , the ""nation's largest private student-loan provider"" petition, which had received about 77,000 signers. That afternoon the company changed its forbearance fee policy.  In November 2013, someone calling himself ""[[John Doe "" of [[Arlington, Texas  launched a petition against changes made to the [[YouTube  commenting system by [[Google . The changes force YouTube users to create an account on [[Google+  and also removes the ""reply"" mechanism on comments unless they were posted on Google+. This petition received over 100,000 signatures in less than a week, and over 200,000 within two weeks. The petition garnered more than 241,000 signatures, but failed to change Google's stance on the matter. However, the changes to YouTube did not have the intended effect &ndash; namely, increasing spam instead of curbing it &ndash; and in mid-2015, the commenting system was altered to allow users to post comments without signing into Google+.  In November 2013, Aaron Thompson from [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama  started a petition, directed at Seth MacFarlane to bring back Brian Griffin on the TV series ''[[Family Guy '', after he was briefly killed off in the Season 12 episode ""[[Life of Brian  Family Guy |Life Of Brian "". Thompson's petition gained 30,000 signatures within 36 hours. The character was brought back to the show a few episodes later.  In September 2014, Karol Wilcox of [[Hayti, Missouri  started a petition against the planned execution of Beau, a two-and-a-half-year-old dog in [[Dyersburg, Tennessee , for allegedly killing a duck on his owner's property. By November, this petition had gained over 540,000 signatures. The petition worked and the dog was spared.  After the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election , in which [[Donald Trump  was declared [[President-elect of the United States , there were [[Protests against Donald Trump|mass protests . As part of these protests, one California man started a change.org petition on November 10, 2016, which called for electors in states that Trump won to become [[faithless elector s and cast their vote for [[Hillary Clinton  instead at state [[Electoral College  United States |Electoral College  meetings. The petition acquired over 4 million signatures by November 14, 2016, only 4 days after it started.<ref name=""14 November 2016 Signature Count""></ref> By November 23, 2016, it had gotten 4.5 million signatures. The petition ultimately failed as, on December 19, 2016, Trump officially gained the presidency with 304 electors. The petition closed with 4.9 million signatures, the highest in change.org history, until March 5, 2019, when it was surpassed by a petition opposing the Article 13 of the proposed [[Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market . <ref name=EFF2019Feb></ref>  On November 3, 2017, following [[sexual assault  claims made against actor [[Kevin Spacey , [[Netflix  fired the actor from, and stalled the production of, the sixth and final season of the television series in which Spacey had starred in on the network, ''[[House of Cards  U.S. TV series |House of Cards ''.<ref name=""suspended""></ref> Following Spacey's dismissal, a petition created on November 2, 2017, calling for Spacey to be replaced by actor [[Kevin James  as a post-plastic surgery Frank Underwood began gaining a rapid number of supporters; this petition has gained media notability since its inception, gaining 50,000 supporters within eight days.  In wake of the [[Logan Paul suicide video controversy , user ""... - .- -.-- .- .-.. .. ...- .""  ""stayalive"" in [[Morse code   created a petition entitled “Delete Logan Paul’s YouTube Channel"", having received more than 520,000 signatures as of 15 January 2018. While numerous other petitions have been created for the same purpose, none have received as much attention.  === India === On 17 February 2019, trustee of  ""The Nationalist Indian""   started a campaign to abolish [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|Article 370  of the Indian Constitution is a 'temporary provision' which grants special autonomous status to [[Jammu and Kashmir|Jammu & Kashmir . The Petition gained 150,000 signatures within 24 hours, making it the fastest growing petition in India. The Nationalist Indian raised voice that ""Article 370 has been the biggest impediment to integration of J&K State into Indian Union"".  === United Kingdom=== On 10 March 2015, the political blogger Guido Fawkes, whose real name is [[Paul Staines , started a petition to reinstate [[Jeremy Clarkson , [[BBC  co-host of TV series ''[[Top Gear  2002 TV series |Top Gear ''. This followed the BBC's decision to suspend him over a ""fracas"" involving a producer on the show. The petition gained over 500,000 signatures within 24 hours, making it the fastest growing petition to date for the site, while having the servers at Change.org in the UK regularly become unresponsive due to the high demand. It had gained over 1,000,000 signatures by 20 March 2015 and it was delivered to the BBC.  === Canada=== In August 2014, Erica Perry from [[Vancouver , [[British Columbia|BC , started a petition asking [[Centerplate , a large food and beverage corporation serving entertainment venues in North America and the UK, to fire its then-CEO Desmond ""Des"" Hague after the public release of security camera footage allegedly showing Hague abusing a young [[Doberman Pinscher  in an elevator. In response to Centerplate not taking action after the incident other than releasing a statement of apology from Hague, and an agreement by Hague to commit to perform certain charitable acts, the petition called for Centerplate to fire Hague. On September 2, 2014, after the petition had received over 190,000 signatures, Hague resigned from his position as CEO of Centerplate.  On April 29, 2018, two nights after the release of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War '', Ryan Leger from [[Bolton, Ontario  started a petition for [[Marvel Studios  to extend [[Mark Ruffalo 's contract for him to appear in an ''[[The Incredible Hulk  film #Future|Incredible Hulk 2 '' and for [[Universal Pictures  to let [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Disney  have the distribution rights to any potential post-''[[Avengers: Endgame|Avengers 4 '' [[Hulk  films and Disney, in return, give Universal, for each, a marquee credit  including placement of the studio's [[Production logo|opening logo   and 8-9% of the profits as they have for [[Paramount Pictures  with ''[[The Avengers  2012 film |The Avengers '' and ''[[Iron Man 3 ''.  === France=== In February 2016, 50 petitions have exceeded 100,000 signatories.<ref name=""Les Echos""></ref> A petition against the ""[[El Khomri law|Loi El Khomri "", a labor law project by the French Labor Minister [[Myriam El Khomri  has over 1 million signatures.  === Philippines=== The petition to have death row convict [[Mary Jane Veloso  released was the fastest ever growing petition from the [[Philippines  with over 250,000 signatories from over 125 countries.  === Australia=== In 2018 an anonymous creator of a Facebook community built on hatred for people riding bikes started a Change.org anti-cycling petition that has grown in a short time to reach over 100,000 signatures. Allegedly, there is evidence many of the names on the petition are fake.   In 2019, a petition directed towards the Australian government to remove Senator [[Fraser Anning  from the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Federal Parliament  after his comments on the [[Christchurch mosque shootings|terrorist attack  in [[Christchurch , [[New Zealand . Anning blamed immigration laws, the victims and heightening fears of [[Muslims  for the attack. The petition  as at 10:11 AM UTC on 24 March 2019  has 1,418,105 signatures, making it one of the most signed petitions on Change.org, and the highest concerning Australian affairs.  === Mexico=== After two earthquakes hit Central Mexico on [[2017 Chiapas earthquake|September 7th  and [[2017 Central Mexico earthquake|September 19th , 2017, there were different petitions to force the ""[[Instituto Nacional Electoral ""  ''National Electoral Institute'' , the [[Mexican Senate , and President [[Enrique Peña Nieto  to donate most or all of the money destined for the upcoming [[Mexican general election, 2018|2018 general elections  be redirected to victims of the natural disaster in Mexico City and neighbor states of [[Morelos , [[Chiapas , [[Oaxaca , and [[Puebla . All petitions together sum the number of more than 3 million signatures.  ==Business model== Change.org makes revenue through a subscription membership model, people promoting petitions on the site, and crowdfunding.  Change.org members contribute monthly to sustain the technology and the small teams of campaigners who coach and support petition starters. The majority of the company's revenue is advertising - individuals and organisations who start or sign petitions then chip in to promote those petitions to other site visitors.  To date, Change.org has raised $50 million to fuel its growth from mission-aligned investors in business, technology and the media. In 2017 an investment round driven by [[Reid Hoffman  helped drive the shift to the current business model.  The website previously made revenue by running advertisements called sponsored campaigns for advocacy organizations such as [[Amnesty International   and list-building services to partner organizations. In May 2013 the website started ""crowd-promoted petitions"" that allowed a signatory to promote the petition by paying $5 to $1000 at the final stage of petition signing.  ==Criticism==  ===Fake signatures=== In 2018, Anne Savage, the CEO of Bicycle Queensland, claimed that a massive Australian–based anti-cycling petition on Change.org was full of false names. She said Bicycle Queensland had received information that many of the names were created by electronic “bots”. A spokesperson for Change.org denied that the signatures were fake, saying that the organisation’s engineering team had double-checked the petition and confirmed they had not detected any unusual activity.  ===Visibility of personal information=== Under certain conditions, signatures and other private information including email addresses can be found by search engines. Change.org operates a system for signature hiding, which works only if the user has an account on Change.org. Conversely, the platform has been criticized for not providing enough information on who has signed a petition; for instance a means of verifying that a petition protesting a politician has been signed by his or her constituents or that the signatures are genuine at all.  ===Corporate structure=== There has been debate and criticism<ref name=""changebiz""></ref> around the fact that Change.org is a for-profit business despite using the [[.org  domain suffix rather than the commercial [[.com . The site has been accused of fooling its users and hiding the fact that it is ""a for-profit entity that has an economic incentive to get people to sign petitions"".    Change.org spokesperson Charlotte Hill countered this criticism in a September 2013 article in ''[[Wired Magazine|Wired '', saying, ""We are a mission-driven social enterprise, and while we bring in revenue, we reinvest 100% of that revenue back into our mission of empowering ordinary people. It's not just that we're not yet making a profit – it's that we are decidedly not for-profit.""   ===Advertising policy=== In 2012, the site dropped most of the restrictions it previously placed on paid content. Internal documents began referring to ""clients"" and ""partners"" as ""advertisers"" and stated that ""only advertisers strictly identified as 'hate groups' are to be banned.""<ref name=""kos""></ref><ref name=""karoli""></ref> As a result, Change.org was accused of encouraging [[astroturfing  and abandoning the progressive user base from which it initially gained traction. Additional controversy arose when the employee who initially leaked the documents was fired.<ref name=""karoli"" /> Of the users who lost interest in the site after this change, a number of them expressed difficulty in being removed from Change.org mailing lists.<ref name=""kos"" />  ===Selling of personal data=== Change.org has also been accused of selling the personal data provided by the users to third-party companies that hire its services, gaining money at the expense of the users.<ref name=""changebiz""/>  ===Use for trending topics=== Topics for Change.org petitions have grown to include disagreement with the [[Academy Awards  and removing milk from certain types of coffee. The authors of these petitions have been criticized for focusing on [[first world problems . Further debate over the content of petitions came in November 2014 when [[Martin Daubney  called some of them ""bizarre"" and stated that the site was being used to promote censorship. In response, the Change.org communication director John Coventry defended the wide range of petitions, saying that ""people make an informed choice in what they want to support."" The following week saw criticism alleging that petitions about the media receive more attention than petitions about ""saving 'actual' lives.""  ==See also== <!--alphabetically-->  * [[Avaaz  * [[Care2  * [[GetUp!  * [[Slacktivism  * [[SumOfUs  * [[We the People  petitioning system |We the People  – Whitehouse.gov petition website * [[UK Parliament petitions website|UK Parliament petitions  - UK Government petition website  ==References==   ==External links==  *   [[Category:2007 establishments in the United States  [[Category:American political blogs  [[Category:Internet-based activism  [[Category:Internet properties established in 2007  [[Category:Online petitions  [[Category:Politics and technology  [[Category:Technology in society  [[Category:Benefit corporations  [[Category:Social networks for social change ","Change.org is a petition website operated by for-profit Change.org, Inc., an American certified B corporation which claims to have over 240 million users and hosts sponsored campaigns for organizations.

In October 2007, the magazine tried the ""[[Radiohead "" [[Radiohead#In Rainbows, independent work and ""pay what you want""  2005–08 |experiment , offering new and current [[Subscription business model|subscribers  the ability to pay what they wanted for a one-year subscription to ''Paste''.<ref name="":0"" /> The subscriber base increased by 28,000,  but ''Paste'' president Tim Regan-Porter noted the model was not sustainable; he hoped the new subscribers would renew the following year at the current rates, and the increase in web traffic would attract additional subscribers and [[Advertising|advertisers .  Amidst an economic downturn, ''Paste'' began to suffer from lagging ad revenue, as did other magazine publishers in 2008 and 2009.<ref name="":0"" /> On May 14, 2009, ''Paste'' editors announced a plan to save the magazine, by pleading to its readers, musicians and celebrities for contributions. Cost-cutting by the magazine did not stem the losses. The main crux cited for the financial troubles is the lack of advertiser spending.<ref name="":0"" />  In 2009, ''Paste'' launched an hour-long TV pilot for [[Halogen TV  called ''Pop Goes the Culture''.  On August 31, 2010, ''Paste'' suspended the print magazine, but continues publication as the online PasteMagazine.com.<ref name="":0"" />  ==Reemergence== From 2011-2016, ''Paste'' offered a digital subscription service, covering music, movies, TV, comedy, books, video games, design, tech, food and drink. Each issue included a digital version of the Paste Sampler with seven new songs each week. In 2017, Paste launched a new, large-format print magazine with an accompanying vinyl sampler. Initially planned as a quarterly, it now plans to release it annually. However, the 2018 issue was not delivered to subscribers.  ==Content== Its tagline is ""Signs of Life in Music, [[Film  and [[Culture "". ''Paste'''s initial focus was music, covering a variety of genres with an emphasis on [[adult album alternative , [[Americana  music |Americana  and [[indie rock , along with [[independent film  and [[book s. Each issue originally included a [[compact disc|CD  music sampler but was dropped in favor of digital downloading as a [[Environmentalism|Going-Green  initiative. Featured artists included [[Paul McCartney , [[Ryan Adams , [[Blackalicious ,  [[Regina Spektor , [[The Whigs  band |The Whigs , [[Fiona Apple , [[The Decemberists , [[Mark Heard , [[Woven Hand , ''Milton and the Devils Party'', [[Liam Finn , [[The Trolleyvox , and [[Thom Yorke . Many of these artists also contributed to the Campaign to Save ''Paste''.  ''Paste'' added videogames coverage in 2006, and has since expanded to include television, comedy, comic books, drinks  primarily craft beer  and, most recently, politics.  ==The Paste Studio== Paste has been recording live performances since 2006, first in its office in Decatur, Ga., and then in its Manhattan studio location beginning in 2012. Artists who've performed in the Paste studio include [[Steve Martin , [[Waka Flocka Flame , [[Violent Femmes , [[Minus the Bear , [[Flogging Molly , [[The Civil Wars , [[Chris Thile , [[Dashboard Confessional , [[The Zombies , [[Laura Marling , [[Puddles Pity Party , [[Arrested Development  group |Arrested Development  and [[Grace VanderWaal . Paste has also filmed exclusive performances at events across the country, including [[The Lumineers , [[Billy Bragg , [[Courtney Barnett , and [[Lord Huron  at [[SXSW ; [[Old Crow Medicine Show , [[Frank Turner , [[Of Monsters and Men , and [[Deer Tick  band |Deer Tick  at the [[Newport Folk Festival ; and [[Jason Isbell , [[Cold War Kids , and [[Elle King  at [[CMJ .  In 2015, Paste added several collections of archival live audio and video to PasteMagazine.com and now boasts more than 100,000 performances available to stream for free on its site or the Paste Music & Daytrotter app, launched in late 2017. Available content includes performances from Prince, U2, The Rolling Stones, Aretha Franklin, The Zephyr Bones, Wilco, Radiohead and thousands more, along with everything recorded in the Paste Studio.  ==Awards== In 2005, ''Paste'' was listed at #21 on the ''[[Chicago Tribune '''s list of ""50 Best Magazines""; it appeared on the list again in 2007. ''Paste'' was also named ""Magazine of the Year"" by the [[PLUG Independent Music Awards  in 2006, 2007 and 2008. In 2008, 2009 and 2010, ''Paste'' was nominated for a National Magazine Award in the category of General Excellence, and in 2010, associate editor Rachael Maddux' writings were nominated for Best Reviews.  ==References==   ==External links== *     [[Category:2002 establishments in Georgia  U.S. state   [[Category:2010 disestablishments in Georgia  U.S. state   [[Category:American online magazines  [[Category:American quarterly magazines  [[Category:Defunct magazines of the United States  [[Category:Entertainment magazines  [[Category:Magazines established in 2002  [[Category:Magazines disestablished in 2010  [[Category:Magazines published in Georgia  U.S. state   [[Category:Online magazines with defunct print editions  [[Category:American music magazines ","Paste is a monthly music and entertainment digital magazine, headquartered in Decatur, Georgia, with  studios in Manhattan and Davenport, Iowa, and owned by Wolfgang's Vault.

''The Wire''s founding is construed to be a result of, and reaction to, a political environment that has discouraged dissent against the present [[India n ruling [[BJP  party.<ref name="":2"" />  == Lawsuits == === Anil Ambani’s Reliance === Anil Ambani’s Reliance Infrastructure has sued The Wire for Rs 6,000 crore in Ahmedabad city civil court for an online video show on the controversial Rafale deal.<ref name=""Wire_lawsuit""></ref>  The video discussion –titled ‘Rafale Deal: Understanding the Controversy’ – was published on August 23, 2018. The discussion included senior defence journalist Ajai Shukla and The Wire’s M.K. Venu as participants, with national security analyst Happymon Jacob anchoring the show.  The lawsuit has been filed against The Wire’s founding editors and Shukla.  The Reliance Group and Anil Ambani feel that the said program is “false” and that statements made during the discussion are “wholly incorrect and misleading, made with a deliberate pre-determined motive to harm and injure the reputation” of both the company and its chairman.  === Rajeev Chandrasekhar === Indian [[Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha|Member of Parliament  Rajya Sabha   for the ruling [[Bharatiya Janata Party|Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP   and venture capitalist [[Rajeev Chandrasekhar  accused ''The Wire'' of conspiring against him with the country's main opposition, the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party , after the website published two articles suggesting that Chandrasekhar's major investments in the Indian media and defense industries might represent conflicts of interest with his role as a legislator.<ref name="":3""></ref><ref name="":4""></ref> Chandrasekhar subsequently filed suit in a [[Bangalore|Bangalore  civil court, alleging that ''The Wire''s coverage of him was defamatory.<ref name="":3"" /> On March 2, 2017 the court passed an [[Ex parte|ex-parte  [[injunction , ordering ''The Wire'' to block access to the two allegedly defamatory articles: 'Arnab's Republic, Modi's Ideology' by Sandeep Bushan and 'In Whose Interests Do Our Soldiers March?' by Sachin Rao.<ref name="":3"" /><ref name="":4"" /> Though ''The Wire'' removed both articles from its site, it has decided to challenge the court order.<ref name="":3"" /><ref name="":4"" />  === Jay Shah === [[Bharatiya Janata Party   BJP  chief [[Amit Shah ’s son Jay Shah filed a criminal defamation case against the editors of ''The Wire'' for printing an article titled 'The Golden Touch of Jay Amit Shah'. A BJP-led coalition had formed the government at the centre following their win in the [[Indian general election, 2014|2014 Indian general election , and [[Narendra Modi  had become the Prime Minister. The article alluded to possible irregularities in Jay Shah's business dealings, claiming that the turnover of a company owned by him increased 16,000 times over in the year following the election.  Jay Shah filed the case in court 13 of the Ahmedabad Metropolitan Magistrate against four editors/reporters of ''The Wire''. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate SK Gadhvi ordered a court inquiry into the matter under CrPC section 202 to inquire into the case to decide whether or not there is sufficient ground for a case to be filed. Observing that “prima facie it seems there is a case” against ''The Wire'' for its defamatory article against Shah, a metropolitan court issued summons to the reporter of the article and editors of the website to appear before it on November 13 in the criminal defamation case filed against them. The order also mentions Shah's contention that “the news portal didn’t give enough time to him to send his response, the article didn’t include the loss incurred by his company in the year 2015-2016, and created confusion over the turnover to defame him.”  The Ahmedabad civil court on 23 December vacated the ex parte and interim injunction. The court lifted all restrictions except the use of words  after  “Narendra Modi becoming Prime Minister/elected as Prime Minister.” ''The Wire'' called the lifting of the injunction a “victory for The Wire”, and that the “decision by the civil court is a vindication of ''The Wire''s fundamental stand that its article had been a legitimate exercise of the freedom of expression in the public interest.” However, the [[Gujarat High court|Gujarat High Court  later reinstated the gag order and refused to quash the criminal defamation case filed by Jay Shah. ''The Wire'' had appealed in the [[Supreme Court of India  against this order. The [[Supreme Court of India  asked the Gujarat trial court not to proceed till April 12 with the criminal defamation complaint. Later, [[Chief Justice of India  [[Dipak Misra  listed the matter to be heard on April 18 by a different bench of the Supreme Court. However, the bench had not been specified.  == References ==    [[Category:Indian news websites  [[Category:2015 establishments in India ","The Wire is a news website published by the Foundation for Independent Journalism  FIJ , a non-profit Indian company.

Topics include British, European, and US politics, social issues, art, literature, cinema, science, the media, history, philosophy, and psychology. It features a mixture of lengthy analytic articles, first-person reportage, one-page columns, and shorter, quirky items.  The magazine was launched in October 1995 by [[David Goodhart , then a senior correspondent for the ''[[Financial Times '', and chairman Derek Coombs. Goodhart came up with the idea of producing an essay-based monthly general interest magazine—a form then unknown in Britain—while covering German reunification as Bonn correspondent for the ''FT''.  Contributors  include [[Lionel Shriver , [[A. C. Grayling , [[Gordon Brown , [[Mohamed ElBaradei , [[Michael Lind , [[Michael Ignatieff , [[Geoff Dyer , [[Francis Fukuyama , [[Roger Scruton , [[Andrew Marr , [[John Kay  economist |John Kay , and [[J. M. Coetzee . Notable features of the magazine include head-to-head debates between two writers with opposing views on a subject; roundtable discussions, in which a series of experts with varying views on a given topic meet for a discussion, an edited transcript of which is published in the magazine; and interviews with major political and cultural figures  examples include [[Orhan Pamuk , [[Paul Wolfowitz , and [[Hilary Mantel  .   ''Prospect'' received worldwide attention in October 2005 when it published its list of the world's top 100 public intellectuals, which included [[Noam Chomsky , [[Umberto Eco , [[Richard Dawkins , [[Steven Pinker  and [[Christopher Hitchens . The magazine asked readers to vote for their top intellectual from the longlist; Chomsky was the eventual winner. Subsequent lists have continued to attract attention. Dawkins claimed the top spot in 2013.  ''Prospect'' has also published the winning [[short story  of the [[Royal Society of Literature 's V. S. Pritchett Memorial Prize since 2009.  == Policy positions == The magazine prizes independence over [[ideology  and its articles and authors span the political spectrum. It tends to avoid a ""line"" on specific policy issues. Perhaps its strongest leaning is ""[[contrarian ""—it devotes much space to articles debunking the ""popular wisdom"", on topics ranging from Japan's alleged economic crisis to the [[Mahdi army  in Iraq. However, it has been described as left-leaning by the BBC,<ref name=""bbc""></ref> and the ''Prospect'' contributor [[Roger Scruton .<ref name=""spectator""></ref>  In August 2009 in a roundtable interview in ''Prospect'', [[Adair Turner  supported the idea of new global taxes on financial transactions, warning that a ""swollen"" financial sector paying excessive salaries has grown too big for society. Turner's suggestion that a ""[[Tobin tax ""—named after the economist [[James Tobin —should be considered for financial transactions drew international attention.  In recent years the magazine's founding editor, [[David Goodhart , has stirred controversy with a series of articles arguing that the increasing diversity of the United Kingdom may weaken the bonds of solidarity on which the welfare state depends. The debate fed into the broader discussions of ""[[Britishness "" that have become increasingly common in the public sphere.  == The Think Tank Awards == ''Prospect'' holds the annual [https://web.archive.org/web/20120626180350/http://www.thinktankawards.com/ Think Tank Awards], which celebrate and reward the work of [[think tank s on a national and global scale. The awards are supported by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell . Categories include 'Global Think Tank of the Year', 'Publication of the Year', 'North American Think Tank of the Year', 'European Think Tank of the Year'  excluding Britain , 'UK Think Tank of the Year', and many sub-categories for the UK. According to the official website, ""The awards are judged by a cross-party panel looking for evidence of influence on public policy and on the public discourse. The judges will also consider the quality of research and potential of younger and smaller organisations."" The awards have been running since 2001, and have been expanding exponentially to include more global awards for international Think Tanks. The winner of the most recent 2017 Think Tank awards  held at the [[Institute of Directors  on 10 July  was the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation , based in the UK, for its ""very strong analytical appraisal of social conditions in Britain"".

Most of its content consists of rebuttals to what it considers inaccurate, [[disinformation|misleading , or false claims made by politicians. FactCheck.org has also targeted misleading claims from various partisan groups. Other features include: * Ask FactCheck: users can ask questions that are usually based on an online rumor. * Viral Spiral: a page dedicated to the most popular online myths that the site has debunked. It clarifies the answer as well as links readers to a full article on the subject. * Party Lines: talking points that have been repeatedly used by multiple members of a political party. * Mailbag: page for readers' sent letters and praise or disapproval of something said on the site.  ==History== FactCheck.org was launched in December 2003 by Brooks Jackson, a former [[Associated Press , [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal , and [[CNN  reporter who had covered Washington and national politics since 1970. As a special assignment correspondent at CNN during the 1992 political campaign season, Jackson became well known for his “Ad Police” reports, which monitored candidates' advertising and financing strategies throughout the campaign. In 2003, [[Kathleen Hall Jamieson  of the Annenberg Public Policy Center approached Jackson about forming FactCheck.org, and the site was online in December of that year.  In 2007, ''UnSpun'' was published. This book was co-written by Brooks Jackson, the Director Emeritus of Factcheck.org and by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the Director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. It teaches readers how to be aware of the deceptions, or ""spin"", that is commonly used in media and by politicians.  In January 2013, Jackson stepped down as director of FactCheck.org. He now holds the title of Director Emeritus. Eugene Kiely, a former reporter and editor at [[The Record  Bergen County |The Record   of [[Hackensack, New Jersey  , [[The Philadelphia Inquirer  and [[USA Today , is now the site's director. FactCheck.org employs a staff of four full-time journalists: Kiely, D’Angelo Gore, Robert Farley and Lori Robertson; and offers yearly fellowships to undergraduate students at the University of Pennsylvania.  ==Topic in the 2004 vice-presidential debate== FactCheck.org became a focus of political commentary following the [[U.S. presidential election debates, 2004|2004 vice-presidential debate  between [[Dick Cheney  and [[John Edwards . Cheney cited the website, claiming that the independent site defended his actions while CEO of [[Halliburton . Cheney's claim was disputed by FactCheck.org as wrong, saying that ""Edwards was mostly right"" when talking about ""Cheney's responsibility for earlier Halliburton troubles"".  Cheney's reference created some controversy because he incorrectly cited the web site's address as ""FactCheck.''com''."" At the time of the debate, factcheck.com was controlled by [[Frank Schilling|Frank Schilling's  company Name Administration Inc., who quickly redirected the address to point to an anti-Bush website owned by Bush critic [[George Soros .  ==Topic in the 2012 presidential election== FactCheck.org also became a focus of national attention in the summer of 2012, during the presidential race between incumbent Democrat [[Barack Obama  and GOP challenger [[Mitt Romney . The Obama campaign ran a TV ad accusing Romney of involvement in the outsourcing of American jobs overseas by [[Bain Capital , the venture capital firm that he had founded in 1984. FactCheck.org ruled this ad to be false, claiming that the acts of outsourcing occurred after Romney had left the company to head the [[2002 Winter Olympics  in [[Salt Lake City . In response, the Obama campaign contested FactCheck.org’s ruling in a six-page letter that was distributed to major news corporations, holding that Romney still retained responsibility for the company's actions.  == 2016 presidential election == Since November 2014, FactCheck.org has published twenty-eight pages of articles checking the facts on the many [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential  candidates.  As of April 2016, the five remaining candidates had dedicated archives to their fact-checked claims.  ==Awards and recognition== The site has gained recognition and won numerous awards for its contributions to political journalism. In 2006, ''[[Time  magazine |Time '' magazine named FactCheck.org one of the ""25 Sites We Can't Live Without."" In 2008, ''[[PC Magazine '' called it one of the ""20 Best Political Websites."" Between 2008 and 2012, the site won four Webby Awards in the Politics category, in 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012; as well as four People's Voice Awards in Politics, in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012.

A French version, ''slate.fr'', was launched in February 2009 by a group of four journalists, including [[Jean-Marie Colombani , Eric Leser, and economist [[Jacques Attali . Among them, the founders hold 50 percent in the publishing company, while The Slate Group holds 15 percent. In 2011, ''slate.fr'' started a separate site covering African news, ''Slate Afrique'', with a Paris-based editorial staff.  [[Jared Hohlt  will become editor-in-chief on April 1, 2019.<ref name=""PeiserEditor""></ref>   [[Julia Turner  journalist |Julia Turner  replaced [[David Plotz  in July 2014 and resigned in October 2018.<ref name=""turnerexit"" /> Plotz had been editor of ''Slate'' since 2008<ref name=""slate2008""></ref> and deputy editor to [[Jacob Weisberg , ''Slate's'' editor from 2002 until his designation as the chairman and editor-in-chief of The Slate Group. The Washington Post Company's John Alderman is ''Slate''s publisher.  ''Slate'', which is updated throughout the day, covers politics, arts and culture, sports, and news. According to Turner, the magazine is ""not fundamentally a breaking news source,"" but rather aimed at helping readers to ""analyze and understand and interpret the world"" with witty and entertaining writing.<ref name="":0""></ref> As of mid-2015, it publishes about 1,500 stories per month.<ref name="":4""></ref>  ''Slate'' is also known  and sometimes criticized  for adopting self-described ""[[American Left|left  of center"" and [[contrarian  views, giving rise to the term ""Slate Pitches.""<ref name="":1""></ref><ref name="":2""></ref> It is ad-supported and has been available to read free of charge since 1999, but restricted access for non-US readers via a [[metered paywall  in 2015.  ==Background== ''Slate'' features regular and semi-regular columns such as ''Explainer, Moneybox, Spectator, Transport'', and ''[[Dear Prudence  advice column |Dear Prudence ''. Many of the articles are short  less than 2,000 words  and argument-driven. Around 2010, the magazine also began running long-form journalism. Many of the longer stories are an outgrowth of the ""Fresca Fellowships"", so-called because former editor Plotz liked the soft drink [[Fresca . ""The idea is that every writer and editor on staff has to spend a month or six weeks a year not doing their regular job, but instead working on a long, ambitious project of some sort,"" Plotz said in an interview.  ''Slate'' introduced a [[paywall -based business model in 1998 that attracted up 20,000 subscribers but was later abandoned.<ref name="":5""></ref> A similar subscription model was implemented in April 2001 by ''Slate''s independently owned competitor, [[Salon.com .  ''Slate'' started a daily feature ”Today's Pictures” on November 30, 2005, which featured 15-20 photographs from the archive at [[Magnum Photos  that share a common theme. The column also features two [[Flash animation|flash animated  ”Interactive Essays” a month.  [[File:Slate screenshot.png|thumb|right|The design of ''Slate''s homepage from 2006 to 2013  On its 10th anniversary, ''Slate'' unveiled a redesigned website. It introduced ''Slate V'' in 2007, an online video magazine with content that relates to or expands upon their written articles. In 2013, the magazine was redesigned under the guidance of Design Director [[Vivian Selbo .  ''Slate'' was nominated for four digital [[National Magazine Awards  in 2011 and won the [[American society of magazine editors#National Magazine Awards|NMA  for General Excellence. In the same year, the magazine laid off several high-profile journalists, including co-founder [[Jack Shafer  and [[Timothy Noah   author of the ''Chatterbox'' column .<ref name="":6""></ref> At the time, it had around 40 full-time editorial staff.<ref name="":6"" /> The following year, a dedicated ad sales team was created.  ''Slate'' launched the ""Slate Book Review"" in 2012, a monthly books section edited by Dan Kois.  The next year, ''Slate'' became profitable after preceding years had seen layoffs and falling ad revenues.<ref name="":0"" />  In 2014, ''Slate'' introduced a [[paywall system  called ""Slate Plus,"" offering ad-free podcasts and bonus materials. A year later, it had attracted 9,000 subscribers generating about $500,000 in annual revenue.<ref name="":5"" />  ''Slate'' moved all content behind a [[metered paywall  for international readers in June 2015, explaining ""our U.S.-based sales team sells primarily to domestic advertisers, many of whom only want to reach a domestic audience. ...The end result is that, outside the United States, we are not covering our costs."" At the same time, it was stated that there were no plans for a domestic paywall.<ref name="":4"" />  Slate's articles have presented news and opinions from a liberal perspective, eventually evolving into a self-proclaimed liberal news site. However, the website claims that writers use factual evidence to back up their claims.  === Reputation for counterintuitive arguments  ""Slate pitches""  === Since 2006,<ref name="":1"" /> ''Slate'' has been known for publishing [[contrarian  pieces arguing against commonly held views about a subject, giving rise to the #slatepitches Twitter [[hashtag  in 2009.<ref name="":2"" /> The ''[[Columbia Journalism Review '' has defined ''Slate'' [[Sales Pitch|pitches  as ""an idea that sounds wrong or counterintuitive proposed as though it were the tightest logic ever,"" and in explaining its success wrote ""Readers want to click on Slate Pitches because they want to know what a writer could possibly say that would support their logic"".  In 2014, ''Slate''s then editor-in-chief Julia Turner acknowledged a reputation for counterintuitive arguments forms part of ''Slate''<nowiki/>'s ""distinctive"" brand, but argued that the hashtag misrepresents the site's journalism. ""We are not looking to argue that up is down and black is white for the sake of being contrarian against all logic or intellectual rigor. But journalism is more interesting when it surprises you either with the conclusions that it reaches or the ways that it reaches them.""<ref name="":0"" />  In a 2019 article for the site, ''Slate'' contributor Daniel Engber reflected on the changes that had occurred on the site since he started writing for it 15 years previously.  He suggested that its original worldview, influenced by its founder Kinsley and described by Engber as ""feisty, surprising, debate-club centrist-by-default"" and ""liberal contrarianism"", had shifted towards ""a more reliable, left-wing slant"", whilst still giving space for heterodox opinions, albeit ""tempered by other, graver duties"". He argued that this was necessary within the context of a ""Manichean age of flagrant cruelty and corruption"", although he also acknowledged that it could be ""a troubling limitation"".  ==Podcasts==   According to NiemanLab, ''Slate'' has been involved in [[podcast s ""almost from the very beginning"" of the medium.<ref name=""NJLab"" /> Its first podcast offering, released on July 15, 2005, featured selected stories from the site read by Andy Bowers, who had joined ''Slate'' after leaving [[NPR  in 2003.<ref name=""NJLab""></ref><ref name="":3""></ref> By June 2012, ''Slate'' had expanded their lineup to 19 podcasts, with ''Political Gabfest'' and ''Culture Gabfest'' being the most popular.<ref name=""NJLab"" /> This count had shrunk to 14 by February 2015, with all receiving six million downloads per month.<ref name="":3"" /> The podcasts are ""a profitable part of [''Slate'''s] business""; the magazine charges more for advertising in its podcasts than in any of its other content.<ref name=""NJLab"" />   * ''Amicus'' – legal commentary * ''Audio Book Club'' * ''Culture Gabfest'' * ''Daily Podcast'' – some of everything * ''The Waves''  formerly ''DoubleX''  – women's issues * ''Hang Up and Listen'' – sports * ''Hit Parade'' - pop music history * ''If Then'' - technology, Silicon Valley, and tech policy * ''Lexicon Valley'' – language issues * ''Manners for the Digital Age'' * ''Mom and Dad Are Fighting'' – parenting * ''Money'' - business and finance * ''[[Slate Political Gabfest|Political Gabfest '' * ''Spoiler Specials'' – film discussion * ''[[Studio 360 '' - pop culture and the arts, in partnership with [[Public Radio International  * ''[[The Gist '' * [[Slow Burn  podcast |Slow Burn  * ''Video Podcast'' * ''Trumpcast''   ''Slate'' podcasts have gotten longer over the years.

A separate edition of the ''Register'' is sold throughout much of [[Iowa .  ==History== ===Early period=== The first newspaper in Des Moines was the ''Iowa Star''. In July 1849, Barlow Granger began the paper in an abandoned [[log cabin  by the junction of the [[Des Moines  and [[Raccoon River .<ref name=""DMR-2015""></ref>  In 1854, ''The Star'' became the ''Iowa Statesman'' which was also a Democratic paper. In 1857, ''The Statesman'' became the ''Iowa State Journal'', which published 3 times per week.<ref name=""DMR-2015""/>  In 1870, ''The Iowa Statesman'' became the ''Iowa State Leader'' as a Democratic newspaper, which competed with pro-[[Republican Party  United States |Republican  ''Iowa Daily State Register'' for the next 32 years.<ref name=""DMR-2015""/>  In 1902, George Roberts bought the ''Register'' and ''Leader'' and merged them into a morning newspaper. In 1903, Des Moines banker [[Gardner Cowles, Sr.  purchased the ''Register and Leader''. The name finally became ''The Des Moines Register'' in 1915.<ref name=""DMR-2015""/>  Cowles also acquired the ''[[Des Moines Tribune '' in 1908. The ''Tribune'', which merged with the rival ''Des Moines News'' in 1924 and the ''Des Moines Capital'' in 1927, served as the evening paper for the Des Moines area until it ended publication on September 25, 1982.   Under the ownership of the Cowles family, the ''Register'' became Iowa's largest and most influential newspaper, eventually adopting the slogan ""The Newspaper Iowa Depends Upon."" Newspapers were distributed to all four corners of the state by train and later by truck as Iowa's highway system was improving.  ===Nationwide development=== In 1906, the newspaper's first front-page [[editorial cartoon , illustrated by [[Jay Norwood Darling , was published;<ref name=""DMR-2015""/> the tradition of front-page editorial cartoons continued until December 4, 2008 when 25-year veteran cartoonist Brian Duffy was let go in a round of staff cuts.   The ''Register'' employed reporters in cities and towns throughout Iowa, and it covered national and international news stories from an Iowa perspective, even setting up its own news bureau in [[Washington, D.C.  in 1933. During the 1960s, circulation of the ''Register'' peaked at nearly 250,000 for the daily edition and 500,000 for the Sunday edition–more than the population of Des Moines at the time. In 1935, the Register & Tribune Company founded radio station [[KRNT|KRNT-AM , named after the newspapers' nickname, ""the R 'n T.""  In 1955, the company, renamed Cowles Communications some years earlier, founded Des Moines' third television station, KRNT-TV, which was renamed [[KCCI  after the radio station was sold in 1974. Cowles eventually acquired other newspapers, radio stations and television stations, but almost all of them were sold to other companies by 1985.   In 1943, the ''Register'' became the first newspaper to sponsor a statewide [[opinion poll  when it introduced the Iowa Poll, modeled after Iowan George Gallup's national [[Gallup poll . Sports coverage was increased under sports editor Garner ""Sec"" Taylor – for whom Sec Taylor Field at [[Principal Park  is named – in the 1920s. For many years the ''Register'' printed its sports sections on [[peach  color |peach -colored paper, but that tradition ended for the daily paper in 1981 and for the ''Sunday Register's'' ""Big Peach"" in 1999. Another ''Register'' tradition – the sponsorship of [[RAGBRAI  – began in 1973 when writer John Karras challenged columnist [[Donald Kaul  to do a border-to-border bicycle ride across Iowa. The liberal-leaning editorial page has brought Donald Kaul back for Sunday opinion columns. Other local columns have faded and given way to Gannett-distributed material.   In 1985, faced with declining circulation and revenues, the Cowles family sold off its various properties to different owners, with the ''Register'' going to [[Gannett .<ref name=""DMR-2015""/> At the time of sale, only ''The New York Times'' had won more Pulitzer Prizes for national reporting.   In 1990, the ''Register'' began to reduce its coverage of news outside of the Des Moines area by closing most of its Iowa news bureaus and ending carrier distribution to outlying counties, although an ""Iowa Edition"" of the ''Register'' is still distributed throughout most of the state. Many of the ''Register's'' news stories and editorials focus on Des Moines and its suburbs.   The ''Register'' opened a new printing and distribution facility on the south side of Des Moines in 2000. The news & advertising offices remained in downtown Des Moines. After 95 years in the Des Moines Register Building at 715 Locust Street, the ''Register'' announced in 2012 that they would move to a new location in 2013, settling for Capital Square three blocks to the east. On June 15, 2013, the Register moved to its new location from 715 Locust Street to 400 Locust Street.<ref name=""DMR-2015""/> In 2014, the old building has been sold for $1.6 million and will be redeveloped into a combination of apartments and retail space.  ===2013–present=== [[File:Des Moines Register Headline  01-02-2016 .jpg|thumb|right|''Des Moines Register'' in 2016  In 2018, [[China  increased the supplement in the ''Des Moines Register'', that criticized the pushback to the [[trade war . President [[Donald Trump|Trump  attacked China as the interfering in American elections. In early October, [[vice president  Pence also quoted the same example by this newspaper in Iowa.  ==Editorial philosophy== In the three decades before the Cowles family acquired the ''Register'' in 1903, the ''Register'' was a ""voice of pragmatic conservatism.""<ref name=wbf>William B.

During the Cowles family's ownership, the ''Register''s editorial page philosophy was generally more liberal in its outlook than editorial pages of other Iowa newspapers, but there were notable exceptions.

The paper was a severe critic of [[George W. Bush 's [[N.S.A. surveillance without warrants controversy|warrantless wiretapping strategy , claiming that in doing so, ""President Bush has declared war on the American people.""  In December 2007, two weeks before the 2008 Iowa caucuses, the ''Register'' endorsed [[Hillary Clinton   in the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2008|Democratic caucuses   and [[John McCain   in the [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2008|Republican caucuses  . In October 2008, the Register endorsed [[Barack Obama  for president in the general election.  In 2011, 24 days before the 2012 Iowa caucuses, the newspaper endorsed former Massachusetts Governor [[Mitt Romney  in the 2012 Republican Iowa Caucuses. The Register endorsed Romney over Obama 10 days before the general election on October 27, 2012—the first time it had supported a Republican for president since 1972.  On July 24, 2015, the newspaper announced that it had been denied press credentials to cover a [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump presidential campaign  family picnic in [[Oskaloosa, Iowa , due to an editorial the previous week which called on Trump to drop out of the race.  On January 23, 2016, the Register endorsed Republican Senator [[Marco Rubio  for the GOP nomination, and [[Hillary Clinton  as the Democratic candidate.  On October 13, 2018, the ''Register'' endorsed all Democratic candidates standing for the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections saying that Republicans have ""failed to govern.""  ==Register and Tribune Syndicate==  In 1922, Gardner Cowles' son [[John Cowles Sr.|John  launched the Register and Tribune Syndicate. At its peak, the syndicate offered other newspapers some 60 to 75 features, including editorial cartoonist [[Herblock  and commentaries by [[David Horowitz , [[Stanley Karnow , and others. The cartoons and comic strips included ''[[Spider-Man  comic strip |Spider-Man ''. [[Will Eisner 's ''[[Spirit  comics |The Spirit '' was part of a 16-page Sunday supplement known colloquially as ""The Spirit Section"". This was a [[tabloid  paper size |tabloid -sized newsprint comic book sold as part of eventually 20 Sunday newspapers with a combined circulation of as many as five million copies. The most successful comics feature was ''[[The Family Circus '', eventually distributed to more than 1,000 newspapers.

Each issue profiles what he perceives as biased or inaccurate reports about politics in the American news media. Prior to ''CyberAlert'', MRC published such reports in a monthly newsletter titled ''MediaWatch'',<ref name=""Wacky Watchdogs""></ref> from 1988 to 1999. Media analysis articles are now under the banner ''BiasAlert''.  Media analysis director Tim Graham and research director Rich Noyes regularly write ''Media Reality Check'', another MRC publication documenting alleged liberal bias. ''Notable Quotables'' is its ""collection of the most biased quotes from journalists"".<ref name=""MRC About""/> In ''Notable Quotables'', editors give honors such as the ""[[Linda Ellerbee  Awards for Distinguished Reporting"" based on the former [[CNN  commentator, who Bozell considered ""a liberal blowhard who has nothing to say"".<ref name=""Wacky Watchdogs 2""></ref> Other features on its website include the weekly syndicated news and entertainment columns written by founder Bozell.  MRC staff members have also written editorials and books about their findings of the media. Bozell has written three books about the news media: ''And That's the Way it Isn't: A Reference Guide to Media Bias''  1990, with Brent Baker ; ''[[Weapons of Mass Distortion|Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media ''  2004 ; and ''Whitewash: How The News Media Are Paving Hillary Clinton's Path to the Presidency''  2007, with Tim Graham . Research director Rich Noyes has also co-authored several published books.<ref name=""Noyes""></ref>  ===MRC Business=== In 1992, the MRC created the Free Market Project to promote the culture of free enterprise and combat what it believes is media spin on business and economic news. That division recently changed its name to the Business & Media Institute  www.businessandmedia.org  and later to MRC Business and is now focused on ""Advancing the culture of free enterprise in America."" BMI's advisory board included such well-known individuals as economists [[Walter E. Williams|Walter Williams  and [[Bruce Bartlett , as well as former [[CNN  anchor [[David Goodnow . BMI is led by career [[journalist  Dan Gainor, a former [[managing editor  at CQ.com, the website for [[Congressional Quarterly . It released a research report in June 2006 covering the portrayal of business on prime-time entertainment television during the May and November ""sweeps"" periods from 2005. The report concluded that the programs, among them the long-running [[NBC  legal drama ''[[Law & Order '', were biased against business. Another report of the BMI accused the networks of bias in favor of the [[Gardasil  vaccine, a vaccine intended to prevent [[cervical cancer .  ===CNSNews.com===  Bozell founded CNSNews.com  formerly [[Cybercast News Service   in 1998 to cover stories he believes are ignored by mainstream news organizations.  CNSNews.com provides news articles for [[Townhall.com  and other websites for a subscription fee. Its leadership consists of president Brent Bozell and editor Terry Jeffrey. Under editor David Thibault, CNSNews.com questioned the validity of the circumstances in which Democratic Rep. [[John Murtha  received his [[Purple Heart s as a response to Murtha's criticisms of the U.S. [[War in Iraq . ''[[The Washington Post '' and [[Nancy Pelosi  have commented that this approach is similar to the tactics of the [[Swift Vets and POWs for Truth , which opposed [[John Kerry 's candidacy in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 election .  ===NewsBusters=== In the summer of 2005, Media Research Center launched NewsBusters with host [[Jodi Miller , a website ""dedicated to exposing & combating liberal media bias,"" in cooperation with Matthew Sheffield, a conservative blogger involved in the CBS [[Killian documents  story. NewsBusters is styled as a rapid-response [[blog  site that contains posts by MRC editors to selected stories in mass media. Although the site is advertised chiefly as a conservative site, it frequently defends Neoconservatives as well. Not only does the site highlight journalists it deems are liberally biased, but also non-journalists  writers, musicians, producers, scientists, etc.  who they perceive have liberal viewpoint.  In addition to conventional media outlets, NewsBusters has attacked [[Wikipedia  over perceived liberal bias in its [[John Edwards  discussion pages.  ===MRC Culture===  In October 2006, the MRC created the [[Culture and Media Institute , the mission of which is ""to advance, preserve, and help restore America's culture, character, traditional values, and morals against the assault of the liberal media."" [[Robert H. Knight  was the institute's first director. MRC VP Dan Gainor is now in charge of that department. In 2018, the MRC started a new project in the Culture Department to monitor online censorship of conservatives called MRC TechWatch.  ===MRCTV=== MRC sponsors MRCTV  formerly Eyeblast , a conservative-leaning [[YouTube -like video-hosting site.  ==Viewpoints== In its mission to show that there is a ""strident liberal bias""  in the national news media, the MRC has produced a number of their own analyses and has offered as evidence the claims that news reporters use the ""conservative"" or ""Republican"" label to describe conservatives more often than they label liberals or Democrats. They have also said that when politicians are involved in scandal, their party affiliation is brought up more often when they are Republican than Democrat; for example, they have said that Senator [[Robert Packwood 's Republican affiliation was brought up in most reports about his sexual scandals, but Representative [[Gary Condit 's Democratic affiliation was ignored when he had the same problem, that the media is sympathetic to [[Communism  or ""dictators"", that media coverage of [[global warming  is biased in favor of [[environmentalism , and that the media focuses on covering the negative side of the [[Iraq War . In 1999, the MRC reported that the network news programs on ABC, CBS, and NBC largely ignored [[Chinese intelligence operations in the United States|Chinese espionage in the United States  during the [[presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration .  Beyond news media, MRC also publishes research about entertainment television. Reports it released from 1993 to 1995 claimed that such programs made more references to religion each later year, most of which became more favorable. In 2003, the MRC urged advertisers to pull sponsorship from ''[[The Reagans '', a miniseries about President [[Ronald Reagan  to be shown on [[CBS . The network later moved the program to its co-owned premium cable network [[Showtime  TV network |Showtime .  The MRC has also long been a critic of the [[video game industry , arguing that there is a [[Video game controversies|link between violent videogames and real-world violence ; in this capacity, they  along with the [[Parents Television Council , a subsidiary  were invited to President [[Donald Trump 's 2018 summit on video games and gun violence.  MRC released a report in 2007 claiming that the network morning shows devoted more airtime to covering Democratic presidential candidates than Republican ones for the 2008 election. Producers for such shows criticized the MRC's methodology as flawed. During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 US presidential election , MRC released a report that claimed that the vast majority of news stories about Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama  had a positive slant. MRC president Bozell praised MSNBC for having [[David Gregory  journalist |David Gregory  replace [[Chris Matthews  and [[Keith Olbermann  as political coverage anchor beginning September 8, 2008, but MSNBC president Phil Griffin disputed the statements by Bozell and others who have accused the network of liberal bias.  In March 2010, [[About.com  named MRC one of the top 20 conservatives to follow on [[Twitter .  Bozell was an outspoken critic of Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican primaries, describing him as ""the greatest charlatan of them all"", ""a “huckster” and “shameless self-promoter”.<ref name="":0"" /> He said, ""God help this country if this man were president.""<ref name="":0"" /> After Trump clinched the Republican nomination, Bozell attacked the media for their ""hatred"" of Trump.<ref name="":0"" /> ''Politico'' noted, ""The paradox here is that Bozell was once more antagonistic toward the president than any journalist.""<ref name="":0"" /> Bozell singled out Jake Tapper for being ""one of the worst offenders"" in coverage of Trump, however several senior MRC staff told ''Politico'' that they considered Tapper a model of fairness.<ref name="":0"" />  ==Criticism==  ''[[Extra! '', the magazine of the [[Progressivism in the United States#Contemporary progressivism|progressive  [[media watch group  [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|FAIR , criticized the MRC in 1998 for [[cherry picking  fallacy |selective use of evidence . MRC had said that there was more coverage of government [[death squads  in right-wing [[El Salvador  than in left-wing [[Nicaragua  in the 1980s, when [[Amnesty International  stated El Salvador was worse than Nicaragua when it came to extrajudicial killings. ''Extra!'' also likened a defunct MRC newsletter, ''TV etc.'', which tracked the off-screen political comments of actors, to ""''[[Red Channels '', the McCarthy Era blacklisting journal.""<ref name=""Meet the Myth-Makers""></ref>  Journalist Brian Montopoli of ''[[Columbia Journalism Review '' in 2005 labeled MRC ""just one part of a wider movement by the far right to demonize corporate media"", rather than ""make the media better.""<ref name=""CJR 2005""></ref>  On December 22, 2011, Media Research Center president Bozell appeared on [[Fox News  and suggested U.S. President [[Barack Obama  looks like a ""skinny ghetto crackhead"",<ref name=""Reuters122011""></ref> reacting to MSNBC's Chris Matthews' assertions that [[Newt Gingrich  ""looks like a car bomber"" with ""no media backlash.""  The Media Research Center has also faced scrutiny over the group's $350,000 purchase in 2012 of a Pennsylvania house that a top executive had been trying to sell for several years.   On June 31, 2013, Media Research Center president Bozell appeared on Fox News to defend a Fox interview in which Fox journalists conducted almost no research into the background of [[Reza Aslan  to prepare for its interview with him, and its putative biases.  Progressive media watchdog group [[Media Matters for America  has repeatedly criticized the MRC, charging they view the media ""through a funhouse mirror that renders everything--even the facts themselves--as manifestations of insidious bias"".<ref name=""Scrutiny""></ref>  When the Media Research Center bestowed an award named for [[William F. Buckley  to [[Sean Hannity , [[Bret Stephens  wrote a column in ''[[The New York Times '' in which he lamented, ""And so we reach the Idiot stage of the conservative cycle, in which a Buckley Award for Sean Hannity suggests nothing ironic, much less [[Orwellian , to those bestowing it, applauding it, or even shrugging it off.  The award itself is trivial, but it’s a fresh reminder of who now holds the commanding heights of conservative life, and what it is that they think.""  ==See also==  * [[Accuracy in Media  * [[Media Matters for America  * [[PR Watch   ==References==   ==Further reading== *  *  *  *  *   ==External links== * [http://www.mrc.org/ Official website] * [http://www.newsbusters.org/  MRC's official blog, NewsBusters] * [http://www.cnsnews.com/ CNSNews.com], MRC's news service * [http://www.businessandmedia.org/ Business & Media Institute] * [https://web.archive.org/web/20030402130321/http://www.timeswatch.org/ TimesWatch], an MRC project dedicated to ""documenting and exposing the liberal political agenda of ''[[The New York Times ''"" * [https://web.archive.org/web/20070121145929/http://www.cultureandmediainstitute.org/ Culture and Media Institute]  [[Category:Media analysis organizations and websites  [[Category:Political organizations in the United States  [[Category:Organizations established in 1987  [[Category:1987 establishments in Virginia  [[Category:Non-profit organizations based in Reston, Virginia  [[Category:Conservatism in the United States ","The Media Research Center  MRC  is an American nonprofit media watchdog for politically conservative content analysis based in Reston, Virginia.

""If you think we're going to have any of that upmarket shit in our paper,"" Murdoch replied dropping a sample copy into a bin, ""you're very much mistaken"".<ref name=""Brogan""/>  Lamb hastily recruited a staff of about 125 reporters, who were mostly selected for availability rather than their ability.<ref name=""ChippindaleCh1"" /> This was about a quarter of what the ''Mirror'' then employed, and Murdoch had to draft in staff on loan from his Australian papers. Murdoch immediately relaunched ''The Sun'' as a [[Tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid , and ran it as a sister paper to the ''News of the World''.<ref name=""ChippindaleCh1"" /> ''The Sun'' used the same printing presses, and the two papers were managed together at senior executive levels.  The tabloid ''Sun'' was first published on 17 November 1969, with a front page headlined ""HORSE DOPE SENSATION"", an ephemeral ""exclusive"". An editorial on page 2 announced: ""Today's ''Sun'' is a new newspaper. It has a new shape, new writers, new ideas. But it inherits all that is best from the great traditions of its predecessors. ''The Sun'' cares. About the quality of life. About the kind of world we live in. And about people"". The first issue had an ""exclusive interview"" with the Labour Prime Minister, [[Harold Wilson , on page 9. The paper copied the rival ''Daily Mirror'' in several ways. It was the same size and its masthead had the title in white on a red rectangle of the same colour as the ''Daily Mirror''. The ''Mirror'' ""Live Letters"" was matched by ""Livelier Letters"".  Sex was used as an important element in the content and marketing the paper from the start, which Lamb believed was the most important part of his readers' lives.<ref name=""Telegraph2000""/> The first topless [[Page 3  model appeared on 17 November 1970, [[Stephanie Marrian|Stephanie Rahn ; she was tagged as a ""Birthday Suit Girl"" to mark the first anniversary of the relaunched ''Sun''.<ref name=C&H></ref> A topless Page 3 model gradually became a regular fixture, and with increasingly risqué poses.

Sexually related features such as ""Do Men Still Want To Marry A Virgin?"" and ""The Way into a Woman's Bed"" began to appear. Serialisations of erotic books were frequent; the publication of extracts from ''[[The Sensuous Woman '', at a time when copies of the book were being seized by Customs, produced a scandal and a significant amount of free publicity.<ref name=""C&H32"">Chippindale and Horrie, pp.32–3</ref>  Politically, ''The Sun'' in the early Murdoch years remained nominally Labour-supporting. It advocated a vote for the [[Labour Party  UK |Labour Party  led by [[Harold Wilson  in the 1970 General Election,<ref name=""Thomas""></ref> with the headline ""Why It Must Be Labour"", but by February 1974 it was calling for a vote for the Conservative Party led by [[Edward Heath  while suggesting that it might support a Labour Party led by [[James Callaghan  or [[Roy Jenkins .<ref name=""Thomas""/> In the October election an editorial asserted: ""ALL our instincts are left rather than right and we would vote for any able politician who would describe himself as a Social Democrat.""<ref name=""Thomas""/> In the [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|1975 referendum  on Britain continuing membership of the [[European Economic Community , it advocated a vote to stay in the Common Market.  The editor, Larry Lamb, was originally from a Labour background with a socialist upbringing, while his temporary replacement Bernard Shrimsley  1972–75  was a middle-class uncommitted [[Conservative Party  UK |Conservative . An extensive advertising campaign on the [[ITV  TV network |ITV  network in this period, voiced by actor [[Christopher Timothy , may have helped ''The Sun'' to overtake the ''Daily Mirror'' circulation in 1978. Despite the industrial relations of the 1970s – the so-called ""[[Spanish practices "" of the print unions – ''The Sun'' was very profitable, enabling Murdoch to expand his operations to the [[List of newspapers in the United States|United States  from 1973.  === Thatcher years === ==== Changes ==== In 1979, the paper endorsed [[Margaret Thatcher  in the year's [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|general election  at the end of a process which had been under way for some time, though ''The Sun'' had not initially been enthusiastic for Thatcher. On 3 May 1979, it ran the unequivocal front-page headline, ""VOTE TORY THIS TIME"".  The ''[[Daily Star  United Kingdom |Daily Star '' had been launched in 1978 by Express Newspapers, and by 1981 had begun to affect sales of ''The Sun''. So [[Bingo  Commonwealth |bingo  was introduced as a marketing tool and a 2p drop in cover price removed the ''Daily Star''s competitive advantage opening a new circulation battle which resulted in ''The Sun'' neutralising the threat of the new paper.<ref name=""Page331"">Bruce Page ''The Murdoch Archipelago'', London: Simon & Schuster, 2003 [2004], p.331</ref> The new editor of ''The Sun'', [[Kelvin MacKenzie , took up his post in 1981 just after these developments, and ""changed the British tabloid concept more profoundly than [Larry] Lamb did"", according to Bruce Page; under MacKenzie<ref name=""Page331""/> the paper became ""more outrageous, opinionated and irreverent than anything ever produced in Britain"".  ==== Falklands War ==== [[File:The Sun  Gotcha .png|thumb|upright|Front page of ''The Sun''  4 May 1982  in early editions following the torpedoing of the ''[[ARA General Belgrano|Belgrano ''.

""There are traitors in our midst"", wrote leader writer Ronald Spark on 7 May, accusing commentators on ''Daily Mirror'' and ''The Guardian'', plus the BBC's defence correspondent [[Peter Snow , of ""treason"" for aspects of their coverage.  The [[satirical  magazine ''[[Private Eye  magazine |Private Eye '' mocked and lampooned what they regarded as the paper's [[jingoistic  coverage, most memorably with the mock-''Sun'' headline ""KILL AN ARGIE, WIN A [[Rover Metro|METRO !"", to which MacKenzie is said to have jokingly responded, ""Why didn't we think of that?""<ref name=""Greenslade2002""/>  ==== ''The Sun'' and the Labour Party ==== These years included what was called ""spectacularly malicious coverage"" of the Labour Party by ''The Sun'' and other newspapers. During the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|general election of 1983  ''The Sun'' ran a front page featuring an unflattering photograph of [[Michael Foot , then aged almost 70, claiming he was unfit to be Prime Minister on grounds of his age, appearance and policies, alongside the headline ""Do You Really Want This Old Fool To Run Britain?""<ref name=StillShines>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1209115.stm ""Sun still shines for Blair""], BBC News, 8 March 2001;</ref> A year later, in 1984, ''The Sun'' made clear its enthusiastic support for the re-election of [[Ronald Reagan  as president in the USA. Reagan was two weeks off his 74th birthday when he started his second term, in January 1985.  On 1 March 1984 the newspaper extensively quoted a respected American psychiatrist claiming that British left-wing politician [[Tony Benn  was ""insane"", with the psychiatrist discussing various aspects of Benn's supposed pathology. The story, which appeared on the day of the [[Chesterfield by-election, 1984|Chesterfield byelection  in which Benn was standing, was discredited when the psychiatrist quoted by ''The Sun'' publicly denounced the article and described the false quotes attributed to him as ""absurd"", ''The Sun'' having apparently fabricated the entire piece. The newspaper made frequent scathing attacks on what the paper called the ""[[loony left "" element within the Labour Party and on institutions supposedly controlled by it. [[Ken Livingstone , the leader of the left-wing [[Greater London Council , was described as ""the most odious man in Britain"" in October 1981.  ''The Sun'', during the [[UK miners' strike  1984–1985 |miners' strike of 1984–85 , supported the police and the Thatcher government against the striking [[National Union of Mineworkers  Great Britain |NUM  miners, and in particular the union's president, [[Arthur Scargill . On 23 May 1984, ''The Sun'' prepared a front page with the headline ""Mine [[Führer "" and a photograph of Scargill with his arm in the air, a pose which made him look as though he was giving a [[Nazi salute . The print workers at ''The Sun'' refused to print it. ''The Sun'' strongly supported the April 1986 bombing of [[Libya  by the US, which was launched from British bases. Several civilians were killed during the bombing. Their leader was ""Right Ron, Right Maggie"". That year, Labour MP [[Clare Short  attempted in vain to persuade Parliament to outlaw the pictures on Page Three and gained opprobrium from the newspaper for her stand.  During the 1987 general election, ''The Sun'' ran a mock-editorial entitled ""Why I'm Backing [[Neil Kinnock|Kinnock , by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin "".  ==== Murdoch's response ==== Murdoch has responded to some of the arguments against the newspaper by saying that critics are ""snobs"" who want to ""impose their tastes on everyone else"", while MacKenzie claims the same critics are people who, if they ever had a ""popular idea"", would have to ""go and lie down in a dark room for half an hour"". Both have pointed to the huge commercial success of the ''Sun'' in this period and its establishment as Britain's top-selling newspaper, claiming that they are ""giving the public what they want"". This conclusion is disputed by critics. [[John Pilger  has said that a late-1970s edition of the ''Daily Mirror'', which replaced the usual celebrity and domestic political news items with an entire issue devoted to his own front-line reporting of the [[Cambodian genocide|genocide in Pol Pot's Cambodia , not only outsold ''The Sun'' on the day it was issued but became the only edition of the ''Daily Mirror'' to ever sell every single copy issued throughout the country, something never achieved by ''The Sun''.  In January 1986 Murdoch shut down the Bouverie Street premises of ''The Sun'' and ''News of the World'', and moved operations to the new [[Wapping  complex in East London, substituting the electricians' union for the print unions as his production staff's representatives and greatly reducing the number of staff employed to print the papers; a year-long [[picketing  protest |picket  by sacked workers was eventually defeated  see [[Wapping dispute  .  ==== ""Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster"" ==== [[File:Freddiehamster.jpg|thumb|left|upright|""Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster"", 13 March 1986  During this period, ''The Sun'' gained a reputation for running sensationalistic stories with questionable veracity. On 13 March 1986, the newspaper published one of its best known headlines: ""FREDDIE STARR ATE MY HAMSTER"".  The story alleged that British comedian [[Freddie Starr , while staying at the home of a writer and old friend of his named Vince McCaffrey and his partner Lea LaSalle<ref name=""Clifford"">Max Clifford and Angela Levin ''Max Clifford: Read All About It'', London: Random House, 2010, p.123</ref> in [[Birchwood , Cheshire, had, after returning from a performance at a nightclub in the early hours, found little to eat in their house. Starr put LaSalle's pet hamster, she was reported as saying, ""between two slices of bread and started eating it"".  According to ''Max Clifford: Read All About It'', written by Clifford and Angela Levin, La Salle invented the story out of frustration with Starr who had been working on a book with McCaffrey. She contacted an acquaintance who worked for ''The Sun'' in Manchester. The story reportedly delighted MacKenzie, who was keen to run it, and Max Clifford, who had been Starr's public relations agent.<ref name=""Clifford""/> Starr had to be persuaded that the apparent revelation would not damage him; the attention helped to revive his career. In his 2001 autobiography ''Unwrapped'', Starr wrote that the incident was a complete fabrication: ""I have never eaten or even nibbled a live hamster, gerbil, guinea pig, mouse, shrew, vole or any other small mammal.""  ==== Elton John and other celebrities ==== Fuelled by MacKenzie's preoccupation with the subject, stories in ''The Sun'' insinuated and spread rumours about the sexual orientation of famous people, especially pop stars.  Eventually resulting in 17 libel writs in total, ''The Sun'' ran a series of false stories about the pop musician [[Elton John  from 25 February 1987. They began with an invented account of the singer having sexual relationships with rent boys. The singer-songwriter was abroad on the day indicated in the story, as former ''Sun'' journalist [[John Blake  journalist |John Blake , recently poached by the ''Daily Mirror'', soon discovered. After further stories, in September 1987, ''The Sun'' accused John of having his [[Rottweiler  guard dogs' [[surgical debarking|voice boxes surgically removed .<ref name=""Chippindale322"">Chippindale & Horrie, p.322</ref> In November, the ''Daily Mirror'' found their rival's only source for the rent boy story and he admitted it was a totally fictitious concoction created for money. The inaccurate story about his dogs, actually [[German Shepherd|Alsatians ,<ref name=""Chippindale322""/> put pressure on ''The Sun'', and John received £1&nbsp;million in an out of court settlement, then the largest damages payment in British history. ''The Sun'' ran a front-page apology on 12 December 1988, under the banner headline ""SORRY, ELTON"". In May 1987, gay men were offered free one-way airline tickets to Norway to leave Britain for good: ""Fly Away Gays – And We Will Pay"" was the paper's headline. Gay Church of England clergymen were described in one headline in November 1987 as ""Pulpit poofs"".  Television personality [[Piers Morgan , a former editor of the ''Daily Mirror'' and of ''The Sun''s ""Bizarre"" pop column, has said that during the late 1980s, at Kelvin MacKenzie's behest, he was ordered to speculate on the sexuality of male pop stars for a feature headlined ""The Poofs of Pop"".<ref name=""Morgan05""></ref> He also recalls MacKenzie headlining a January 1989 story about the first same-sex kiss on the BBC television soap opera ''[[EastEnders '' ""EastBenders"",<ref name=""Morgan05""/> describing the kiss between [[Colin Russell  EastEnders |Colin Russell  and [[Guido Smith  as ""a homosexual love scene between yuppie poofs ... when millions of children were watching"".  In 1990, the Press Council adjudicated against ''The Sun'' and columnist [[Garry Bushell  for their use of derogatory terminology about gays.  ==== AIDS ==== ''The Sun'' responded to the health crisis on 8 May 1983 with the headline: ""US Gay Blood Plague Kills Three in Britain"".  On 17 November 1989, ''The Sun'' headlined a page 2 news story titled ""STRAIGHT SEX CANNOT GIVE YOU AIDS – OFFICIAL.""<ref name=""truth""/> ''The Sun'' favourably cited the opinions of [[Baron Kilbracken|Lord Kilbracken , a member of the [[All-Party Parliamentary Group|All Parliamentary Group on AIDS . Lord Kilbracken said that only one person out of the 2,372 individuals with [[HIV/AIDS  mentioned in a specific [[Department of Health  United Kingdom |Department of Health  report was not a member of a ""high risk group"", such as homosexuals and recreational drug users. ''The Sun'' also ran an editorial further arguing that ""At last the truth can be told ... the risk of catching AIDS if you are heterosexual is 'statistically invisible'. In other words, impossible. So now we know – everything else is homosexual propaganda."" Although many other British press services covered Lord Kilbracken's public comments, none of them made the argument that the ''Sun'' did in its editorial and none of them presented Lord Kilbracken's ideas without context or criticism.<ref name=""truth""></ref>  Critics stated that both ''The Sun'' and Lord Kilbracken [[Cherry picking  fallacy |cherry-picked  the results from one specific study while ignoring other data reports on HIV infection and not just AIDS infection, which the critics viewed as unethical politicisation of a medical issue. Lord Kilbracken himself criticised ''The Sun'' editorial and the headline of its news story; he stated that while he thought that gay people were more at risk of developing AIDS it was still wrong to imply that no one else could catch the disease. The [[Press Council  UK |Press Council  condemned ''The Sun'' for committing what it called a ""gross distortion"". ''The Sun'' later published an apology, which they ran on Page 28. Journalist [[David Randall  argued in the textbook ''The Universal Journalist'' that ''The Sun'' story was one of the worst cases of journalistic malpractice in recent history, putting its own readers in harm's way.<ref name=truth/>  ==== Hillsborough disaster and its aftermath ====  [[File:Hillsborough disaster Sun.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Sun'' front page on 19 April 1989. The allegations were later proven to be entirely false, with ''The Sun'' later admitting their decision to publish the allegations was the ""blackest day in this newspaper's history.""  [[File:The Sun Liverpool.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster urging the Liverpool public not to purchase ''The Sun''  At the end of the decade, ''The Sun''s coverage of the Hillsborough football stadium disaster in [[Sheffield  on 15 April 1989, in which 96 people died as a result of their injuries, proved to be, as the paper later admitted, the ""most terrible"" blunder in its history.  Under a front-page headline ""The Truth"", the paper printed allegations provided to them that some fans picked the pockets of crushed victims, that others urinated on members of the emergency services as they tried to help and that some even assaulted a police constable ""whilst he was administering the kiss of life to a patient."" Despite the headline, written by [[Kelvin MacKenzie , the story was based on allegations either by unnamed and unattributable sources, or hearsay accounts of what named individuals had said – a fact made clear to MacKenzie by Harry Arnold, the reporter who wrote the story.<ref name=""brook2005""></ref>  The front page caused outrage in [[Liverpool , where the paper lost more than three-quarters of its estimated 55,000 daily sales and still sells poorly in the city more than 25 years later  around 12,000 .<ref name=""brook2005""/> It is unavailable in parts of the city, as many newsagents refuse to stock it.<ref name=""SunLiverpool""></ref><ref name=""Publican""></ref> It was revealed in a documentary called ''Alexei Sayle's Liverpool'', aired in September 2008, that many Liverpudlians will not even take the newspaper for free, and those who do may simply burn or tear it up. Local people often refer to the newspaper as ""The Scum"", with campaigners believing it handicapped their fight for justice.  The Sun has lost many millions of pounds in revenue in sales and advertising from the boycott on Merseyside.  ===== Later repercussions ===== On 7 July 2004, in response to verbal attacks in Liverpool on [[Wayne Rooney , just before his transfer from [[Everton F.C.|Everton  to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United , who had sold his life story to ''The Sun'', the paper devoted a full-page editorial to an apology for the ""awful error"" of its Hillsborough coverage and argued that Rooney  who was only three years old at the time of Hillsborough  should not be punished for its ""past sins"". In January 2005, ''The Sun'' managing editor [[Graham Dudman  admitting the Hillsborough coverage was ""the worst mistake in our history"", added: ""What we did was a terrible mistake. It was a terrible, insensitive, horrible article, with a dreadful headline; but what we'd also say is: we have apologised for it, and the entire senior team here now is completely different from the team that put the paper out in 1989.""  In May 2006, Kelvin MacKenzie, ''Sun'' editor at the time of the Hillsborough disaster, returned to the paper as a columnist. Furthermore, on 11 January 2007, MacKenzie stated, while a panellist on BBC1's ''[[Question Time  TV series |Question Time '', that the apology he made about the coverage was a hollow one, forced upon him by [[Rupert Murdoch . MacKenzie further claimed he was not sorry ""for telling the truth"" but he admitted that he did not know whether some Liverpool fans urinated on the police, or robbed victims.  On 12 September 2012, following the publication of the official report into the disaster using previously withheld Government papers which officially [[exonerated  the Liverpool fans present, MacKenzie issued the following statement:   Trevor Hicks, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, rejected Mr MacKenzie's apology as ""too little, too late"", calling him ""[[lowlife , clever lowlife, but lowlife"".  Following the publication of the report ''The Sun'' apologised on its front page, under the headline ""The Real Truth"". With the newspaper's editor at the time, Dominic Mohan, adding underneath:   Liverpool FC supporters and a significant majority of the City of Liverpool's residents have continued to boycott the newspaper as a result of the Hillsborough tragedy. In February 2017, Liverpool FC blocked the access of ''Sun'' journalists to its grounds, banning them from on-site coverage of matches and direct participation in press conferences. The newspaper said the decision ""is bad for fans and bad for football"".  The newspaper was banned by [[Everton F.C.  in April after ''The Sun'' published a column by former editor Kelvin MacKenzie the day before the 28th anniversary of the disaster which included a passage about footballer [[Ross Barkley  that was considered ""appalling and indefensible"" and included a racist epithet and insults against the people of Liverpool. Access to the club grounds and facilities for ''Sun'' reporters were blocked. The [[Mayor of Liverpool  [[Joe Anderson  politician |Joe Anderson  described the article as ""disgrace"" and a ""slur"" on the city. MacKenzie was suspended as a contributor to the paper on the day of publication.  === 1990s === [[File:It%27s_The_Sun_Wot_Won_It.jpg|thumb|""[[It's The Sun Wot Won It "": front page of ''The Sun'' on 11 April 1992 after the Conservatives won [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|the election . The headline is regularly mentioned in debates about media influence in British politics.  ''The Sun'' remained loyal to Thatcher right up to her resignation in November 1990, despite the party's fall in popularity over the previous year following the introduction of the [[Poll tax  Great Britain |poll tax   officially known as the Community Charge . This change to the way local government is funded was vociferously supported by the newspaper, despite widespread opposition,  some from Conservative MPs , which is seen as having contributed to Thatcher's own downfall. The tax was quickly repealed by her successor [[John Major , whom ''The Sun'' initially supported enthusiastically, believing the former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer  was a radical Thatcherite.  On the day of the general election of 9 April 1992, its front-page headline, encapsulating its antipathy towards the Labour leader [[Neil Kinnock , read ""If Kinnock wins today, will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights"". Two days later ''The Sun'' was so convinced its front page had swung a close election for the Conservatives it declared ""[[It's The Sun Wot Won It "".  ''The Sun'' led with a headline ""Now we've all been screwed by the cabinet"" with a reference to [[Black Wednesday  on 17 September 1992, and the exposure a few months earlier of an extra-marital affair in which Cabinet Minister [[David Mellor  was involved. A month later, on 14 October, it attacked [[Michael Heseltine  for the mass coal [[mine closure s.  Despite its initial opposition to the closures, until 1997, the newspaper repeatedly called for the implementation of further Thatcherite policies, such as [[Royal Mail  privatisation, and social security cutbacks, with leaders such as ""Peter Lilley is right, we can't carry on like this"". The paper showed hostility to the [[European Union   EU  and approval of public spending cuts, tax cuts, and promotion of right-wing ministers to the cabinet, with leaders such as ""More of the Redwood, not Deadwood"".  ''The Sun'' attacked Labour leader [[John Smith  Labour Party leader |John Smith  in February 1994, for saying that more British troops should be sent to [[Bosnia . ''The Sun'' comment was that ""The only serious radicals in British politics these days are the likes of Redwood, Lilley and Portillo"". It also gradually expressed its bitter disillusionment with John Major as Prime Minister, with leaders such as ""What fools we were to back John Major"".  Between 1994 and 1996, ''The Sun'' circulation peaked. Its highest average sale was in the week ending 16 July 1994, when the daily figure was 4,305,957. The highest ever one-day sale was on 18 November 1995  4,889,118 , although the cover price had been cut to 10p. The highest ever one-day sale at full price was on 30 March 1996  4,783,359 .  On 22 January 1997, ''The Sun'' accused the shadow chancellor [[Gordon Brown  of stealing the Conservatives' ideas by declaring, ""If all he is offering is Conservative financial restraint, why not vote for the real thing?"" and called the planned windfall tax, which was later imposed by the Labour government, ""wrongheaded"". In February 1997 it told Sir [[Edward Heath  MP to stand down for supporting a national minimum wage.  ==== Support for New Labour ==== ''The Sun'' switched support to the Labour party on 18 March 1997, six weeks before the General Election victory which saw the [[New Labour  leader [[Tony Blair  become Prime Minister with a large parliamentary majority, despite the paper having attacked Blair and New Labour up to a month earlier. Its front-page headline read THE SUN BACKS BLAIR and its front-page editorial made clear that while it still opposed some New Labour policies, such as the minimum wage and devolution, it believed Blair to be ""the breath of fresh air this great country needs"".<ref name=""archive1997"">''The Sun'', 18 March 1997</ref> John Major's Conservatives, it said, were ""tired, divided and rudderless"".<ref name=""archive1997""/> Blair, who had radically altered his party's image and policies, noting the influence the paper could have over its readers' political thinking, had courted it  and Murdoch  for some time by granting exclusive interviews and writing columns.  In exchange for Rupert Murdoch's support, Blair agreed not to join the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism  which John Major had [[Black Wednesday|withdrawn the country from  in September 1992 after barely two years. Cabinet Minister [[Peter Mandelson  was ""outed"" by [[Matthew Parris   a former ''Sun'' columnist  on BBC TV's ''[[Newsnight '' in November 1998. Misjudging public response, ''The Sun'' editor David Yelland demanded to know in a front-page editorial whether Britain was governed by a ""gay mafia"" of a ""closed world of men with a mutual self-interest"". Three days later the paper apologised in another editorial which said ''The Sun'' would never again reveal a person's sexuality unless it could be defended on the grounds of ""overwhelming public interest"".  In 2003, the paper was accused of racism by the government over its criticisms of what it perceived as the ""open door"" policy on immigration. The attacks came from the Prime Minister's press spokesman [[Alastair Campbell  and the Home Secretary [[David Blunkett   later a ''Sun'' columnist . The paper rebutted the claim, believing that it was not racist to suggest that a ""tide"" of unchecked illegal immigrants was increasing the risk of terrorist attacks and infectious diseases. It did not help its argument by publishing a front-page story on 4 July 2003, under the headline ""Swan Bake"", which claimed that asylum seekers were slaughtering and eating swans. It later proved to have no basis in fact. Subsequently, ''The Sun'' published a follow-up headlined ""Now they're after our fish!"". Following a [[Press Complaints Commission  adjudication a ""clarification"" was eventually printed, on page 41. In 2005 ''The Sun'' published photographs of Prince Harry sporting a Nazi costume to a fancy dress party. The photographs caused outrage across the world and [[Clarence House  was forced to issue a statement in response apologising for any offence or embarrassment caused.  Despite being a persistent critic of some of the government's policies, the paper supported Labour in both subsequent elections the party won. For the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election , ''The Sun'' backed Blair and Labour for a third consecutive election win and vowed to give him ""one last chance"" to fulfil his promises, despite berating him for several weaknesses including a failure to control immigration. However, it did speak of its hope that the Conservatives  led by [[Michael Howard   would one day be fit for a return to government.<ref name=StillShines/> This election  Blair had declared it would be his last as prime minister  resulted in Labour's third successive win but with a much reduced majority.  === Editorial and production issues in the 2000s === [[File:Potters Road shops, Barnet  cropped .JPG|thumb|''Sun''-branded newsagent shop  When [[Rebekah Brooks|Rebekah Wade   now Brooks  became editor in 2003, it was thought Page 3 might be dropped. Wade had tried to persuade [[David Yelland  journalist |David Yelland , her immediate predecessors in the job, to scrap the feature, but a model who shared her first name was used on her first day in the post.  On 22 September 2003, the newspaper appeared to misjudge the public mood surrounding mental health, as well as its affection for former world heavyweight champion boxer [[Frank Bruno , who had been admitted to hospital, when the headline ""Bonkers Bruno Locked Up"" appeared on the front page of early editions. The adverse reaction, once the paper had hit the streets on the evening of 21 September, led to the headline being changed for the paper's second edition to the more sympathetic ""Sad Bruno in Mental Home"".  ''The Sun'' has been openly antagonistic towards other European nations, particularly the French and Germans. During the 1980s and 1990s, the nationalities were routinely described in copy and headlines as ""frogs"", ""krauts"" or ""hun"". As the paper is opposed to the EU it has referred to foreign leaders who it deemed hostile to the UK in unflattering terms. Former President [[Jacques Chirac  of France, for instance, was branded ""le Worm"". An unflattering picture of German chancellor [[Angela Merkel , taken from the rear, bore the headline ""I'm Big in the Bumdestag""  17 April 2006 .  Although ''The Sun'' was outspoken against the racism directed at [[Bollywood  actress [[Shilpa Shetty  on television reality show ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 5  UK |Celebrity Big Brother '' during 2007, the paper captioned a picture on its website, from a Bollywood-themed pop video by [[Hilary Duff , ""Hilary [[Papadum|PoppaDuff "", a very similar insult to that directed at Shetty.  On 7 January 2009, ''The Sun'' ran an exclusive front-page story claiming that participants in a discussion on Ummah.com, a [[British Muslim  [[internet forum , had made a ""hate hit list"" of [[British Jews  to be targeted by extremists over the [[Gaza War  2008–09 |Gaza War . It was claimed that ""Those listed [on the forum] should treat it very seriously. Expect a hate campaign and intimidation by 20 or 30 thugs."" The UK magazine ''[[Private Eye '' claimed that [[Glen Jenvey , a man quoted by ''The Sun'' as a terrorism expert, who had been posting to the forum under the pseudonym ""Abuislam"", was the only forum member promoting a hate campaign while other members promoted peaceful advocacy, such as writing ""polite letters"". The story has since been removed from ''The Sun'' website following complaints to the UK's [[Press Complaints Commission .  On 9 December 2010, ''The Sun'' published a front-page story claiming that terrorist group [[Al-Qaeda  had threatened a terrorist attack on [[Granada Television  in Manchester to disrupt the episode of the soap opera ''[[Coronation Street '' to be transmitted [[Coronation Street: 50th anniversary live episode|live  that evening. The paper cited unnamed sources, claiming ""cops are throwing a ring of steel around tonight's live episode of ''Coronation Street'' over fears it has been targeted by Al-Qaeda."" Later that morning, however, [[Greater Manchester Police  categorically denied having ""been made aware of any threat from Al-Qaeda or any other proscribed organisation.""<ref name=""deny""></ref> ''The Sun'' published a small correction on 28 December, admitting ""that while cast and crew were subject to full body searches, there was no specific threat from Al-Qaeda as we reported."" The apology had been negotiated by the Press Complaints Commission. For the day following the [[2011 Norway attacks , ''The Sun'' produced an early edition blaming the massacre on al-Qaeda on its front page. Later the perpetrator was revealed to be [[Anders Behring Breivik , a [[Right-wing terrorism|far-right terrorist  from Norway.  In January 2008, the [[Wapping  presses printed ''The Sun'' for the last time and London printing was transferred to [[Waltham Cross  in the Borough of [[Broxbourne  in Hertfordshire, where News International had built what is claimed to be the largest printing centre in Europe with 12 presses. The site also produces ''[[The Times '' and ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times '', ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph '' and ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph '', ''[[The Wall Street Journal Europe|Wall Street Journal Europe ''  also a Murdoch newspaper , the ''[[London Evening Standard '', and local papers. Northern printing had earlier been switched to a new plant at Knowsley on Merseyside and the ''Scottish Sun'' to another new plant at Motherwell near Glasgow. The three print centres represent a £600&nbsp;million investment by NI and allowed all the titles to be produced with every page in full colour from 2008. The Waltham Cross plant is capable of producing one million copies an hour of a 120-page tabloid newspaper.  In early 2011, the company vacated the Wapping complex, which in November 2011 was put on the market for a reputed £200&nbsp;million. In May 2012, it was reported the Wapping site had been sold for £150&nbsp;million to St George, part of [[Berkeley Group Holdings .<ref name=""Wapping Sale""></ref>  ==== 2009: ''The Sun'' returns to the Conservatives ====  Politically, the paper's stance was less clear under Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown  who succeeded Blair in June 2007. Its editorials were critical of many of Brown's policies and often more supportive of those of Conservative leader [[David Cameron . [[Rupert Murdoch , head of ''The Sun''s parent company News Corporation, speaking at a 2007 meeting with the [[House of Lords  Select Committee on Communications, which was investigating media ownership and the news, said that he acts as a ""traditional proprietor"". This means he exercises editorial control on major issues such as which political party to back in a general election or which policy to adopt on Europe.<ref name=Parliament070917> </ref>  With ""[[Broken Britain "" controversies on issues like crime, immigration and public service failures in the news, on 30 September 2009, following Brown's speech at the Labour Party Conference, ''The Sun'', under the banner ""Labour's Lost It"", announced that it no longer supported the Labour Party: ""''The Sun'' believes – and prays – that the Conservative leadership can put the great back into Great Britain"".  That day at the Labour Party Conference, union leader [[Tony Woodley  responded by ripping up a copy of that edition of ''The Sun'', remarking as he did so in reference to the newspaper's Hillsborough Disaster controversy: ""In Liverpool we learnt a long time ago what to do"". One attack on Gordon Brown backfired at around this time. After criticising him for misspelling a dead soldier's mother's name, ''The Sun'' was then forced to apologise for misspelling the same name on their website.  The ''Scottish Sun'' did not back either Labour or the Conservatives, with its editorial stating it was ""yet to be convinced"" by the Conservative opposition, and editor David Dinsmore asking in an interview ""what is David Cameron going to do for Scotland?"". Dinsmore also stated that the paper supported the Union, and was unlikely to back the [[Scottish National Party .  During the campaign for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election , ''[[The Independent '' ran ads declaring that ""Rupert Murdoch won't decide this election – you will."" In response [[James Murdoch  media executive |James Murdoch  and [[Rebekah Wade  ""appeared unannounced and uninvited on the editorial floor"" of the ''Independent'', and had an energetic conversation with its editor [[Simon Kelner . Several days later the ''Independent'' reported ''The Sun'' failure to report its own [[YouGov  poll result which said that ""if people thought Mr Clegg's party had a significant chance of winning the election"" the [[Liberal Democrats  UK |Liberal Democrats  would win 49% of the vote, and with it a landslide majority.<ref name=ind230410>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sun-censored-poll-that-showed-support-for-lib-dems-1951940.html 'Sun' censored poll that showed support for Lib Dems] ''[[The Independent '', 23 April 2010,</ref>  On [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|election day   6 May 2010 , ''The Sun'' urged its readers to vote for David Cameron's ""modern and positive"" Conservatives to save Britain from ""disaster"" which the paper thought the country would face if the Labour government was re-elected. The election ended in the first [[hung parliament  after an election for [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|36 years , with the Tories gaining the most seats and votes but being 20 seats short of an overall majority. They finally came to power on 11 May when Gordon Brown stepped down as prime minister, paving the way for David Cameron to become prime minister by forming a coalition with the [[Liberal Democrats  UK |Liberal Democrats .  On 24 August 2012, ''The Sun'' sparked a controversy when it published photos of [[Prince Harry  taken in a private situation with friends while on holiday in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas , USA. While other British newspapers had not published the photos in deference to the privacy of members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family , editorial staff of ''The Sun'' claimed it was a move to test Britain's perception of freedom of the press. In the photos, which were published on the Internet worldwide, Prince Harry was naked.  === Since 2010 === ==== Fallout from the ''News of the World'' scandal ==== [[File:The-Sun-on-Sunday-cover-specimen.jpg|thumb|240px|''The Sun on Sunday'' front page  Following the [[News of the World phone hacking affair|''News of the World'' phone hacking affair  that led to the closure of that paper on 10 July 2011, there was speculation that News International would launch a Sunday edition of ''The Sun'' to replace the ''News of the World''.

A similar URL ''sunonsunday.com'' is not affiliated, having been registered in Italy on 24 September 2007.  On 18 July 2011, the [[LulzSec  group hacked ''The Sun'' website, where they posted a fake news story of Rupert Murdoch's death before redirecting the website to their Twitter page. The group also targeted the website of ''[[The Times ''.<ref name=""Arthur""></ref>  A reporter working for ''The Sun'' was arrested and taken to a south-west London police station on 4 November 2011. The man was the sixth person to be arrested in the UK under the News International related legal probe, [[Operation Elveden . In January 2012, two current and two former employees were arrested. As of 18 January 2013, 22 ''Sun'' journalists had been arrested, including their crime reporter Anthony France.  On 28 January 2012, police arrested four current and former staff members of ''The Sun'', as part of a probe in which journalists paid police officers for information; a police officer was also arrested in the probe. The ''Sun'' staffers arrested were crime editor Mike Sullivan, head of news Chris Pharo, former deputy editor Fergus Shanahan, and former managing editor Graham Dudman, who since became a columnist and media writer. All five arrested were held on suspicion of corruption. Police also searched the offices of News International, the publishers of ''The Sun'', as part of a continuing investigation into the ''News of the World'' scandal.  On 11 February 2012, five senior journalists at ''The Sun'' were arrested, including the [[Geoff Webster  journalist |deputy editor , as part of [[Operation Elveden   the investigation into payments to UK public servants .  Coinciding with a visit to ''The Sun'' newsroom on 17 February 2012, Murdoch announced via an email that the arrested journalists, who had been suspended, would return to work as nothing had been proved against them.<ref name=GuardRMemail/> He also told staff in the email that ''The Sun on Sunday'' would be launched ""very shortly"";<ref name=GuardRMemail/> it was launched on 26 February 2012.  On 27 February 2012, the day after the debut of ''The Sun on Sunday'', Deputy Assistant Commissioner [[Sue Akers  told the [[Leveson Inquiry  that police were investigating a ""network of corrupt officials"" as part of their inquiries into phone hacking and police corruption. She said evidence suggested a ""culture of illegal payments"" at ''The Sun'' authorised at a senior level.  ==== World Cup 2014 free issue ==== On 12 and 13 June 2014, to tie in with the beginning of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup  football tournament, a free special issue of ''The Sun'' was distributed by the [[Royal Mail  to 22 million homes in England.<ref name=""Greenslade110614"">Roy Greenslade [https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jun/11/sun-world-cup-2014 ""The Sun marks the World Cup by giving away 22m papers to English homes""],  Greenslade blog  theguardian.com, 11 June 2014</ref> The promotion, which did not include a Page 3 topless model, was announced in mid-May and was believed to be the first such freesheet issued by a UK national newspaper.

Miliband's decision to pose with a copy of  ''The Sun'' received a strong response.

It was claimed that Tulisa introduced three film producers  actually Mahmood and two other ''Sun'' journalists  to a drug dealer and set up a £800 deal.<ref name=""Greenslade""/> The subterfuge involved conning the singer into believing that she was being considered for a role in an £8&nbsp;million Bollywood film.  At her subsequent trial, the case against Tulisa collapsed at [[Southwark Crown Court  in July 2014, with the judge commenting that there were ""strong grounds"" to believe that Mahmood had lied at a pre-trial hearing and tried to manipulate evidence against the co-defendant Tulisa.<ref name=""Walker"">Peter Walker and Hatty Collier [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/22/mazher-mahmood-sun-perjury-probe-tulisa-contostavlos-trial ""Mazher Mahmood could face perjury investigation after Tulisa trial collapse""], ''The Guardian'', 22 July 2014</ref> Tulisa was cleared of supplying [[Drugs controlled by the UK Misuse of Drugs Act|Class A drugs . After these events, ''The Sun'' released a statement saying that the newspaper ""takes the Judge's remarks very seriously. Mahmood has been suspended pending an immediate internal investigation.""  ==== Trial of staff for misconduct in a public office ==== In October 2014, the trial of six senior staff and journalists at ''The Sun'' newspaper began. All six were charged with conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office. They included ''The Sun''s head of news Chris Pharo, who faced six charges, while ex-managing editor [[Graham Dudman  and ex-''Sun'' deputy news editor Ben O'Driscoll were accused of four charges each. Thames Valley district reporter Jamie Pyatt and picture editor John Edwards were charged with three counts each, while ex-reporter John Troup was accused of two counts. The trial related to illegal payments allegedly made to public officials, with prosecutors saying the men conspired to pay officials from 2002 to 2011, including police, prison officers and soldiers. They were accused of buying confidential information about the Royal Family, public figures and prison inmates. They all denied the charges. On 16 January 2015, Troup and Edwards were cleared by the jury of all charges against them. The jury also partially cleared O'Driscoll and Dudman but continued deliberating over other counts faced by them, as well as the charges against Pharo and Pyatt.<ref name=""BBC News 16 January 2015""></ref> On 21 January 2015, the jury told the court that it was unable to reach unanimous verdicts on any of the outstanding charges and was told by the judge, Richard Marks, that he would accept [[Hung jury#England and Wales|majority verdicts . Shortly afterwards, one of the jurors sent a note to the judge and was discharged. The judge told the remaining 11 jurors that their colleague had been ""feeling unwell and feeling under a great deal of pressure and stress from the situation you are in"", and that under the circumstances he was prepared to accept majority verdicts of ""11 to zero or 10 to 1"".<ref name=""The Guardian 21 Jan 2015""></ref> On 22 January 2015, the jury was discharged after failing to reach verdicts on the outstanding charges. The [[Crown Prosecution Service   CPS  announced that it would seek a retrial.<ref name=""BBC News 22 January 2015""></ref>  On 6 February 2015, it was announced that Judge Richard Marks was to be replaced by Judge Charles Wide at the retrial. Two days earlier, Marks had emailed counsel for the defendants, telling them: ""It has been decided  not by me but by my elders and betters  that I am not going to be doing the retrial"". Reporting the decision in UK newspaper ''[[The Guardian '', Lisa O'Carroll wrote: ""Wide is the only judge so far to have presided in a case which has seen a conviction of a journalist in relation to allegations of unlawful payments to public officials for stories. The journalist, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is appealing the verdict"". Defence counsel for the four journalists threatened to take the decision to judicial review, with the barrister representing Pharo, Nigel Rumfitt QC, saying: ""The way this has come about gives rise to the impression that something has been going on behind the scenes which should not have been going on behind the scenes and which should have been dealt with transparently"". He added that the defendants were ""extremely concerned"" and ""entitled"" to know why Marks was being replaced by Wide.<ref name=""The Guardian 6 February 2015""></ref>  In a separate trial, ''Sun'' reporter Nick Parker was cleared on 9 December 2014 of aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office but found guilty of handling a stolen mobile phone belonging to Labour MP [[Siobhain McDonagh .<ref name=""BBC News 9 December 2014""></ref>  On 22 May 2015, ''Sun'' reporter Anthony France was found guilty of aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office between 2008 and 2011. France's trial followed the London [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police 's [[Operation Elveden , an ongoing investigation into alleged payments to police and officials in exchange for information. He had paid a total of more than £22,000 to PC Timothy Edwards, an anti-terrorism police officer based at Heathrow Airport. The police officer had already pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office and given a two-year gaol sentence in 2014, but the jury in France's trial was not informed of this. Following the passing of the guilty verdict, the officer leading Operation Elveden, Detective Chief Superintendent Gordon Briggs said France and Edwards had been in a ""long-term, corrupt relationship"".<ref name=""BBC News 22 May 2015""></ref>  The BBC reported that France was the first journalist to face trial and be convicted under Operation Elveden since the Crown Prosecution Service  CPS  had revised its guidance in April 2015 so that prosecutions would only be brought against journalists who had made payments to police officers over a period of time. As a result of the change in the CPS' policy, charges against several journalists who had made payments to other types of public officials – including civil servants, health workers and prison staff – had been dropped.<ref name=""BBC News 22 May 2015""/> In July 2015, ''[[Private Eye '' magazine reported that, at a costs hearing at the Old Bailey, ''The Sun'' parent company had refused to pay for the prosecution costs relating to France's trial, leading the presiding judge to express his ""considerable disappointment"" at this state of affairs. Judge Timothy Pontius said in court that France's illegal actions had been part of a ""clearly recognised procedure at ''The Sun''"", adding that, ""There can be no doubt that News International bears some measure of moral responsibility if not legal culpability for the acts of the defendant"". The ''Private Eye'' report noted that despite this ''The Sun'' parent organisation was ""considering disciplinary actions"" against France whilst at the same time it was also preparing to bring a case to the [[Investigatory Powers Tribunal  against the London [[Metropolitan Police Service  for its actions relating to him and two other journalists.<ref name=""Private Eye 24 July 2015""></ref>  ==== End of the Page 3 feature  January 2015  ==== ''The Sun'' defended [[Page 3  for more than 40 years, with  then  editor Dominic Mohan telling the [[Leveson Inquiry  into press standards, in February 2012, that ""Page 3"" was an ""innocuous British Institution, regarded with affection and tolerance.""<ref name=""Mohan""></ref> To mark the feature's 40th anniversary, feminist author [[Germaine Greer  wrote an article in ''The Sun'' on 18 November 2010 published under the headline: ""If I ask my odd-job man what he gets out of page 3, he tells me simply, 'It cheers me up'"".<ref name=""Germaine"">http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Second-Witness-Statement-of-Dominic-Mohan1.pdf</ref>  In August 2013, ''The Irish Sun'' ended the practice of featuring topless models on Page 3. The main newspaper was reported to have followed in 2015 with the edition of 16 January supposedly the last to carry such photographs after a report in ''[[The Times '' made such an assertion.<ref name=""O'Carroll"">Lisa O'Carroll, Mark Sweney and Roy Greenslade [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jan/19/has-the-sun-axed-page-3-topless-pictures ""The Sun calls time on topless Page 3 models after 44 years""], ''The Guardian'', 19 January 2015</ref> After substantial coverage in the media about an alleged change in editorial policy, Page 3 returned to its usual format on 22 January 2015.<ref name=""Telegraph2015"">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11361739/The-Sun-brings-back-page-3.html ""The Sun brings back Page 3""], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 22 January 2015</ref> A few hours before the issue was published, the head of PR at the newspaper said the reputed end of Page 3 had been ""speculation"" only.  Apart from the edition of 22 January, the conventional Page 3 feature of a topless model has not returned, and has effectively ended.  ==== Accusations of xenophobia ==== On 17 April 2015, ''The Sun'' columnist [[Katie Hopkins  called [[Immigration|migrants  to Britain ""cockroaches"" and ""feral humans"" and said they were ""spreading like the norovirus"".<ref name=""ITV180415""></ref><ref name=""Gander""></ref> Her remarks were condemned by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commission for Human Rights . In a statement released on 24 April 2015, High Commissioner [[Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad|Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein  stated that Hopkins' used ""language very similar to that employed by Rwanda's ''[[Kangura '' newspaper and [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines|Radio Mille Collines  during the run up to the [[Rwandan Genocide|1994 genocide "", and noted that both media organisations were subsequently convicted by an international tribunal of public incitement to commit [[genocide .<ref name=Independent></ref>  In August 2017, ''The Sun'' published a column by [[Trevor Kavanagh  which questioned what actions British society should take to deal with ""The Muslim Problem"". Numerous sources suggested the column used language reminiscent of [[Nazi propaganda  and [[Nazi terminology|Nazi phrases . A joint complaint was made to the [[Independent Press Standards Organisation  by the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews , [[Tell MAMA  and Faith Matters. A statement by the groups said ""The printing of the phrase 'The Muslim Problem' – particularly with the capitalisation and italics for emphasis – in a national newspaper sets a dangerous precedent, and harks back to the use of the phrase 'The [[Jewish problem  in the last century, to which the Nazis responded with 'The [[Final Solution ' – the [[Holocaust "". A cross-party group of over 100 MPs from the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens subsequently signed a letter to the editor of ''The Sun'' demanding action over the column. The letter stated the MPs ""were truly outraged by the hate and bigotry"" in Kavanagh's column.  ==== Brexit ==== On 9 March 2016, ''The Sun''s front page proclaimed that Queen [[Elizabeth II  was backing [[Brexit , a common term for a British withdrawal from the European Union. It claimed that in 2011 at [[Windsor Castle , while having lunch with Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg , the monarch criticised the union. Clegg denied that the Queen made such a statement, and a [[Buckingham Palace  spokesperson confirmed that a complaint had been made to the [[Independent Press Standards Organisation  over a breach of guidelines relating to accuracy.  ''The Sun'' officially endorsed the Leave campaign in the British [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum to remain in or leave  the [[European Union  on 23 June 2016, urging its readers to vote for the United Kingdom to leave the EU. The ""BeLeave in Britain"" front-page headline was only present on copies distributed in England and Wales; editions for Scotland, Northern Ireland  and the Republic of Ireland  led on other topics.  On 4 April 2017, ''The Sun'' printed a headline ""Up Yours, Senors""  cross-referring the 1990 headline ""Up Yours, Delors"" regarding the [[European Currency Unit|ECU  . It was in relation to disputes over the sovereignty of [[Gibraltar  following the EU referendum. The middle pages featured a poster with the message ""Hands off our rock"".  ==== Website redesign ==== In June 2016, a redesign of ''The Sun'' website was launched.<ref name=""redesign""></ref>  ==== Sexualising young actress ==== In June 2018, ''The Sun'' provoked controversy after it criticised the dress worn by a 17-year-old actress, [[Isobel Steele , to the British Soap Awards. The paper critiqued Steele for her decision to ""cover up from head to toe"" and told her to ""flash a bit of flesh"". The paper, and the journalist responsible for the piece, Tracey Lea Sayer, subsequently apologised. Sayer reported that when she wrote the article she was not aware of the age of Steele.  ==Circulation== ''The Sun'' dominated the circulation figures for daily newspapers in the United Kingdom since the late 1970s, at times easily outpacing its nearest rivals, the ''Daily Mirror'' and the ''Daily Mail''. For a brief period in the late 1990s and early 2000s this lead was more than a million copies per day. Sustained decline began in 2004, in line with print journalism as a whole, and in the six-year period from 2012-18 it lost more than a million copies from its daily figures. ''The Sun'''s long run at the top was finally broken in February 2018 when it was announced that the circulation of the free ''Metro'' newspaper had overtaken it for the first time. However it remains the biggest-selling newspaper in the UK.  == Editors == * [[Sydney Jacobson   1964–1965, previously editor of the ''[[Daily Herald  UK newspaper |Daily Herald '' before the name change  * [[Dick Dinsdale   1965–1969  * [[Larry Lamb  newspaper editor |Larry Lamb   1969–1972  * [[Bernard Shrimsley   1972–1975; Lamb was editorial director, supervising both the ''Sun'' and ''News of the World''  * Larry Lamb  1975–1980; Lamb took an enforced six-month sabbatical before being sacked by Murdoch  * [[Kelvin MacKenzie   1981–1994  * [[Stuart Higgins   1994–1998  * [[David Yelland  journalist |David Yelland   1998–2003  * Rebekah Wade  now [[Rebekah Brooks , 2003–2009  * [[Dominic Mohan   2009–2013  * [[David Dinsmore   2013–2015 <ref name=""BBC2106"">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23007739 ""David Dinsmore replaces Dominic Mohan as Sun editor""].

Based in Glasgow, it duplicates much of the content of the main edition but with alternative coverage of Scottish news and sport. The launch editor was Jack Irvine who had been recruited from the ''[[Daily Record  Scotland |Daily Record ''.  In the early 1990s, the Scottish edition declared support for the pro-independence [[Scottish National Party . At the time the paper elsewhere continued to support the Conservatives, who were then becoming an increasingly marginalised force in Scotland.  However, the ''Scottish Sun'' had performed a U-turn by the time of the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 Scottish parliamentary election , in which its front page featured a [[Hangman's knot|hangman's noose  in the shape of an SNP logo, stating ""Vote SNP today and you put Scotland's head in the noose"". The ''Scottish Sun'' voiced its support for the SNP in the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2011|2011 parliamentary election .  Although it expressed some support for [[Alex Salmond , then [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister  and the SNP's leader, ''The Scottish Sun'' took a neutral stance on the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on Scottish independence . On 17 September, the day before the poll, an editorial commented: ""What we cannot do is tell you how we think you should vote"".  At the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election , ''The Scottish Sun'' urged its readers to back the SNP. While in England and Wales, the paper saw a vote for the Conservatives as a means to ""stop [the] SNP running the country"", the edition north of the border said the SNP would ""fight harder for Scotland's interests at Westminster"".<ref name=""Withnall""/>  === ''The Irish Sun'' and ''The Irish Sun on Sunday'' === The Irish edition of the newspaper, based in Dublin, is known as the ''Irish Sun'', with a regional sub-edition for [[Northern Ireland  where it is mastheaded as ''The Sun'', based in Belfast. The Republic of Ireland edition shares some content – namely glamour and showbiz – with the editions published in Great Britain, but has mainly Irish news and editorial content, as well as sport and advertising.  It often views stories in a very different light to those being reported in the UK editions. Editions of the paper in Great Britain described the film ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley  film |The Wind That Shakes the Barley ''  2006  as being ""designed to drag the reputation of our nation through the mud"" and ""the most pro-IRA ever""; conversely, the Republic of Ireland edition praised the film and described it as giving ""the Brits a tanning"".  ''The Irish Sun'', unlike its sister papers in Great Britain, did not have a designated website until late 2012. An unaffiliated news site with the name ''Irish Sun'' has been in operation since mid-2004.<ref name=""Irish Sun About Us""></ref>  There is also an Irish edition of the ''Sun on Sunday'', the ''Irish Sun on Sunday'', which launched in February 2012.  === ''Polski Sun'' === ''Polski Sun'' was a Polish-language version of the newspaper which ran for six issues in June 2008 during the [[UEFA Euro 2008  football tournament, on the days of and the days after Poland played matches. Each issue had a circulation of 50,000–75,000, in relation to the estimated 600,000 Poles in the United Kingdom at the time.  == See also ==  * ''[[CTB v News Group Newspapers Ltd '' * [[Dear Deidre  * [[Jon Gaunt   == References ==   == External links ==   *  * [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/15/newsid_3068000/3068749.stm ""On This Day""].

939,Y,antiwar.com,"[[File:Antiwar logo.png|right|frame  '''Antiwar.com''' is a [[Libertarianism|libertarian  website which describes itself as devoted to ""[[non-interventionism "" and as opposing [[imperialism  and [[war . It is a project of the [[Randolph Bourne#Randolph Bourne Institute|Randolph Bourne Institute . The website states that it is ""fighting the next information war: we are dedicated to the proposition that war hawks and our leaders are not going to be allowed to get away with it unopposed and unchallenged.""  ==History== The site was founded in December 1995, as a response to the [[Bosnian war . It is a [[501 c |501 c  3   nonprofit foundation, operating under the auspices of the [[Randolph Bourne Institute , based in [[Atherton, California . It was previously affiliated with the [[Center for Libertarian Studies  and functioned before that as an independent, ad-supported website.  In 2011, the site discovered it was being monitored by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation . After their [[Freedom of Information Act  United States |Freedom of Information Act  request failed to produce results, they worked with the [[American Civil Liberties Union  of Northern California which in May 2013 filed a freedom of the press lawsuit for full FBI records on Antiwar.com, Eric Garris and Justin Raimondo. The documents received in November 2013 indicated that the FBI in San Francisco, and later in Newark, New Jersey, began monitoring the site after Eric Garris passed along to the FBI a threat to hack the Antiwar.com website. The FBI mistakenly took this as an actual threat against its own website and began monitoring Antiwar.com and its editors. Eric Garris demanded the FBI correct its file.  ==Stance== The site’s first objective “was to fight against intervention in the [[Balkans  under the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton presidency .” It “applied the same principles to Clinton's campaigns in [[Haiti  and [[Kosovo  and [[Operation Infinite Reach|bombings  of [[Sudan  and [[Afghanistan .” Antiwar.com opposed the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and generally opposes [[Interventionism  politics |interventionism , including the US [[bombing  of [[Serbia  and continuing occupation of [[Afghanistan . It has also condemned aggressive military action and other forms of belligerence on the part of other governments, as well as what contributors view as the fiscal and civil liberties consequences of war. Wen Stephenson of ''[[The Atlantic '' described the site as marked by “a decidely  [[right-wing  cast of thought.” Its founders characterize themselves as libertarians, and the two principal co-founders were involved in [[libertarian Republican  politics, at the time.  The site features many writers from across the political spectrum, including conservatives such as [[Pat Buchanan , right libertarians such as [[Ron Paul , and left libertarians such as [[Noam Chomsky  and [[Juan Cole .  ==Personnel== Notable site personnel include *[[Justin Raimondo   founder and editorial director  *[[Eric Garris   founder, webmaster, and managing editor  *[[Scott Horton  activist |Scott Horton   assistant editor   ==Notable contributors== Featured writers include:  *[[Doug Bandow  *[[Praful Bidwai  *[[Alan Bock  *[[Jason Ditz  *[[Ivan Eland  *[[Philip Giraldi  *[[Aaron Glantz  *[[Ran HaCohen  *[[David Henderson  economist |David R.

940,Y,missoulian.com,"    The '''''Missoulian''''' is a daily [[newspaper  printed in [[Missoula, Montana . The newspaper has been owned by [[Lee Enterprises  since 1959. The ''Missoulian'' is the largest published newspaper in western [[Montana . The ''Missoulian'' is distributed throughout the city of [[Missoula, Montana , and also throughout most of [[Western Montana .  == History == ===Early years=== The ''Missoulian'' was established as the ''Missoula & Cedar Creek Pioneer'' on September 15, 1870, by the Magee Brothers and I. H. Morrison under the Montana Publishing Company.  Though strictly conservative politically, the paper was never intended to advance any particular ""clique or party"".<ref name=""Chronicling America""/>  Slightly less than a year after removing ""Cedar Creek"" from the name, the paper's name was trimmed to simply ''The Pioneer'' in November 1871 with W. J. McCormick, a prominent Montana politician and father of future Congressman [[Washington J. McCormick , as publisher.  It served as a Democratic paper that was devoted to reporting on the development of western Montana. A month later [[Frank H. Woody|Frank Woody , who would later become Missoula's first mayor, was named ''ad interim'', and he would lengthen the name to the ''Montana Pioneer''.  On February 8, 1873, Woody and his partner T. M. Chisholm purchased the paper and changed its name to ''The Missoulian''.  W. R. Turk replaced Chisholm and Woody would sell out a year later, but the paper's name has more-or-less stayed the same until today.  Turk died of [[tuberculosis  in 1875 and the paper was published by Chauncey Barbour until August 15, 1879 when Duane J. Armstrong became editor and publisher.<ref name=""MT History 1739""></ref>  The newspaper would offer only a weekend edition until 1891 when new owner [[A.B. Hammond  converted it to a daily newspaper with Harrison Spaulding from the ''Missoula County Times'' as editor and publisher.  ===Republican era===  [[File:Daily Missoulian Press Room.jpg|thumb|Daily ''Missoulian'' press room 1923    Hammond's purchase of ''The Missoulian'' brought the newspaper into the republican fold and on the battle lines of the [[William A. Clark  and [[Marcus Daly  [[Copper Kings|Cooper King  feud.  Hammond was a lumber baron and business partner of Daly in the Montana Improvement Company who saw the Democratic president, [[Grover Cleveland 's public land policies a detriment to his business.  Hammond had become very wealthy over-logging unsurveyed public timberland and supplying lumber to the railroad and Daly's [[Anaconda Copper|Anaconda Company's  smelter.  Hammond and his associates in Missoula convinced Daly to thwart Clark's 1888 bid for the [[Montana Territory's At-large congressional district  and support Republican [[Thomas H. Carter  instead.  Despite Clark crying foul, Carter would go on to win. <ref name=""Copper Chorus""/><ref name=""Butte""></ref>  Daly's election maneuvering created a major rift between the Copper Kings, and the next year he would become chairman of the Montana Democratic Party.  He asked for Hammond's support and Hammond responded by delivering a Republican sweep of the Missoula delegation.  This infuriated Daly, who declared war on Hammond and threatened to ""make grass grow in the streets of Missoula.""  Several years later as Montana's press was divided on whether to keep the state's capital in Clark's choice of [[Helena, Montana|Helena  or move it Daly's company town of [[Anaconda, Montana|Anaconda , Hammond who was worried that further empowered Daly would weaken Missoula loaned ''The Missoulian'' to Clark's team who derided Anaconda.  ""What has Anaconda ever done for Missoula, anyway? If Christ came to Anaconda he would be compelled to eat, sleep, drink and pray with Marcus Daly.""  Though the majority of Missoula County voted for Anaconda as capital, enough voted for Helena for it to win the statewide contest. <ref name=""Copper Chorus""/><ref name=""Butte""/>    In 1900, Hammond began selling stock in the Missoulian to political rival [[Joseph M. Dixon  who would later become a [[59th United States Congress|US Congressman , [[60th United States Congress|US Senator , and the state of [[Montana 's seventh [[List of Governors of Montana|governor . In December 1906 Wilhelm's Magazine ''The Coast'' described the newspaper as ""one of the best papers in the state of Montana and has the credit of being a strong paper in all matters pertaining to public and state affairs.  It is large, well edited and a credit to Missoula.""Dixon gained control over the paper in 1907 and brought in Arthur Stone, a former ''Anaconda Standard'' reporter and managing editor as well as former Democratic state legislator, as editor.  His experience would help further modernize the paper and expand its reach.<ref name=""Copper Chorus"">Swibold, Dennis L. Copper chorus: mining, politics, and the Montana press, 1889-1959  2006 </ref>  The Republican ''Daily Missoulian''  as it would be called until 1961  was soon rivaled by the Democrat-leaning ''Missoula Herald'' published by the Hassler Brothers and its successor the ''Missoula Sentinel'' that was purchased in 1912  one year after its founding  by Richard Kilroy for the purpose of politically wounding Dixon as he ran for re-election in the first year [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Senators were popularly elected .  *note. Though the  [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|17th Amendment to the Constitution  was not ratified until 1913, the Montana legislature provided for the direct election of US Senators in 1911 in anticipation of the amendment's ratification.   Dixon would lose the election in a Democratic sweep and would lose the paper for financial reasons five years later.  ===Anaconda Copper=== Montana's press in 1912 was almost entirely under the influence and control of the [[Anaconda Copper|Anaconda Copper Mining Company , then known as ""Amalgamated Copper Company"" or, in a nod to its incredible clout in Montana politics and journalism, simply ""The Company"".  The ''Missoulian'' was not a ""Company paper""; according to Jerre Murphy, a former Amalgamated employee turned [[Muchracker|muckracker  it was the only major newspaper in Montana that was not.  After his election defeat Dixon turned the Missoulian against Amalgamated with scathing editorials and ""objectionable"" news.  With Dixon refusing to sell the paper, the Company chose bribery by offering Dixon the ''Missoula Sentinel'' that Dixon felt was splitting the city's advertising dollars.  Dixon accepted, but only on the condition that he would be ""fair"" to Amalgamated in the press.  Pressure on advertisers for new anti-Dixon competition and Amalgamated itself pulling its advertising dollars as well as having the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road  cancel complimentary papers that it had given to passengers, however, forced Dixon to sell.  In two newspapermen from the ''Chicago Journal'', Martin Hutchens and Lester L. Jones purchased the Missoulian and was soon part of the ""copper press""  i.e. a ""Company paper"" known for using its pages to promote the Company's views and for suppressing news it didn’t want reported  and would remain as such until Anaconda Copper sold all its Montana newspapers to [[Lee Enterprises  in 1959.<ref name=""Copper Chorus""/>  ===Lee Enterprises=== By the late 1950s, the Anaconda Company's newspaper model of toeing the company line and avoiding controversy had left the company's papers self-conscious and defensive to the point that Don Anderson commented in its appraisal of the newspapers that ""They even refused to take a stand on the weather.""  When the papers were finally sold in 1959, only the ''[[Billings Gazette '' and ''Missoulian'' were profitable and in growing markets.  Ultimately, the financial difficulties of the company's papers around the state may have helped [[Lee Enterprises , who faced competition from much larger organizations such as the [[Cowles Media Company  and the [[Knight Ridder|Ridder Corporation , purchase the newspaper block.  Larger publishers were only interested in the two profitable papers while the Anaconda Company insisted on selling the papers as a block with an implicit guarantee that individual papers not be sold off to recoup losses.  Also in Lee Enterprises' favor was that Don Anderson, publisher of the [[Wisconsin State Journal  and later president of Lee Newspapers in Montana who in 2007 would have the new [[University of Montana School of Journalism  building named after him, was a Montana native who understood the political climate and had worked with Anaconda Company staff as a young reporter.  He and Lee Enterprises' CEO Phillip Adler successfully purchased the papers despite not being the highest bidders with an agreement made in late May.  The newspapers each announced the change in ownership with a ""hello"" on June 2, 1959 stressing that they would be accountable to the public and not their parent company.<ref name=""Copper Chorus""/>  While most of Lee Enterprises' new newspapers retained their leadership, the ''Missoulian'' was an exception where [[Lloyd Schermer , son-in-law of Phillip Adler, took over as publisher.<ref name=""Copper Chorus""/>  ==Name and organization== The ''Missoulian'' began as the weekly ''Missoula & Cedar Creek Pioneer'' in 1870 before being renamed ''The Missoula Pioneer'' in 1871, but under the Montana Publishing Company.  It was rechristened ''The Pioneer'' later in 1871 by the Pioneer Publishing Company and then ''The Montana Pioneer'' near the end of 1872 by Washington J. McCormick, Sr. before being purchased by [[Frank H. Woody|Frank Woody  and T. M. Chisholm a couple months later and renamed ''The Weekly Missoulian''.  This would remain its carnation through 1898.<ref name=""Chronicling America"">[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/titles/results/?state=Montana&county=Missoula&city=Missoula&year1=1690&year2=2012&terms=&frequency=&language=&ethnicity=&labor=&material_type=&lccn=&rows=20 US Newspaper Directory Search Results: Missoulian - Chronicling America  The Library of Congress <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  ''The Weekly Missoulian'' continued for a year  January 1899 – April 1900  as ''The Missoulian''  still as a weekly newspaper , published by Bryan Bros. & Hauck.  The weekly newspaper was then purchased by the Fruit-Grower Publishing Company and existed as a horticulture and general news publication until the mid-1910s.  In 1889 Harrison Spaulding founded ''The Morning Missoulian'' as a daily  minus Monday  paper to compliment ''The Weekly Missoulian''.  By 1893, this was changed to ''The Evening Missoulian'' and then to the ''Daily Missoulian'' under the Missoula Publishing Company with Harrison Spaulding as editor.  After brief separate ownership, both the daily and weekly ''Missoulian''s were reclaimed by the Missoula Publishing Company with ''The Daily Missoulian'' lasting until 1961, when it was once again called the ''Missoulian'' after being purchased by [[Lee Enterprises .<ref name=""Chronicling America""/>  ===Timeline===  '''Weekly'''<ref name=""Chronicling America""/> * Missoula and Cedar Creek pioneer -  September 1870   * The Missoula Pioneer -  January 1871  <!-- - 4 pages - Saturday - Pioneer Publishing Co - 550 circulation  Rowell's American newspaper directory 1872 --> * The Pioneer -  November 1871  * The Montana Pioneer -  December 1872  * The Weekly Missoulian -  February 1873  <!-- 4 pages - Friday, 24x36 - Chauncey Barbour - 400 circulation  1880 --> * The Missoulian -  January 1899  * Edwards' fruit grower & farmer -  December 1901  * Semi-weekly Missoulian -  September 1902  * Weekly Missoulian -  January 1904 - 1915   '''Daily''' * The Morning Missoulian -  1889  * The Evening Missoulian -  February 1893  * Daily Missoulian -  August 1894  * The Missoulian -  May 1900  * The Daily Missoulian -  November 1904  * The Missoulian -  June 1910  * The Daily Missoulian -  March 1915  * Missoulian -  September 1961   ==See also== * [[Missoula, Montana   ==References==   == Further reading == * The Missoulian Western Montana Progress, 1894-1889-1964.

As the primary paper of the state's capital, the ''Times-Dispatch'' serves as a newspaper of record for rural regions of the state that lack large local papers. The ''Times-Dispatch'' lists itself as ""Virginia's News Leader"" on its [[Masthead  publishing |masthead .  ==History and notable accomplishments== ===Development=== Although the ''Richmond Compiler'' published in Virginia's capitol beginning in 1815, and merged with a later newspaper called ''The Times'', the ''Times and Compiler'' failed in 1853, despite an attempt of former banker [[James A. Cowardin  and William H. Davis to revive it several years before. In 1850, Cowardin and Davis established a rival newspaper called the ''Richmond Dispatch'', and by 1852 the ''Dispatch'' bragged of having circulation three times as large as any other daily paper in the city, and advertising dominated even its front page. Cowardin began his only term in the [[Virginia House of Delegates   as a [[Whig Party  United States |Whig   in 1853, but many thought the city's pre-eminent paper the [[Richmond Examiner . John Hammersley bought half of the newspaper company in 1859, and continued as a joint publisher on the masthead until May 5, 1862, when no name appeared. By April 1861, the newspaper announced its circulation was “within a fraction of 13,000.”  The newspaper had been staunchly pro-slavery since 1852, and called Union soldiers ""thieves and cut-throats"". Most of its wartime issues are now available online. In 1864, Hammersley brought new presses from England, having run the Union blockade, although he sold half his interest to James W. Lewellen before his dangerous departure  presumably through [[Wilmington, North Carolina , the last Southern port open to Confederate vessels in 1864 .   The ''Richmond Daily Dispatch'' published its last wartime issue on April 1, 1865; and its office was destroyed the next night during the fire set by Confederate soldiers as they left the city. However, it resumed publication on December 9, 1865, establishing a new office at 12th and Main Streets and accepting [[Henry K. Ellyson  as part-owner as well as editor. By 1866, the ''Dispatch'' was one of five papers ""carrying prestige from ante bellum days"" published in Richmond  of 7 newspapers . Although the newspaper initially opposed the [[Ku Klux Klan , the ''Richmond Dispatch'' accepted Klan advertising in 1868, as it fought [[Congressional Reconstruction  and the [[Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868 . However, it later accepted the resulting state constitution  after anti-Confederate provisions were stripped  as well as allowing Negroes on juries and in the legislature. Ellyson briefly served as Richmond's mayor in 1870, selected by Richmond's city council appointed by Governor [[Gilbert C. Walker . After what some called the ""Municipal War"" because the prior appointed mayor [[George Chahoon  refused to relinquish his office and mob violence and blockades, the Virginia Supreme Court declared Ellyson the mayor but awaited elections. After skullduggery concerning stolen ballots in the pro-Chahoon [[Jackson Ward  and the election commission declared Ellyson the winner, he refused to serve under the resulting cloud, leading to yet another problematic election won by the [[Conservative Party of Virginia  1867 |Conservative Party  candidate. The revived ''Dispatch'' later opposed former Confederate General [[William Mahone  and his [[Readjuster Party . After James Cowardin died in 1882, his son Charles took the helm  with Ellyson's assistance, and with Ellyson family members handling business operations , and the paper stopped supporting Negro rights, instead criticizing Del. [[John Mercer Langston  with racial stereotypes.  In 1886, [[Lewis Ginter  founded the ''Richmond Daily Times''. A year later, lawyer Joseph Bryan  1845-1908  bought the ''Daily Times'' from Ginter, beginning the paper's long association with the Bryan family. Bryan and Ginter had previously helped revitalize the Tanner & Delany Engine Company, transforming it into the [[Richmond Locomotive Works , which had 800 employees by 1893 and built 200 locomotives per year. In 1890, the ''Daily Times'' changed its name to the ''Richmond Times''. In 1896, Bryan acquired the eight-year-old rival ''Manchester Leader'' and launched the ''Evening Leader''. In 1899, the evening ''Richmond News'' was founded. John L. Williams, owner of the ''Dispatch'', bought the ''News'' in 1900.  By 1903, it was obvious Richmond was not big enough to support four papers. That year, Williams and Bryan agreed to merge Richmond's main newspapers. The morning papers merged to become the ''Richmond Times-Dispatch'' under Bryan's ownership, while the evening papers merged to become ''[[The Richmond News Leader '' under Williams' ownership. Bryan bought the ''News Leader'' in 1908, but died later that year.  [[Joseph Bryan Park  was donated by his widow, Isobel  ""Belle""  Stewart Bryan, and named for him .  His son John Stewart Bryan had given up his own legal career in 1900 to become a reporter working for the ''Dispatch'' and helped found the [[Associated Press  and then became vice-president of the publishing company. Upon his father's death, John Stewart Bryan became owner and publisher of the two papers, but in 1914 sold a controlling interest in the ''Times-Dispatch'' to three families. He hired [[Douglas Southall Freeman  as editor of the ''News Leader'' in 1915, and remained in control until becoming President of the [[College of William and Mary  in 1934  and publishing a biography of his father the following year . John Stewart Bryan   but reacquired the ''Times-Dispatch'' in 1940 when the two papers' business interests merged to form Richmond Newspapers, in which Bryan held a 54-percent interest. That conglomeration is now known as [[Media General . Other publishers in the Bryan family include D. Tennant Bryan and John Stewart Bryan III.   On June 1, 1992, four days after its sponsored contestant [[Amanda Goad  won the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee , the ''News Leader'', which had been losing circulation for many years, ceased publication and was folded into the ''Times-Dispatch.''  ===2004 Mosul attack=== The ''Richmond Times-Dispatch'' drew national attention for its coverage of a December 21, 2004, attack by a [[suicide bomber  on an American military base in [[Mosul , [[Iraq . The deadliest attack on an American military installation since the war began, the attack injured 69 people and killed 22, including two with the [[Army National Guard|Virginia National Guard 's Richmond-based [[276th Engineer Battalion . Stories and photographs about the attack by a ''Times-Dispatch'' reporter [[embedded journalist|embedded  with the 276th were read, heard and seen across the nation.  ===Tacky Christmas lights tour=== In 1990, The ''RTD'' borrowed an idea  from a local entrepreneur, Barry ""Mad Dog"" Gottlieb, to encourage a ""Tacky Christmas Lights Tour,"" also known by locals as the ""Tacky Light Tour"". Every week, the ''RTD'' lists the addresses of houses where the most [[taste  sociology |tacky  [[Christmas lights  holiday decoration |Christmas lights  can be found. This tradition has begun to spread to other cities, like [[Fairfax, Virginia   [[Washington, DC|DC area     as well as [[San Francisco  and [[Los Angeles .  ===Media General sells its newspapers=== On May 17, 2012, Media General  announced the sale of its newspaper division to BH Media, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett's [[Berkshire Hathaway  company. The sale included all of Media General's newspapers except ''The Tampa Tribune'' and its associated publications. Berkshire Hathaway bought 63 newspapers for $142 million and, as part of the deal, offered Media General a $400 million term loan at 10.5 percent interest that will mature in 2020 and a $45 million revolving line of credit. Berkshire Hathaway received a seat on Media General's board of directors and an option to purchase a 19.9% stake in the company. The deal closed on June 25, 2012.  ==Political associations== Diane Cantor, the wife of former Republican House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor , sat on Media General's Board of Directors from 2005 to 2017. This drew some conflict-of-interest allegations because the ''RTD'' serves much of the congressman's 7th district, but no evidence surfaced that she was involved in the paper's content. Her association with the paper was noted at the end of ''Times-Dispatch'' stories about Rep. Cantor.  ==Content==  ===Commentary, opinion, and editorials=== A prominent newspaper in the state, the ''Times-Dispatch'' frequently features commentary from important figures from around Virginia, such as officials and presidents from [[Virginia Commonwealth University , the [[College of William and Mary , and the [[University of Virginia . Former Richmond Mayor [[Douglas Wilder , who had articles published in the paper before he held that position, often outlined policies his administration was implementing. During the [[2004 U.S. presidential campaign , its Commentary sections featured some pieces by Retired Admiral [[Roy Hoffmann , a founding member of the [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth  and resident of Richmond suburb [[Chesterfield, Virginia|Chesterfield , against [[Democratic Party  United States |Democratic  candidate [[John Kerry .  Editorially, the ''Times-Dispatch'' has historically leaned [[conservatism|conservative , leading the paper to frequently [[political endorsement|endorse  candidates of the [[Republican Party  United States |Republican Party .  It supported many of former President [[George W. Bush 's policies, including the [[2003 invasion of Iraq  and a [[flat income tax . However, the paper is not unilaterally conservative; for example, a 2005 editorial called for the then [[House Majority Leader  [[Tom DeLay  to relinquish his leadership position on [[ethics|ethical  grounds. There are also some [[liberalism in the United States|liberal  syndicated columnists who appear frequently, especially [[Leonard Pitts .  During the [[Civil Rights Movement , the ''Times-Dispatch'', like nearly every major newspaper in Virginia, was an ardent supporter of [[racial segregation|segregation .  In the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election , the ''Times-Dispatch'' endorsed [[Libertarian Party  United States |Libertarian  candidate [[Gary Johnson  over major party candidates [[Donald Trump  and [[Hillary Clinton . Clinton's running mate, [[Tim Kaine , is a Richmond resident who served as [[mayor of Richmond|mayor of the city  from 1998-2001. From at least 1980 until its Johnson endorsement in 2016, the ''Times-Dispatch'' had only endorsed Republican presidential candidates.  ===Sports=== Like most major papers, the sports section has [[MLB , [[NASCAR , [[Major League Soccer|MLS , [[NBA , [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA , [[NFL , and [[NHL  scores and results. The ''Times-Dispatch'' sports pages naturally focus on Richmond and Virginia professional and college teams, especially [[VCU Rams|VCU , [[Richmond Spiders|Richmond , [[Virginia Cavaliers|Virginia , and [[Virginia Tech Hokies|Virginia Tech . In addition to [[Richmond Flying Squirrels  and [[Richmond Kickers  coverage, readers can see in-depth coverage of the [[Washington Redskins  in the fall and the [[Washington Nationals  in the summer. ""Virginians in the Pros"" and similar features track all sorts of professional athletes who were born, lived in, or attended college in Virginia. Large [[automobile racing  events like the [[Sprint Cup Series|Sprint Cup   at the [[Richmond International Raceway   are often given a separate preview guide.  Catering to the vast array of Virginia [[hunter s, [[Fisherman|fishers , [[hiker s, and outdoorsmen, somewhere between half a page to a whole page most days is dedicated to outdoors articles, written by Lee Graves, who succeeded Garvey Winegar in November 2003. The ""Scoreboard,"" which features minor-league standings, [[Las Vegas Strip|Vegas  betting, and other sports scores, also gives [[tide  measurements, [[river  levels, and [[skiing  conditions, depending on the season.  Virginians have traditionally been highly supportive of high school athletics, and its flagship paper is a testament to that. Particular emphasis is given to [[American football  and [[basketball ; The ''Times-Dispatch'' ranks area teams in these sports, in the style of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA  polls, and generally updates them weekly. In the fall, Sunday editions have the scores of all high school football games played that weekend from across the state. Prep games are also receive above-average coverage in [[baseball , [[Cross country running|cross country , [[golf , [[lacrosse , [[soccer , [[softball , [[swimming  sport |swimming , [[tennis , [[track and field , and [[volleyball . Stories are frequently done on notable prep athletes, such as those from foreign countries, those with disabilities, those who play a multitude of sports, or those who had little or no prior experience in a sport which they now excel in.  ===Business=== The business desk consists of six reporters; they cover technology, retail, energy, insurance, banking, economics, real estate, manufacturing, transportation and consumer issues.  Unlike many newspapers, the ''Times-Dispatch'' produces a widely read Monday business section, Metro Business.  It contains a center cover story on a regional business-related issue and is filled with events for the coming week, advice columnists and gadget reviews.  In June 2006, the decision was made to remove the stock tables from the daily sections beginning July 15 and replace the numerous pages with a ""Markets Review"" section for subscribers who request it.  The stock section was eliminated in 2009, as was the Sunday Real Estate section  both were cost-cutting moves . The Sunday Business section, which had been a showcase of general business-interest stories and features, has been rechristened Moneywise and now features primarily consumer-related coverage. Moneywise is also among select Sunday business sections nationwide that print ''[[Wall Street Journal '' Sunday pages.  ==Controversy== On July 12, 2006, Richmond-based news magazine ''Style Weekly'' ran a cover story  titled ""Truth and Consequences,"" a piece that took a look at the ''Times-Dispatch'''s operations as the paper settled into its first year with new management.  The report described new editor Glenn Proctor, who took over Nov. 14, 2005, as an ""inelegant, blunt and harsh critic — to the point of saying, repeatedly, that some reporters' work 'sucks.'""

MSNBC is owned by the [[NBCUniversal News Group , a unit of the [[NBCUniversal Television Group  division of [[NBCUniversal   all of which are ultimately owned by [[Comcast  . MSNBC and its website were founded in 1996 under a partnership between [[Microsoft  and [[General Electric 's [[NBC  unit, hence the network's naming. Although they had the same name, msnbc.com and MSNBC maintained separate corporate structures and news operations. msnbc.com was headquartered on the Microsoft campus in [[Redmond, Washington  while MSNBC operated out of NBC's headquarters in New York City. Microsoft divested its stakes in the MSNBC channel in 2005 and in msnbc.com in July 2012. The general news site was rebranded as [[NBCNews.com , and a new msnbc.com was created as the online home of the cable channel.  In the late summer of 2015, MSNBC revamped its programming; the moves were in sharp contrast to previous programming decisions at the network. MSNBC sought to sharpen its news image by entering into a dual editorial relationship with its organizational parent NBC News. ''[[MSNBC Live '', the network's flagship daytime news platform, was expanded to cover over eight hours of the day.  [[Phil Griffin  is the president and director of day-to-day operations at MSNBC. Pat Burkey, Janelle Rodriguez, and Jonathan Wald oversee programming and news operations, with [[Brian Williams  serving as the channel's chief anchor of breaking news coverage. As of February 2015, approximately 94,531,000 households in the United States  81.2 percent of those with television  were receiving MSNBC.  Commentators have described MSNBC as having a bias towards left-leaning politics and the Democratic Party. In November 2007, a ''[[New York Times '' article stated that MSNBC's [[prime-time  lineup is tilting more to the left. [[Fox News  media analyst [[Howard Kurtz , while previously in the same role at ''[[The Washington Post '', stated that the channel's evening lineup ""has clearly gravitated to the left in recent years and often seems to regard itself as the antithesis of Fox News"".  ==History==  ===Development=== MSNBC was established under a strategic partnership between [[NBC  and [[Microsoft . NBC executive [[Tom Rogers  executive |Tom Rogers  was instrumental in developing this partnership. James Kinsella, a Microsoft executive, served as president of the online component, MSNBC.com, and represented the tech company in the joint venture. Microsoft invested $221 million for a 50 percent share of the cable channel. MSNBC and Microsoft shared the cost of a $200 million newsroom in [[Secaucus, New Jersey , for [[msnbc.com . The network took over the channel space of NBC's 2-year-old [[America's Talking   AT  network, although in most cases cable carriage had to be negotiated with providers who had never carried AT.  ===Early history=== [[File:OldMSNBCLogo.svg|thumb|right|175px|MSNBC's most well known logo used from 1996 until 2009. The ""N"" in the logo was changed from red to black in 2002. This variant has occasionally been used after 2006 as an alternative logo in a horizontal form.    MSNBC was launched on July 15, 1996. The first show was anchored by [[Jodi Applegate  and included news, interviews, and commentary. During the day, rolling news coverage continued with ''The Contributors'', a show that featured [[Ann Coulter  and [[Laura Ingraham , as well as interactive programming coordinated by Applegate, [[John Gibson  media host |John Gibson , and [[John Seigenthaler Jr.|John Seigenthaler . Stories were generally longer and more detailed than the stories [[CNN  was running. NBC also highlighted their broadcast connections by airing stories directly from NBC's network affiliates, along with breaking news coverage from the same sources.  MSNBC gradually increased its emphasis on politics. After completing its seven-year survey of cable channels, the [[Project for Excellence in Journalism  said in 2007 that, ""MSNBC is moving to make politics a brand, with a large dose of opinion and personality.""<ref name=project>[http://stateofthemedia.org/2007/cable-tv-intro/public-attitude/ The State of the News Media 2007: Public Attitudes] . [[Project for Excellence in Journalism .</ref>  In January 2001, [[Mike Barnicle 's MSNBC show started, but it was canceled in June 2001 because of high production costs. In June, Microsoft chief executive officer [[Steve Ballmer  said that he would not have started MSNBC had he foreseen the difficulty of attracting viewers.  After the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks , NBC used MSNBC as an outlet for the up-to-the-minute coverage being provided by NBC News as a supplement to the longer stories on broadcast NBC. With little financial news to cover, [[CNBC  and [[CNBC Europe  ran MSNBC for many hours each day following the attacks. The year also boosted the profile of [[Ashleigh Banfield , who was present during the collapse of Building 7 while covering the World Trade Center on September 11. Her ''Region In Conflict'' program capitalized on her newfound celebrity and showcased exclusive interviews from [[Afghanistan .  In the aftermath of September 11, MSNBC began calling itself ""America’s NewsChannel"" and hired opinionated hosts like [[Alan Keyes , [[Phil Donahue , [[Pat Buchanan , and [[Tucker Carlson ; This branding makeover, however, was followed by declining ratings.  On December 23, 2005, NBC Universal announced its acquisition of an additional 32 percent share of MSNBC from Microsoft, which solidified its control over television operations and allowed NBC to further consolidate MSNBC's backroom operations with NBC News and its other cable properties.  The news website msnbc.com remained a separate joint venture between Microsoft and NBC for another seven years.  NBC later exercised its option to purchase Microsoft's remaining 18 percent interest in MSNBC.  In late 2005, MSNBC began attracting liberal and progressive viewers as [[Keith Olbermann  began critiquing and satirizing [[conservatism in the United States|conservative  media commentators during his ''Countdown With Keith Olbermann'' program. He especially focused his attention on the [[Fox News Channel  and [[Bill O'Reilly  political commentator |Bill O'Reilly , its principal primetime commentator.  On June 7, 2006, Rick Kaplan resigned as president of MSNBC after holding the post for two years. Five days later, [[Dan Abrams , a nine-year veteran of MSNBC and NBC News, was named general manager of MSNBC with immediate effect. NBC News senior vice president Phil Griffin would oversee MSNBC, while continuing to oversee NBC News’ ''[[Today  U.S. TV program |Today '' program, with Abrams reporting to Griffin.  On June 29, 2006, Abrams announced the revamp of MSNBC's early-primetime and primetime schedule. On July 10, ''[[Tucker  television program |Tucker ''  formerly ''The Situation with Tucker Carlson''  started airing at 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. ET  taking over Abrams' old timeslot , while Rita Cosby's ''[[Rita Cosby: Live & Direct|Live & Direct '' was canceled. Cosby was made the primary anchor for ''MSNBC Investigates'' at 10 and 11 p.m. ET, a new program that took over Cosby and Carlson's timeslots. According to the press release, ''MSNBC Investigates'' promised to ""complement MSNBC's existing programming by building on [the channel's] library of award winning documentaries."" The move to taped programming during 10 and 11 p.m. probably resulted from MSNBC's successful Friday ""experiment"" of replacing all primetime programming with taped specials.  On September 24, 2007, Abrams announced that he was leaving his general manager position so he could focus on his 9:00 p.m. ET talk show, ''Live With Dan Abrams''. Oversight of MSNBC was shifted to Phil Griffin, a senior vice president at NBC.

In September 2008, the channel hired political analyst and [[Air America Radio  personality [[Rachel Maddow  to host a new political opinion program called ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show ''. The move to create a new program for the channel was widely seen as a smart ratings move, where beforehand, MSNBC lagged behind in coveted primetime ratings.

MSNBC issued a statement that it had ended its contract with Olbermann, with no further explanation. Olbermann later revealed that he had taken his show to [[Current TV .  During 2014, MSNBC's total ratings in the 25 to 54 age group declined 20 percent, falling to third place behind CNN. The only demographic in which MSNBC still led was among Hispanics and even more so among African-Americans.  ===Return to hard news and alignment with NBC News: since 2015===  To help revive the struggling network, MSNBC in the summer of 2015 started transitioning from left-leaning, opinionated programming to hard news programming. Nearly all daytime opinionated news programs were replaced with more generic news programs. [[Ronan Farrow , [[Joy-Ann Reid , [[Krystal Ball , [[Touré , [[Abby Huntsman , [[Alex Wagner , [[Ed Schultz , and [[Al Sharpton  lost their shows. News programs presented by established NBC News personalities such as [[Telemundo  anchor [[Jose Diaz-Balart , ''[[Meet the Press '' anchor [[Chuck Todd , Sunday NBC Nightly News anchor [[Kate Snow , [[Thomas Roberts  television journalist |Thomas Roberts , and former NBC Nightly News anchor [[Brian Williams  replaced the opinion shows. The revamped on-air presentation debuted in late summer 2015 and included a new logo, news ticker, and graphics package. ''MSNBC Live'' had at least eight hours of programming each day, barring any breaking news that could extend its time.  Daytime news coverage was led primarily by Brian Williams, [[Stephanie Ruhle , Jose Diaz-Balart, Andrea Mitchell, Craig Melvin, Thomas Roberts, and Kate Snow, in addition to ""beat leaders"" stationed throughout the newsroom. These included chief legal correspondent [[Ari Melber , primary political reporter [[Steve Kornacki , business and finance correspondent [[Olivia Sterns , and senior editor [[Cal Perry . Morning and primetime programming did not change and remained filled mostly by opinionated personalities.  In April 2016, MSNBC launched a promotional ad campaign with the theme, ""in order to know beyond, you have to go beyond."" The campaign portrayed MSNBC's reporting and perspectives as ""in depth"" and an alternative to ""talking points"" coverage on other cable news outlets.  In July 2016, the network debuted ''Dateline Extra'', which was an abridged version of ''[[Dateline NBC '' and another step towards aligning MSNBC and NBC News. The new program was hosted by ''MSNBC Live'' anchor [[Tamron Hall .  In September 2016, MSNBC launched ''[[The 11th Hour  news program |The 11th Hour with Brian Williams '' as a nightly wrap-up of the day's news and a preview of the following day's headlines. This was MSNBC's first new primetime program in nearly four years.  In January 2017, MSNBC debuted a program in the 6 pm EST hour entitled ''[[For the Record with Greta '', hosted by former Fox News Channel anchor [[Greta Van Susteren . The program aired for six months before being cancelled in late June 2017. The network promoted Chief legal Correspondent Ari Melber to host ''[[The Beat with Ari Melber '' at 6pm.  In March 2017, MSNBC started rebranding their daytime shows as ""NBC News"" programs. The network logos started appearing on show opens, within the set design, and in commercials. In May 2017, MSNBC launched a 4pm afternoon program entitled ''[[Deadline: White House '' and hosted by former White House communications director and NBC political analyst [[Nicolle Wallace .   For the first time, MSNBC in May 2017 became the highest rated American cable news network in primetime. MSNBC's increasing viewership was accompanied by declining numbers at Fox News Channel. MSNBC's May 15–19 programming topped the programming of both CNN and Fox News in total viewers and the advertiser-coveted younger demographic.  Another significant change was made in April 16, 2018, when MSNBC completely removed the [[news ticker  at the bottom of the screen on every program, citing the reason ""for a cleaner view that puts our reporting more front and center ... and we want viewers to get the best possible experience"". At the time of the change, CNN is still running the news ticker during live programming  although its sister network [[HLN  TV network |HLN  does not , meanwhile Fox News only scraps the news ticker during daytime news programs.  ==Notable personalities==   * [[Peter Alexander  journalist |Peter Alexander  * [[Mariana Atencio  * [[Mika Brzezinski  * [[Josh Barro  * [[Jeremy Bash  * [[John O.

One of several reasons for this was an exclusive carriage agreement between MSNBC and Cablevision that prohibited competing wired providers from carrying MSNBC. The terms of the agreement were not publicly known.  In 2009, Verizon filed a formal ""program-access complaint"" with the [[Federal Communications Commission  and petitioned for termination of the deal. In support of Verizon, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal argued that the arrangement could be illegal. After entering into a new contract, FiOS added the channel in New York City and New Jersey on February 2, 2010.  ==International broadcasts== [[File:111907f.jpg|thumb|left|The monitors of the MSNBC newsroom are tuned into various global channels.

MSNBC cited the growing criticism that they were ""too opinionated to be seen as neutral in the heat of the presidential campaign.""<ref name=""washingtonpost.com""></ref><ref name=""nytimes.com""></ref> Olbermann's show ''Countdown'' continued to run before and after the presidential and vice presidential debates, and both Matthews and Olbermann joined Gregory on the channel's election night coverage.  On November 13, 2009, in the days leading up to the release of 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin 's book ''[[Going Rogue: An American Life|Going Rogue '', MSNBC's [[Dylan Ratigan  used [[photoshopping|photoshopped  pictures of Palin on the channel's ''[[Morning Meeting with Dylan Ratigan|Morning Meeting '' program. Ratigan apologized a few days later.  In October 2010, MSNBC began using the tagline ""Lean Forward"". Some media outlets, including msnbc.com, claimed that the network was now embracing its politically progressive identity.<ref name=""msnbc.msn.com""/>   In January 2012, MSNBC used Rachel Maddow, Chris Matthews, and other network commentators during its coverage of the [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2012|Iowa Republican caucuses . Nando Di Fino of the [[Mediaite  website said MSNBC was  ""giving up on the straight news coverage, and instead [appearing] to be aiming to create some controversy.""  In November 2012, ''The New York Times'' called MSNBC ""The Anti-Fox"" and quoted former President Bill Clinton as saying, ""Boy, it really has become our version of Fox."" Citing data from the [[A.C. Nielsen  TV ratings service, the article noted that while the Fox News Channel had a larger overall viewership than MSNBC, the two networks were separated by only around 300,000 viewers among the 25–54 age bracket most attractive to advertisers.  In the [[Pew Research Center 's 2013 ""State of the News Media"" report, MSNBC was found to be the most opinionated news network, with 85 percent of the content being commentary or opinions and the remaining 15 percent being factual reporting. The report also stated that in 2012, MSNBC spent only $240 million on news production compared to CNN's $682 million and the Fox News Channel's $820 million.  Others have argued that MSNBC has a bias against progressive politics. [[Phil Donahue 's show was canceled in 2003 due to his opposition to the Iraq War, and Donahue later commented that the management of MSNBC required that ""we have two conservative  guests  for every liberal. I was counted as two liberals."" [[Cenk Uygur , after his departure from MSNBC in 2011, said that MSNBC management had told him ""people in Washington"" were ""concerned about [his] tone,"" and that he ""didn't want to work in a place that didn't challenge power.""  ====Favoritism towards Barack Obama==== Some Democratic Party supporters, including former Pennsylvania governor [[Ed Rendell  and Bill Clinton advisor [[Lanny Davis , criticized MSNBC during and after the [[Democratic Party  United States  presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic Party primaries  as covering [[Barack Obama  more favorably than [[Hillary Clinton . Rendell said, ""MSNBC was the official network of the Obama campaign,"" and called their coverage ""absolutely embarrassing"".<ref name=Rendell>[http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0808/Rendell_Obama_coverage_was_embarrassing.html Rendell: Obama coverage was embarrassing].

''[[The New Republic '' published May 27, 2008. Retrieved August 24, 2008. </ref> Rendell later became an on-air contributor to MSNBC.  A study done by the [[Project for Excellence in Journalism  showed that MSNBC had less negative coverage of Obama  14 percent of stories versus 29 percent in the press overall  and more negative stories about Republican presidential candidate [[John McCain   73 percent of its coverage versus 57 percent in the press overall . MSNBC's on-air slogan during the week of the 2008 presidential election, ""The Power of Change"", was criticized for being too similar to Obama's campaign slogan of ""Hope and Change"". After the election, conservative talk show host [[John Ziegler  talk show host |John Ziegler  made a documentary entitled ''Media Malpractice.... How Obama Got Elected'', which was very critical of the media's role, especially MSNBC's, in the election. While promoting the documentary, he had an on-air dispute with MSNBC news anchor [[Contessa Brewer  about how the media, especially MSNBC, had portrayed Sarah Palin.  During MSNBC's coverage of the Potomac primary, MSNBC's Chris Matthews said, ""I have to tell you, you know, it's part of reporting this case, this election, the feeling most people get when they hear Barack Obama's speech. My, I felt this thrill going up my leg. I mean, I don't have that too often."" This led Fox News to assert that both he and MSNBC were biased toward Obama.  ====''Rise of the New Right'' documentary==== In June 2010, the MSNBC documentary ''Rise of the New Right'' aired. It featured interviews with [[Right-wing figure|right-wing  figures, including [[Dick Armey , the former House majority Leader, [[Orly Taitz , a leading figure in the ""[[birther "" movement, and [[conspiracy theorist  radio host [[Alex Jones  radio host |Alex Jones . The documentary also showed the [[Michigan Militia 's [[Survivalism|survival  training camp and hit the campaign trail with Kentucky senatorial candidate [[Rand Paul .<ref name=""WeigelNewReight""></ref>  The documentary angered [[Tea Party movement  figures and others on the right. After the documentary aired, [[FreedomWorks , chaired by Armey, called for a boycott of [[Dawn  brand |Dawn  and [[Procter & Gamble , which advertised during ''Hardball with Chris Matthews''. The boycott was ineffective as Procter & Gamble continued to advertise on the show.  ====Romney coverage during 2012 election==== A study by the [[Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism found that MSNBC's coverage of [[Mitt Romney  during the final week of the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential campaign   68 percent negative with no positive stories in the sample , was far more negative than the overall press, and even more negative than it had been during October 1 to 28, when 5 percent was positive and 57 percent was negative. On the other hand, their coverage of Barack Obama improved in the final week before the presidential election. From October 1 to 28, 33 percent of stories were positive and 13 percent negative. During the campaign's final week, 51 percent of MSNBC's stories were positive while there were no negative stories at all about Obama in the sample.  ===Romney family grandchild===  Political commentator [[Melissa Harris-Perry  and her guest panel, in a look back on the 2013 segment of [[Melissa Harris-Perry  TV program |her show , featured a picture of former Republican presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney  and his extended family. Romney was holding on his knee his adopted grandchild, Kieran Romney, an African-American. Harris-Perry and her guests, including actress Pia Glenn and comedian [[Dean Obeidallah , joked about coming up with captions for the photo. Glenn sang out, ""One of these things is not like the others, one of these things just isn’t the same."" Obeidallah said, ""It sums up the diversity of the Republican Party and the [Republican National Committee], where they have the whole convention and they find the one black person."" Afterwards, Harris-Perry gave an on-air apology as well as apologized in a series of [[Twitter|tweets .  ===Suspensions of hosts===  ====Michael Savage==== During the spring and early summer of 2003, MSNBC featured a weekend talk show hosted by conservative radio host [[Michael Savage  commentator |Michael Savage . In July of that year, Savage responded to a prank caller on his show by calling him a ""pig"" and a ""sodomite"", and telling him he ""should get [[AIDS  and die."" Savage's show was canceled and Savage was fired from the channel shortly afterward  with some reports placing the termination immediately after the episode in question ended .  ====Don Imus l==== In early April 2007, [[Don Imus , whose radio show ''[[Imus in the Morning '' was simulcast on MSNBC for over ten years, described members of the [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights women's basketball|Rutgers University women's basketball team  as ""some nappy-headed hoes."" The comments sparked outrage, as many considered them to be racist and sexist. After sponsors began to withdraw advertisements from the show, MSNBC canceled the simulcast. Imus, as well as NBC News, apologized to the Rutgers Basketball team for the remarks. The television simulcast of Imus' program later moved to [[RFD-TV  until August 2009 and then to [[Fox Business Network  until May 2015.  ====Keith Olbermann and Joe Scarborough==== On November 5, 2010, MSNBC President Phil Griffin suspended Keith Olbermann indefinitely without pay for contributing $2,400  the maximum personal donation limit  to each of three Democratic Party candidates during the 2010 midterm election cycle. NBC News policy prohibited contributions to political campaigns unless NBC News had given its prior permission. On November 7, 2010, Olbermann posted a thank you message to supporters via Twitter. That same day, MSNBC announced that he would be back on the air starting on November 9.  Two weeks later, Griffin announced the suspension of [[Joe Scarborough  for the same offense, as the ''Morning Joe'' host had donated $4,000 to Republican candidates in Florida. Like Olbermann's suspension, Scarborough's suspension was brief, and he returned to the airwaves on November 24. On January 21, 2011, MSNBC announced that Olbermann would host his final show that same night.  ====Martin Bashir==== Host [[Martin Bashir  resigned after making a controversial comment about Sarah Palin. On November 15, 2013, Bashir criticized Palin for equating the [[National debt of the United States|federal debt  to slavery. Bashir referred to the cruel and barbaric punishment of slaves as described by [[Slavery in the United States|slave overseer  [[Thomas Thistlewood , specifically a punishment called ""[[Derby's dose "", which forced slaves to defecate or urinate into the mouth of another slave. Bashir then said, ""When Mrs. Palin invokes slavery, she doesn't just prove her rank ignorance. She confirms if anyone truly qualified for a dose of discipline from Thomas Thistlewood, she would be the outstanding candidate.""  ====Alec Baldwin==== [[Alec Baldwin 's 2013 show ''[[Up Late with Alec Baldwin '' was suspended after five episodes because of a [[homophobic slurs|homophobic slur  Baldwin made to a photographer in New York City.  ====Phil Donahue====   [[Phil Donahue 's 2002 program ''[[Donahue  2002 talk show |Donahue '' was canceled in late February 2003 during the buildup to the [[Iraq War . Despite earlier claims of cancellation because of low ratings, ''Donahue'' was MSNBC's highest rated show that month.<ref name=AllYourTV></ref>  A leaked NBC internal study revealed that the studio was concerned that Donahue would act as ""a home for the liberal antiwar agenda at the same time that our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity.""<ref name=""AllYourTV""/>  ==References==   ==Sources== *   ==External links==  *  * [https://www.youtube.com/user/msnbcleanforward Official YouTube channel]             [[Category:MSNBC|   [[Category:24-hour television news channels in the United States  [[Category:American news websites  [[Category:Companies based in New York City  [[Category:English-language television stations in the United States  [[Category:Liberalism in the United States  [[Category:NBCUniversal networks  [[Category:Progressivism in the United States  [[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1996 ","MSNBC is an American pay television network that provides news coverage and political commentary from NBC News on current events. MSNBC is owned by the NBCUniversal News Group, a unit of the NBCUniversal Television Group division of NBCUniversal  all of which are ultimately owned by Comcast . MSNBC and its website were founded in 1996 under a partnership between Microsoft and General Electric's NBC unit, hence the network's naming. Although they had the same name, msnbc.com and MSNBC maintained separate corporate structures and news operations. msnbc.com was headquartered on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington while MSNBC operated out of NBC's headquarters in New York City. Microsoft divested its stakes in the MSNBC channel in 2005 and in msnbc.com in July 2012. The general news site was rebranded as NBCNews.com, and a new msnbc.com was created as the online home of the cable channel.In the late summer of 2015, MSNBC revamped its programming; the moves were in sharp contrast to previous programming decisions at the network. MSNBC sought to sharpen its news image by entering into a dual editorial relationship with its organizational parent NBC News. MSNBC Live, the network's flagship daytime news platform, was expanded to cover over eight hours of the day.Phil Griffin is the president and director of day-to-day operations at MSNBC. Pat Burkey, Janelle Rodriguez, and Jonathan Wald oversee programming and news operations, with Brian Williams serving as the channel's chief anchor of breaking news coverage. As of February 2015, approximately 94,531,000 households in the United States  81.2 percent of those with television  were receiving MSNBC.Commentators have described MSNBC as having a bias towards left-leaning politics and the Democratic Party. In November 2007, a New York Times article stated that MSNBC's prime-time lineup is tilting more to the left. Fox News media analyst Howard Kurtz, while previously in the same role at The Washington Post, stated that the channel's evening lineup ""has clearly gravitated to the left in recent years and often seems to regard itself as the antithesis of Fox News""."

""The Miami Herald 3511 NW 91 Ave. Miami, FL 33172""</ref> Founded in 1903, it is the second largest newspaper in [[Miami metropolitan area|South Florida , serving [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade , [[Broward County, Florida|Broward , and [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe  Counties. It also circulates throughout [[Latin America  and the [[Caribbean .  ==Overview== The newspaper employs over 800 people in Miami and across several bureaus, including [[Bogotá , [[Managua , [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee , [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach , [[Key West, Florida|Key West , another shared space in McClatchy's [[Washington, DC|Washington  bureau.

The newspaper averages 88 pages daily and 212 pages on Sundays.  The ''Miami Herald''s coverage of Latin American and [[Hispanic  affairs is widely considered among the best of U.S. newspapers.  The ''Miami Herald'' also participates in ""Politifact Florida"", a website that focuses on the truth about Florida issues, along with the ''[[Tampa Bay Times '', which created the Politifact concept. The ''Herald'' and the ''Times'' share resources on news stories related to Florida.  ==History== [[File:Miami Herald 07 August 1945.jpg|thumb|left|A ''Miami Herald'' headline dated August 7, 1945 featuring the [[atomic bombing  of [[Hiroshima, Japan    ===Early history===  The first edition was published September 15, 1903, as ''The Miami Evening Record''. After the recession of 1907, the newspaper had severe financial difficulties. Its largest creditor was [[Henry Flagler . Through a loan from Henry Flagler, Frank B. Shutts, who was also the founder of the law firm [[Shutts & Bowen , acquired the paper and renamed it the ''Miami Herald'' on December 1, 1910. Although it is the longest continuously published newspaper in Miami, the earliest newspaper in the region was ''[[The Tropical Sun '', established in 1891. ''The Miami Metropolis'', which later became ''[[The Miami News '', was founded in 1896, and was the ''Herald''s oldest competitor until 1988, when it went out of business.  During the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s , the ''Miami Herald'' was the largest newspaper in the world, as measured by lines of advertising. During [[The Great Depression  in the 1930s, the ''Herald'' came close to [[receivership , but recovered.  On October 25, 1939, [[John S. Knight , son of a noted [[Ohio  newspaperman, bought the ''Herald'' from Frank B. Shutts. Knight became editor and publisher, and made his brother, [[James L. Knight , the business manager. The ''Herald'' had 383 employees. [[Lee Hills  journalist |Lee Hills  arrived as city editor in September 1942. He later became the ''Herald''s publisher and eventually the chairman of [[Knight Ridder|Knight-Ridder Inc. , a position he held until 1981.  ===Post-war history=== ''The Miami Herald International Edition'', printed by partner newspapers throughout the [[Caribbean  and [[Latin America , began in 1946. It is commonly available at resorts in the Caribbean countries such as [[the Dominican Republic , and, though printed by the largest local newspaper ''[[Listín Diario '', it is not available outside such tourist areas. It was extended to Mexico in 2002.  The ''Herald'' won its first Pulitzer Prize in 1950, for its reporting on Miami's [[organized crime . Its circulation was 176,000 daily and 204,000 on Sundays.  On August 19, 1960, construction began on the ''Herald'' building on [[Biscayne Bay . Also on that day, [[Alvah Chapman, Jr.|Alvah H. Chapman , started work as James Knight's assistant. Chapman was later promoted to Knight-Ridder chairman and chief executive officer. The ''Herald'' moved into its new building at One Herald Plaza without missing an edition on March 23–24, 1963.  The paper won a landmark press freedom decision in ''[[Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo ''  1974 .<ref name=obit>|accessdate=April 24, 2013 </ref> In the case, a political candidate, Pat Tornillo Jr., had requested that the ''Herald'' print his rebuttal to an editorial criticizing him, citing Florida's ""right-to-reply"" law, which mandated that newspapers print such responses. Represented by longtime counsel [[Dan Paul , the ''Herald'' challenged the law, and the case was appealed to the Supreme Court.<ref name=""CampbellMartin2012""></ref> The Court unanimously overturned the Florida statute under the Press Freedom Clause of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment , ruling that ""Governmental compulsion on a newspaper to publish that which 'reason' tells it should not be published is unconstitutional."" The decision showed the limitations of a 1969 decision, ''[[Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission '', in which a similar ""[[Fairness Doctrine "" had been upheld for radio and television, and establishing that broadcast and print media had different Constitutional protections.<ref name=""CampbellMartin2012""/>  Publication of a [[Spanish-language  supplemental insert named ''El Herald'' began in 1976. It was renamed ''[[El Nuevo Herald '' in 1987, and in 1998 became an independent publication.  ===Recent history and Arthur Teele suicide=== In 2003, the ''Miami Herald'' and ''[[El Universal  Mexico City |El Universal '' of Mexico City created an international joint venture, and in 2004 they together launched ''[[The Herald Mexico '', a short-lived [[English-language  newspaper for readers in Mexico. Its final issue was published in May 2007.  On July 27, 2005, former Miami city commissioner [[Arthur Teele  walked into the main lobby of the ''Herald''s headquarters and phoned ''Herald'' columnist [[Jim DeFede   one of several telephone conversations that the two had had during the day  to say that he had a package for DeFede. He then asked a security officer to tell his  Teele's  wife Stephanie that he loved her, before pulling out a gun and committing [[suicide .<ref name=""Carlson2005""></ref> This happened the day the ''[[Miami New Times '', a weekly newspaper, published salacious details of Teele's alleged affairs, including allegations that he had had sex and used [[cocaine  with a [[transsexual  [[prostitute .  The day before committing suicide, Teele had had another telephone conversation with DeFede, who recorded this call without Teele's knowledge, which was illegal under Florida law. DeFede admitted to the ''Herald''s management that he had taped the call. Although the paper used quotes from the tape in its coverage, DeFede was fired the next day for violating the paper's code of ethics, and he was likely guilty of a felony.  Many journalists and readers of the ''Herald'' disagreed with the decision to fire rather than suspend DeFede, arguing that it had been made in haste and that the punishment was disproportionate to the offense. 528 journalists, including about 200 current and former ''Herald'' staffers, called on the ''Herald'' to reinstate DeFede, but the paper's management refused to back down. The state attorney's office later declined to file charges against the columnist, holding that the potential violation was ""without a  living  victim or a complainant"".  On September 8, 2006, the ''Miami Herald''s president Jesús Díaz, Jr. fired three journalists because they had allegedly been paid by the [[United States government  to work for anti-[[Cuba  [[propaganda  TV and radio channels. The three were Pablo Alfonso, Wilfredo Cancio Isla and Olga Connor.<ref name=""BBC""></ref> Less than a month later, responding to pressure from the Cuban community in Miami, Díaz resigned after reinstating the fired journalists. Nevertheless, he continues to claim that such payments, especially if made from organs of the state, violate the principles of [[Journalism ethics and standards|journalistic independence . At least seven other journalists who do not work at the ''Herald'', namely Miguel Cossio, Carlos Alberto Montaner, Juan Manuel Cao, Ariel Remos, Omar Claro, Helen Aguirre Ferre, Paul Crespo, and Ninoska Perez-Castellón, were also paid for programs on [[Radio Martí  or [[TV Martí ,<ref name=""BBC""/> both financed by the government of the United States through the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors , receiving a total of between $15,000 and $175,000 [[US Dollar|USD  since 2001.

In May 2011, the paper announced it had sold  of [[Biscayne Bay front land surrounding its headquarters in the [[Arts & Entertainment District  of [[Downtown Miami  for $236million, to a Malaysian resort developer, [[Genting Group|Genting Malaysia Berhad .

In November 2018, the ''Herald'' broke the story  that ""in 2007, despite substantial evidence that corroborated  female teenager's  stories of  sexual  abuse by [[Jeffrey Epstein|Epstein , the U.S. attorney in Miami, [[Alexander Acosta , signed off on a secret deal for the multimillionaire, one that ensured he would never spend a day in prison.""

The Wish Book program lets community members who are suffering from hardships ask for help from the paper's readers. Wishes have included asking for donations to buy medical equipment for a sick child, help with renovations to make a home [[wheelchair -accessible, monetary donations to an impoverished family dealing with [[cancer  treatments, and help to an elderly resident wanting to learn how to use a [[computer . Readers may donate to specific causes or to the program at large.  The ''Herald'' also co-sponsors spelling bees and athletic awards in South Florida.   The ""Tropic"" section and its columnist [[Dave Barry  run the [[Herald Hunt , a unique annual [[puzzlehunt  in the Miami area.  ===Miami Herald's Silver Knight Awards=== The Miami Herald Silver Knight Awards is a highly regarded student awards programs.

The publisher has ""a history of badly handled and controversial retractions and publishing decisions"". Nevertheless, both [[Committee on Publication Ethics|COPE  and [[OASPA  have retained Frontiers as members after concerns were raised.<ref name=COPE/>  == History == The first journal published was ''Frontiers in Neuroscience'', which opened for submission as a [[beta release#Beta|beta version  in 2007.<ref name=Schneider2015/> In 2010, Frontiers launched a series of another eleven journals in [[medicine  and [[science . In February 2012, the Frontiers Research Network was launched, a [[social network ing platform for researchers, intended to disseminate the open access articles published in the Frontiers journals, and to provide related conferences, blogs, news, video lectures and job postings.  In February 2013, the [[Nature Publishing Group   NPG  acquired a controlling interest in Frontiers Media.<ref name=""Economist_FrontiersIn""></ref>   NPG is a subsidiary of [[Holtzbrinck Publishing Group .   ''Frontiers for Young Minds'' was launched in November 2013 during the Annual Meeting of the [[Society for Neuroscience  in collaboration with NPG as a web-based science journal that involves young people in the review of scientific articles with the help of scientists who act as mentors.  In early September 2014, Frontiers received the ALPSP Gold Award for Innovation in Publishing from the [[Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers .  ===List of journals=== The Frontiers journals use [[open peer review , where the names of reviewers of accepted articles are made public.<ref name=Helmer/> As of 2015,  16 of their journals had [[impact factors , a number that grew to 24 in 2017.<ref name=WoS></ref> In February 2016, the series contained 54 journals,<ref name=""Spezi""></ref> a number that grew to 59 by 2017. The collection of all the journals in the series is sometimes considered a [[megajournal , as is the [[BioMed Central  series.<ref name=""Spezi""/> Some journals, such as ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience''<ref name=""stm2015""></ref> or  ''Frontiers in Microbiology'' are considered megajournals on their own.    === Controversies ===  In April 2013, ''[[Frontiers in Psychology '' retracted a controversial article linking [[climate change denialism  and ""[[conspiracy theory|conspiracist ideation ""; the retraction was itself also controversial and led to the resignations of at least three editors.  In November 2013 an article in [[SciELO  reported a rejection rate of 20% of manuscripts, compared to ''[[Nature  journal |Nature '' which rejected 90% of them, but also noted that ''Frontiers in Pharmacology of Anti-Cancer Drugs'' did not fall for the [[2013 Science sting|2013 ''Science'' sting .  In late September, ''Frontiers in Public Health'' published a controversial article that supported [[HIV denialism ; three days later the publisher issued a statement of concern and announced an investigation into the review process of the article. It was eventually decided that the article would not be retracted but instead was reclassified as an opinion piece.<ref name=RWstand></ref>  Around November 2014 the collaboration between NPG and Frontiers quietly ended when the two groups ""made the decision ... to make a clean separation and never to mention again that [Nature Publishing Group] has some kind of involvement in Frontiers.""<ref name=""sacking"" />  In May 2015, Frontiers Media removed the entire [[editorial board s of ''Frontiers in Medicine'' and ''Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine'' after [[editor s complained that Frontiers Media staff were ""interfering with editorial decisions and violating core principles of medical publishing"".<ref name=sacking></ref>  In October 2015, Frontiers was added to [[Jeffrey Beall 's list of ""Potential, possible, or probable"" [[Predatory open access publishing|predatory open-access publishers .<ref name=beall-nat></ref><ref name=""scholarlyoa.com""></ref><ref name=Schneider2015></ref>  The inclusion was met with backlash amongst some researchers.<ref name=beall-nat/>  In July 2016 Beall recommended that academics not publish their work in Frontiers journals, stating ""the fringe science published in Frontiers journals stigmatizes the honest research submitted and published there"", and in October of that year Beall reported that reviewers have called the review process ""merely for show"".  In October 2015, Frontiers in collaboration with NPG launched Loop, a research network that is open to be integrated into any publisher’s or academic organization's website, and Loop soon included a collaboration with [[ORCID  to link and synchronize researcher profile information.  The [[Technical University of Madrid  was the first university to link their Loop profile to their institutional website.  Also in October 2015 the [[Committee on Publication Ethics   COPE  said that ""there have been vigorous discussions about, and some editors are uncomfortable with, the editorial processes at Frontiers"" but that ""the processes are declared clearly on the publisher's site and we do not believe there is any attempt to deceive either editors or authors about these processes"".<ref name=COPE> [https://publicationethics.org/newsevents/201510 COPE October 2015 News Index]</ref> Frontiers is a COPE member and one of its employees sits on COPE's council.<ref name=COPE/>  In September 2016 Frontiers demanded that the university where Beall worked force him to retract his claims.<ref name=""schneider""></ref>  In November 2016 a paper linking [[autism and vaccines|vaccines to autism  was retracted from a Frontiers journal.  Also in November 2016, a study published analyzing predatory publishing by gathering datasets with and without Frontiers journals.  In 2017, further editors were removed, allegedly for their rejection rate being high.  A study published in ''[[eLife '' in November 2017 showed that ""women are underrepresented in the peer-review process"", and that ""editors of both genders operate with substantial same-gender preference"".<ref name=Helmer></ref>  In December 2017 [[Retraction Watch|Adam Marcus and Ivan Oransky  wrote in the magazine ''[[Nautilus  science magazine |Nautilus '' that the acceptance rate of manuscripts in Frontiers journals was near 90%.  According to Allison and James Kaufman in the 2018 book ''Pseudoscience: The Conspiracy Against Science'', ""Frontiers has used an in-house journals management software that does not give reviewers the option to recommend the rejection of manuscripts"" and that the ""system is setup to make it almost impossible to reject papers"".  == References ==   ==External links==  *     [[Category:Publishing companies established in 2007  [[Category:Swiss companies established in 2007  [[Category:Open access publishers ","Frontiers Media SA is an academic publisher of peer-reviewed open access scientific journals currently active in science, technology, and medicine.

Run by [[Matt Drudge  with the help of [[Charles Hurt ,<ref name=huffpo512></ref> the site consists mainly of [[hyperlinks|links  to news stories from other outlets about politics, entertainment, and current events; it also has links to many columnists. Occasionally, Drudge authors news stories himself, based on tips.  The Drudge Report originated in 1995 as a weekly subscriber-based email dispatch.<ref name=EoAJ></ref> It was the first news source to break the [[Lewinsky scandal|Monica Lewinsky scandal  to the public, after ''[[Newsweek '' decided to hold its story.<ref name=""scoop""></ref>  ==Origins== The Drudge Report started in 1995 as a [[gossip  column focusing on [[Hollywood  and [[Washington, D.C. <ref name=""Blumenthatl""></ref> Matt Drudge began the email-based newsletter from an apartment in [[Hollywood, California  using his connections with industry and media insiders to break stories, sometimes before they hit the mainstream media. In its early days Drudge maintained the website from his home in [[Miami Beach, Florida , with help from assistants in story selection and headline writing. His first assistant was [[Andrew Breitbart .<ref name=sappell></ref> Breitbart, who described himself as ""Matt Drudge's bitch"",<ref name=""biyatch""></ref> worked the afternoon shift at the Drudge Report,<ref name=""afternoon""></ref> at the same time as running his own website ''breitbart.com'' and another website ''BigHollywood.com'', providing a [[conservative  perspective for people in the Los Angeles entertainment industry.<ref name=""breit-infidel""></ref> [[John Ziegler  talk show host |John Ziegler  has said that Drudge blocked Breitbart from posting content critical of [[Barack Obama  during the 2008 campaign for the US Presidency.  In 2010, Drudge added to the Drudge Report staff former columnist for ''[[The Washington Times '', Joseph Curl.<ref name=CSGD></ref> In 2011, he added to the staff Charles Hurt, most recently the Washington bureau chief of the ''[[New York Post '' and a columnist for ''The Washington Times''.<ref name=huffpo512/> Curl, who served as morning shift editor, left the site in 2014 and, with Drudge's blessing, in January 2015 launched his own aggregator ''Right Read'', for ''The Washington Times''.  Drudge, who began his website in 1997 as a supplement to his [[United States dollar|$ 10 per year e-mail newsletter,<ref name=""porkies""></ref> received national attention in 1996 when he broke the news that [[Jack Kemp  would be Republican [[Bob Dole 's running mate in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1996|1996 US presidential election . In 1998, Drudge made national waves when he broke the news that ''[[Newsweek '' magazine had information on an inappropriate relationship between ""a White House intern"" and President [[Bill Clinton —the [[Monica Lewinsky scandal —but was withholding publication.<ref name=""drudgemonica""></ref><ref name=""newsweekheld""></ref><ref name=""brillscontent""></ref> After Drudge's report came out, ''Newsweek'' published the story.<ref name=""newsweekstory""></ref>  ==Content== The Drudge Report site consists mainly of selected<ref name=""lawyer""></ref> [[hyperlink s to news websites all over the world, each link carrying a headline written by Drudge or his editors. The linked stories are generally hosted on the external websites of mainstream media outlets. It occasionally includes stories written by Drudge himself, usually two or three paragraphs in length. They generally concern a story about to be published in a major magazine or newspaper.  Drudge occasionally publishes [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen , [[Arbitron , and [[Nielsen BookScan|BookScan  ratings, or early election [[exit poll s which are otherwise not made available to the public.  The site carries advertisements which generate the site's revenue. The Drudge Report's advertising is sold by Intermarkets, the [[Vienna, Virginia -based advertising firm.  In April 2009, the [[Associated Press  announced that it would be examining the [[fair use  doctrine, used by sites like [[Google  and the Drudge Report to justify the use of AP content without payment.  On May 4, 2009, the [[US Attorney General 's office issued a warning to employees in [[Massachusetts  not to visit the Drudge Report and other sites because of malicious code contained in some of the advertising on the website. In March 2010, antivirus company [[Avast Software|Avast!  warned that advertising at the Drudge Report, ''[[The New York Times '', [[Yahoo , [[Google , [[MySpace  and other sites carried malware that could infect computers. ""The most compromised ad delivery platforms were Yield Manager and Fimserve, but a number of smaller ad systems, including Myspace, were also found to be delivering malware on a lesser scale"", said Avast Virus Labs.  ==Design== The site's design has seen few changes since its debut in 1997. Drudge has experimented with temporary design tweaks, including using colored text for holidays instead of the standard black throughout the site's existence. It remains entirely written in unscripted [[HTML , with a mostly monochromatic color scheme of black boldface monospaced font text on a plain white background. The Drudge Report has been described by Cheryl Woodard, co-founder of ''PC'', ''[[Macworld '', ''[[PC World  magazine |PC World '' and ''Publish'' magazines, as ""a big, haphazard mishmash of links and photos""<ref name='guide'></ref> and by [[Dan Rahmel  as ""popular despite a plain appearance"".<ref name=""popular5""></ref> The Drudge Report website is simple and, according to Paul Armstrong of ''webwithoutwords.com'', [[retro  in feel. [[Jason Fried  of [[Basecamp  company |Basecamp  called it ""one of the best designed sites on the web"". It consists of a banner headline and a number of other selected headlines in three columns in [[Monospaced font|monospaced  [[font . Most link to an outside source, usually the online edition of a newspaper, which hosts the story. When no such source is available, either because the story is ""developing"", with little known details at the time, or is an exclusive scoop, a special page is created on the Drudge Report servers, which contains text and sometimes images.  Stories on the site are ascribed different levels of importance, which Matt Drudge rates at his editorial discretion. The ''Report'' almost always holds one major story above the logo, usually just one sentence hyperlinked to the most important story of the day. Other stories surrounding the main headline can be found in the upper left-hand side of the page and link to more specific articles dealing with aspects of the headline story. The standard story, either the headline or links below the logo, is written in black.  The newest stories and those Drudge considers most important are in red, all under a single major headline in large bold type. For especially important breaking stories, especially if they are still emerging, Drudge places art of a flashing red light on the screen.  Although the site initially featured very few images, it is now usually illustrated with five or six photographs. Generally the images, like the linked headlines, are [[Hotlinking|hotlinked  from the servers of other news agencies. The photos were changed from color to [[grayscale|black and white  in August 2017.  ==Political leanings== Matt Drudge has said that he is a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative , but ""more of a [[populism|populist "".<ref name=""miaminewtimes""></ref> Some regard the Drudge Report as conservative in tone,<ref name=""FT-cons""></ref><ref name=""w-times-cons""></ref><ref name=""edandpub""></ref><ref name=""mediap""></ref><ref name=""cjon""></ref><ref name=""rawcon""></ref> and it has been referred to in the media as ""a conservative news aggregator"". In 2008, Richard Siklos, an editor of ''[[Fortune  magazine |Fortune '' magazine, called the Drudge Report a ""conservative bullhorn"".<ref name=""siklos""></ref> Peter Wallsten, writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times '', labelled Drudge a ""well-known conservative warrior""; Saul Hansell, writing in ''[[The New York Times '', referred to him as a ""conservative muckraker"";<ref name=""muck""></ref> and [[Glenn Greenwald , writing in the ''[[New York Magazine '', called him a ""right-wing [[hack writer|hack "".<ref name=""nymagx""></ref> Greenwald also wrote that the Drudge Report—inter alia—is part of the ""Bush/Cheney right-wing noise machine"".  Jesse Swick of ''[[The New Republic '' notes that the Drudge Report frequently links to stories that [[climate change denial|cast doubt  upon global warming. ""[Drudge] loves a press release from Senator [[James Inhofe|Inhofe  almost as much as he loves taking pot shots at [[Al Gore  ... It's like flashing tasty images of popcorn and sodas between frames at movie theaters, only much less subtle."" [[Ben Shapiro  wrote, ""The American left can't restrict Internet usage or ban talk radio, so it de-legitimizes these news sources. Ripping alternative news sources as illegitimate is the left's only remaining option -- it cannot compete with the right wing in the new media ... They call Matt Drudge a muckraker and a [[yellow journalism|yellow journalist .""  A study in 2005 placed the Drudge Report ""slightly left of center"".<ref name=ucla-groseclose/> ""One thing people should keep in mind is that our data for the Drudge Report was based almost entirely on the articles that the Drudge Report lists on other Web sites"", said [[Timothy Groseclose , the head of the study. ""Very little was based on the stories that Matt Drudge himself wrote. The fact that the Drudge Report appears left of center is merely a reflection of the overall bias of the media.""<ref name=ucla-groseclose></ref> Professor [[Mark Liberman  critiqued the statistical model used in this study on the basis that model assumed conservative politicians do not care about the ideological position of think tanks they cite, while liberal politicians do.<ref name=""Language Log""></ref><ref name=""Language Log.""></ref> The study was also criticized by media watchdog Spinwatch for its methodology and its authors' ties to conservative think tanks.  In 2015 and 2016, Drudge repeatedly featured pro-Trump headlines during the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|Republican Party presidential primaries , leading [[Salon  website |Salon.com  and [[Politico  to describe Drudge as ""all in"" for Trump.<ref name=""politico.com""></ref>  ==Influence== According to Quantcast, the site has more than three million page visits per day.<ref name=""quantcast""></ref> According to [[Mark Halperin , ""Drudge's coverage affects the media's political coverage"", effectively steering the media's political coverage towards what Halperin calls ""the most salacious aspects of American politics"".<ref name=""abctone""/> In ''The Way To Win'', a book written by Halperin and [[John F. Harris|John Harris , Drudge is called ""the [[Walter Cronkite  of his era"".<ref name=""abctone""/><ref name=""waytowin""></ref> [[Democratic Party  United States |Democratic Party  strategist [[Chris Lehane  says ""phones start ringing"" whenever Drudge breaks a story, and [[Mark McKinnon , a former media advisor to [[George W. Bush , said that he checked the site 30–40 times per day.<ref name=""abctone""></ref>  Wallsten analyzed the data derived from a detailed content analysis of print, broadcast and blog discussions during the last five weeks of the 2008 campaign. Rather than the broad impact posited by professional political observers, Wallsten found that, even on issues where the site should be expected to have its largest impact, the stories highlighted on the Drudge Report exert a fairly inconsistent influence over what traditional media outlets chose to cover. Specifically, the time series analysis presented by Wallsten shows evidence of a ""Drudge effect"" on print and broadcast coverage for only five of the 10 political scandals that received the most attention on the Drudge Report between September 30 and November 3, 2008.   Matt Drudge has been criticized by other media news personalities: [[Bill O'Reilly  commentator |Bill O'Reilly  twice called Drudge a ""threat to democracy"" in response to Drudge disclosing his book sales figures,<ref name=""drudgeoreilly""></ref> and [[Keith Olbermann  referred to Drudge as ""an idiot with a modem"".<ref name=""wapopundit""></ref>  Drudge, along with his website, was labelled one of the ""Top 10 anti-Barack Obama conservatives"" by the US editor of [[The Daily Telegraph  in February 2009.  In addition to its media influence, the Drudge Report has influenced design elements on other sites, some with opposing viewpoints <ref name=""Drudgeretort""></ref> and some which use the same format for listing news.  A left-leaning parody site called [[Drudge Retort  was founded in 1998 as ""a send-up of Mr. Drudge's breathless style"".<ref name=""nyt-retort""></ref><ref name=""retort-author""></ref><ref name=""richtel""></ref> According to online analytics data for April 2010 from the Newspaper Marketing Agency, the Drudge Report is the number one site referrer for all online UK commercial newspaper websites.  ==Notable stories== ===Monica Lewinsky scandal=== The Drudge Report attained prominence when it was the first to report what came to be known as the [[Lewinsky scandal . It published the story on January 17, 1998, alleging that ''[[Newsweek '' had turned down the story.  ===Swift Boat Veterans for Truth=== During the 2004 US presidential campaign, the [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth  group made claims about [[John Kerry 's war record, which were mentioned by Drudge and investigated by major newspapers and TV networks.<ref name=""abctone""/>  The book ''Unfit for Command: Swiftboat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry'' became a best-seller in part due to its promotion in the Drudge Report.  ===Obama photo=== Drudge published a photo of [[Barack Obama  in [[Somali people|Somali  tribal dress on February 25, 2008, and reported that the photo had been sent to him by a Clinton campaign staffer.  The publication of the photograph resulted in a brief war of words between the Clinton and Obama campaign organizations.  ===Prince Harry in Afghanistan=== On February 28. 2008, Drudge published an article noting that [[Prince Harry  was serving with his regiment in [[Afghanistan . Prince Harry was ten weeks into a front-line deployment in Afghanistan that was subject to a voluntary news blackout by the UK press. The blackout was designed to protect Prince Harry and the men serving with him from being specifically targeted by the [[Taliban . An [[Australia n weekly women's magazine ''[[New Idea '' had broken the story in January, but it was not followed up at the time. The ''New Idea'' editors claimed ignorance of any news blackout.<ref name=""New Idea pleads""></ref> Then a German newspaper ''[[Berliner Kurier '' published a short piece on February 28, also before Drudge.<ref name=""nonexlusive""></ref>  Drudge subsequently claimed the report as an exclusive. [[Chief of the General Staff  United Kingdom |Chief of the General Staff  [[Richard Dannatt, Baron Dannatt|Sir Richard Dannatt , professional head of the British Army, said: ""I am very disappointed that foreign websites have decided to run this story without consulting us"".<ref name=""Dannatt""></ref> The Prince's tour of duty was prematurely ended, since his unit might have been targeted by large-scale [[suicide attacks  intended to kill the Prince.  ===US Senate problems=== On March 9, 2010, The [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States Senate|Senate Sergeant-at-Arms  claimed that the site was ""responsible for the many viruses popping up throughout the Senate...Please avoid using [this] site until the Senate resolves this issue...The Senate has been swamped the last couples  days with this issue."" The Drudge Report countered stating that ""it served more than 29 million pages Monday without an e-mail complaint about 'pop ups,' or the site serving 'viruses'.""  ==Controversial stories, errors and questions about sourcing== ===Exclusives=== Research by the media magazine [[Brill's Content  in 1998 cast doubt on the accuracy of the majority of the ""exclusives"" claimed by the Drudge Report. Of the 51 stories claimed as exclusives from January to September 1998, the magazine found that 31  61%  were actually exclusive stories. Of those, 32% were untrue, 36% were true and the remaining 32% were of debatable accuracy.<ref name=""brillscontent"" />  ===Sidney Blumenthal lawsuit=== In 1997, the Drudge Report reported that incoming White House assistant [[Sidney Blumenthal  beat his wife and was covering it up. Drudge retracted the story the next day and apologized, saying that he was given bad information, but Blumenthal filed a $30 million libel lawsuit against Drudge. After four years Blumenthal dropped his lawsuit, saying that the suit had cost him tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees. He agreed to pay $2,500 to Drudge's Los Angeles attorney for travel costs, claiming that Drudge was ""backed by unlimited funds from political supporters who use a tax-exempt foundation"".<ref name=""waposettlement""></ref><ref name=""drudgequote""></ref><ref name=""wimpy""></ref> The Individual Rights Foundation, led by [[conservative  activist [[David Horowitz , paid Drudge's legal fees in the Blumenthal lawsuit.  A federal judge noted in the judgment that Drudge ""is not a reporter, a journalist, or a newsgatherer. He is, as he admits himself, simply a purveyor of gossip.""<ref name=""gossip""></ref>  ===Alleged John Kerry intern scandal=== During the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential campaign , Drudge ran a story quoting General [[Wesley Clark , in which Clark claimed that the [[John Kerry  campaign would implode over an intern affair. Drudge reported that other news outlets were investigating the alleged affair, but removed it from the site shortly afterwards when the other news outlets dropped their investigations.<ref name=""alexandrapolier""></ref>  ===Alleged Bill Clinton illegitimate child=== In 1999, the Drudge Report announced that it had viewed a videotape which was the basis of a ''[[Star Magazine '' and ''[[Hard Copy '' story.  Under the headline, ''Woman Names Bill Clinton Father Of Son In Shocking Video Confession'', Drudge reported a videotaped ""confession"" by a former prostitute who claimed that her son was fathered by [[Bill Clinton . The ''Report'' stated, ""To accuse the most powerful man in the world of being the father of her son is either the hoax of a lifetime, or a personal turmoil that needs resolution. Only two people may know that answer tonight."" The claim has not been proven true or false.  ===Alleged heckling of Republican Senators by CNN reporter=== On April 1, 2007, Drudge cited an unnamed ""official"" source saying that [[CNN  reporter [[Michael Ware  had ""heckled"" Republican Senators McCain and Graham during a live press conference.<ref name=""drudgeheckle""></ref> Drudge reported that:    A video hosted by [[Rawstory  shows that Ware did not make a sound or ask any question during the press conference.  ===''Oprah'' and Sarah Palin=== On September 5, 2008, the Drudge Report reported that ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah '' staffers were ""sharply divided on the merits of booking Sarah Palin"". Drudge said that he obtained the information from an anonymous source. Winfrey responded in a written statement to news outlets saying, ""The item in today's Drudge Report is categorically untrue. There has been absolutely no discussion about having Sarah Palin on my show. At the beginning of this presidential campaign when I decided that I was going to take my first public stance in support of a candidate, I made the decision not to use my show as a platform for any of the candidates."" Oprah Winfrey's public statement came after she had already endorsed Barack Obama for president on ''[[Larry King Live '' in 2007. Drudge was accused by some commentators of planting a false story for political ends.  ===Ashley Todd attack hoax=== On October 23, 2008, Drudge published an unconfirmed exclusive story regarding [[Ashley Todd , the 20-year-old employee<ref name=""storm"" /><ref name=""todd employee""></ref> of the [[College Republicans|College Republican National Committee  CRNC   and [[John McCain  volunteer who had allegedly been attacked by a black male for having a McCain sticker on her car in [[Pittsburgh . Drudge reported the story without a link but as ""developing"", titling the headline ""Shock: McCain Volunteer Attacked and Mutilated in Pittsburgh – ""B"" carved into 20 yr old Woman's Face"".<ref name=""HuffPo""></ref> The story set off a ""storm of media attention"",<ref name=""storm""></ref> being quickly picked up by many conservative bloggers and right-wing talk radio show hosts, all citing the Drudge Report as their source. It was also reported in newspapers and TV both in the US and around the world. The story was confirmed to be a hoax perpetrated by Todd and, according to [[Talking Points Memo , spread to reporters by McCain's Pennsylvania Communications Director.  Drudge then printed a retraction of the story, including links to the news stories detailing that the attack had been a hoax, and that Ashley Todd had performed a similar ""attack"" on herself while volunteering in a local [[Ron Paul  [[grassroots  group. She was later asked to leave the group because of the hoax.  ===Birther conspiracy theories=== Drudge Report promoted the debunked conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not a U.S. citizen.  ===Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign=== On August 8, 2016, Drudge Report used a photo of Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton  on their website.  The photo depicted two men helping Clinton go up the stairs during her campaign in [[South Carolina  on February 27, 2016. Afterwards, several [[Twitter  accounts in support of Republican nominee [[Donald Trump  used the photo on the site, especially with the hashtag #HillaryHealth, which was used prior to the incident.<ref name=""History""></ref> The use of the photo was criticized by several commentators for taking a relatively old photograph out of context as well as misleading their readers.<ref name=""Hillary Health""></ref>  On October 3, 2016, Drudge Report published an unfounded claim that [[Bill Clinton  had an illegitimate child named Danney Williams, an allegation that Drudge Report itself had reported as debunked in 1999 based on a ''[[Time  magazine |Time '' magazine article.  On December 30, 2016, Drudge Report accused the [[United States federal government  of attempting to shut down its website with a [[denial-of-service attack .<ref name=""btusgovattacksdrudge""></ref><ref name=""sacbeesuggests""></ref> Beginning roughly one week earlier, DDoS attacks had repeatedly taken the site offline for extended periods. Cybersecurity analysts speculated that the attack was on the scale of the [[2016 Dyn cyberattack  and suggested that only a small number of groups would have the ability to take down a highly-trafficked site for extended lengths of time.  Drudge Report promoted the debunked [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory , as well as conspiracy theories about the [[murder of Seth Rich .  === Conspiracy theories about the 2017 Las Vegas Massacre === In October 2017, Drudge Report promoted conspiracy theories about the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting|2017 Las Vegas Massacre .  === Immigration === In October 2017, the Drudge Report shared a false Breitbart News story claiming that an undocumented immigrant caused the [[October 2017 Northern California wildfires .<ref name="":0""></ref> The story was rebutted by the Sonoma County's sheriff department which stated, ""This is completely false, bad, wrong information that Breitbart started and is being put out into the public.""<ref name="":0"" />  In June 2018, the Drudge Report used a misleading headline and photo pairing to suggest that migrant children who had been separated from their parents by the Trump administration were violent criminals. The photo was of a group of Syrian children holding toy guns.  ==References==   ==External links==  *  <!-- November 5, 2016 test *  --> * Archives: **  **  **   [[Category:American news websites  [[Category:Clinton–Lewinsky scandal  [[Category:News aggregators  [[Category:American conservative websites  [[Category:Alternative media  [[Category:American political websites  [[Category:American political blogs  [[Category:Internet properties established in 1996  [[Category:1996 establishments in Florida ","The Drudge Report is a politically right-leaning  news aggregator website.

It was founded in 1919, and was the first U.S. daily printed in [[Tabloid  newspaper format |tabloid format . It reached its peak circulation in 1947, at 2.4 million copies a day.  ==History== [[File:Finest picture front page.jpg|thumb|left|upright|February 5, 1921 front page   The ''Daily News'' was founded by [[Joseph Medill Patterson  in 1919, as the '''''Illustrated Daily News'''''.  It was not connected to an earlier ''[[New York Daily News  19th century |New York Daily News '', which was founded in 1855, flourished under [[Benjamin Wood , and ceased publication in December 1906.  Patterson and his cousin, [[Robert R. McCormick  were co-publishers of the ''[[Chicago Tribune '' and grandsons of [[Tribune Company  founder Joseph Medill.<ref name=MedillBio>''Current Biography 1942'', pp. 648–51: ""Patterson, Joseph Medill""</ref>  When Patterson and McCormick could not agree on the editorial content of the Chicago paper, the two cousins decided at a meeting in Paris that Patterson would work on the project of launching a Tribune-owned newspaper in New York. On his way back, Patterson met with [[Alfred Harmsworth , who was the Viscount Northcliffe and publisher of the ''[[Daily Mirror '', London's tabloid newspaper. Impressed with the advantages of a tabloid, Patterson launched the ''Daily News'' on June 26, 1919.<ref name=MedillBio />  The ''Daily News'' was not an immediate success, and by August 1919, the paper's circulation had dropped to 26,625.<ref name=MedillBio /> Still, New York's many subway commuters found the tabloid format easier to handle, and readership steadily grew. By the time of the paper's first anniversary in June 1920, circulation was over 100,000 and by 1925, over a million. Circulation reached its peak in 1947, at 2.4 million daily and 4.7 million on Sunday.  The ''Daily News'' carried the slogan ""New York's Picture Newspaper"" from 1920 to 1991, for its emphasis on photographs, and a camera has been part of the newspaper's logo from day one. The paper's later slogan, developed from a 1985 ad campaign, is ""New York's Hometown Newspaper"", while another has been ""The Eyes, the Ears, the Honest Voice of New York"". The ''Daily News'' continues to include large and prominent [[photography|photographs , for news, entertainment and sports, as well as intense city news coverage, [[Gossip column|celebrity gossip , [[classified advertising|classified ads , [[comics , a [[sports  section, and an opinion section.  News-gathering operations were, for a time, organized using two-way radios operating on 173.3250&nbsp;MHz  radio station KEA 871 , allowing the assignment desk to communicate with its personnel who utilized a fleet of ""radio cars"".  Prominent sports [[cartoonist s have included [[Bill Gallo , [[Bruce Stark  and [[Ed Murawinski . Columnists have included [[Walter Kaner . Editorial cartoonists have included [[C. D. Batchelor .  The paper briefly published a Monday-Friday afternoon counterpart, ''Daily News Tonight'', between August 19, 1980 and August 28, 1981; this competed with the ''[[New York Post '', which had earlier launched a morning edition to complement its evening newspaper. Occasional ""P.M. Editions"" were published as extras in 1991, during the brief tenure of [[Robert Maxwell  as publisher.  In 1982, and again in the early 1990s during a newspaper strike, the ''Daily News'' almost went out of business. In the 1982 instance, the parent Tribune Company offered the tabloid up for sale. In 1991, millionaire Robert Maxwell offered financial assistance to the ''News'' to help it stay in business. When Maxwell died shortly thereafter, the ''News'' seceded from his publishing empire, which eventually splintered under questions about whether Maxwell had the financial backing to sustain it. After Maxwell's death in 1991, the paper was held together in bankruptcy by existing management, led by editor [[James Willse , who became interim publisher after buying the paper from Tribune. [[Mortimer Zuckerman|Mort Zuckerman  bought the paper in 1993.  From its founding until 1991, the ''Daily News'' was owned by the Tribune Company. In 1948, the ''News'' established [[WPIX   Channel 11 in New York City , whose call letters were based on the ''News''s nickname of ""New York's Picture Newspaper""; and later bought what became WPIX-FM, which is now known as [[WFAN-FM . The television station became a Tribune property outright in 1991, and remains in the former Daily News Building; the radio station was purchased by [[Emmis Communications , and since 2014 has been owned by [[CBS Radio  as an FM simulcast of [[WFAN  AM |its AM namesake .  The ''News'' also maintains local bureaux in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, at [[New York City Hall|City Hall , within [[One Police Plaza , and at the various state and federal courthouses in the city.  In January 2012, former ''[[News of the World '' and ''New York Post'' editor [[Colin Myler  was appointed editor-in-chief of the ''Daily News''. Myler was replaced by his deputy [[Jim Rich  in September 2015.  On September 4, 2017, [[tronc , the publishing operations of the former Tribune Company  which had spun out its publishing assets to separate them from its broadcast assets , announced that it had acquired the ''Daily News''. Tronc had bought the ''Daily News'' for $1, assuming ""operational and pension liabilities"". By the time of purchase, circulation had dropped to 200,000 on weekdays and 260,000 on Sundays. In July 2018, tronc fired half of the paper's editorial staff, including the editor-in-chief, Jim Rich. Rich was replaced by Robert York, Publisher and Editor-in-Chief of tronc-owned [[The Morning Call  in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The paper's social media staff were included in the cut; images and [[memes  that were later deleted were posted on its [[Twitter  feed.  ==Editorial stance and style== ''[[The New York Times|New York Times '' journalist Alan Feuer said the ''Daily News'' focuses heavily on ""deep sourcing and doorstep reporting"", providing city-centered ""crime reportage and hard-hitting coverage of public issues [...] rather than portraying New York through the partisan divide between liberals and conservatives"".<ref name=""FeuerLayoffs"" /> According to Feuer, the paper is known for ""speaking to and for the city’s working class"" and for ""its crusades against municipal misconduct"".<ref name=""FeuerLayoffs""></ref>  ''The New York Times'' has described the ''Daily News''s editorial stance as ""flexibly centrist""<ref name=""FeuerLayoffs"" /> with a ""high-minded, if populist, legacy"". The ''News'' endorsed Republican [[George W. Bush  in the 2004 presidential election,<ref name=""E&P""></ref> Democrat [[Barack Obama  in 2008, Republican [[Mitt Romney  in 2012, and Democrat [[Hillary Clinton  in 2016.  ==Headquarters== [[File:New York Daily News building 1930.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Daily News Building , [[John Mead Howells  and [[Raymond Hood , architects, rendering by [[Hugh Ferriss . The landmark building housed the paper until the mid-1990s.   From its founding, it was based at 23 Park Place, a block from [[New York City Hall|City Hall , and two blocks from [[Park Row  Manhattan |Park Row , the traditional home of the city's newspaper trade. The cramped conditions demanded a much larger space for the growing newspaper.  From 1929 to 1995, the ''Daily News'' was based in the landmark skyscraper at [[Daily News Building|220 East 42nd Street  near Second Avenue, designed by [[John Mead Howells  and [[Raymond Hood . The paper moved to 450 West 33rd Street in 1995, but the 42nd Street location is still known as [[Daily News Building|The News Building  and still features a giant globe and weather instruments in its lobby.  It was the model for the ''[[Daily Planet '' building of the first two ''[[Superman in film|Superman '' films . The former ''News'' subsidiary WPIX-TV remains in the building.  The third headquarters of the ''Daily News'' at 450 West 33rd Street straddled the railroad tracks going into [[Pennsylvania Station  New York City |Pennsylvania Station . The building is now the world headquarters of the [[Associated Press .  In June 2011, the paper moved its operations to two floors at 4 New York Plaza in lower Manhattan. Sixteen months later, the structure was severely damaged and rendered uninhabitable by flooding from [[Hurricane Sandy . In the immediate aftermath, news operations were conducted remotely from several temporary locations, eventually moving to office space at the Jersey City printing plant. In early 2013, operations moved to rented space at 1290 Avenue of the Americas near [[Rockefeller Center —just four blocks north of its rival ''[[New York Post .'' The staff returned to the permanent 4 New York Plaza location in early November 2013.  ==Printing facilities== In 1993, the ''Daily News'' consolidated its printing facilities near [[Liberty State Park  in [[Jersey City, New Jersey .  In 2009, the paper spent $150 million on printing presses as part of its move to full color.  In 2011, the company spent $100 million to buy three new presses, using a $41.7 million Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit from the [[New Jersey|State of New Jersey .  ==Pulitzer Prizes== The ''Daily News'' has won eleven [[Pulitzer Prize s over its history.  In [[1998 Pulitzer Prize|1998 , ''Daily News'' columnist [[Mike McAlary  won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Commentary  for his multi-part series of columns  published in 1997  on [[Abner Louima , who was sodomized and tortured by [[New York City Police Department|New York City police officers .  In [[2007 Pulitzer Prize|2007 , the ''News'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing  for a series of thirteen editorials, published over five months, that detailed how more than 12,000 rescue workers who responded after the [[September 11 attacks  and become [[Health effects arising from the September 11 attacks|ill from toxins in the air .<ref name=""Saltonstall""></ref> The Pulitzer citation said that the award was given to the paper ""for its compassionate and compelling editorials on behalf of [[Ground Zero  workers, whose health problems were neglected by the city and the nation.""<ref name=""Saltonstall"" />  In 2017, the ''Daily News'' was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service  in collaboration with non-profit [[ProPublica  ""for uncovering, primarily through the work of reporter [[Sarah Ryley , widespread abuse of eviction rules by the police to oust hundreds of people, most of them poor minorities.""  ==Noteworthy front pages== In 1928, a ''News'' reporter strapped a small camera to his leg, and shot a photo of [[Ruth Snyder  being executed in the [[electric chair .<ref name=""siedu""></ref> The next day's newspaper carried the headline ""DEAD!"".  [[File:Ford to City.PNG|thumb|upright|October 30, 1975, front page   On October 29, 1975, [[President Gerald Ford  gave a speech denying federal assistance to spare New York City from bankruptcy. The front page of the October 30, 1975 Daily News read: “FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD.” Ford later said the headline had played a role in his losing the 1976 presidential election.<ref name=""cutinhalf""></ref>  In the year leading up to the [[U.S. presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election , the paper's headlines became more provocative, helping to rejuvenate it and, with more opinionated editorials with the aforementioned headlines, once again demonstrate its place in the city's media.  Following the [[2015 San Bernardino attack|2015 San Bernardino shooting , in which 14 people were killed, the paper's front page displayed ""GOD ISN'T FIXING THIS"" along with tweets from [[Republican Party  United States |Republican  politicians offering [[thoughts and prayers .<ref name=""Provocative"">Chris Cillizza, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/02/the-new-york-daily-newss-very-provocative-front-page-on-the-san-bernardino-shooting/ The New York Daily News’s very provocative front page on the San Bernardino shooting], Washington Post''  December 2, 2015 .</ref> The paper advocated for [[Gun politics in the United States|tighter gun laws , condemning what it described as ""empty platitudes and angry rhetoric"" rather than action ""in response to the ongoing plague of gun violence in our country.""<ref name=""Provocative"" /><ref name=""Durando"">Jessica Durando, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/12/03/ny-daily-news-provokes-cover-calif-shooting-god-isnt-fixing/76703060/ Daily News' provokes with cover on Calif. shooting: 'God isn't fixing this'], ''USA Today''  December 3, 2015 .</ref> The provocative headline<ref name=""Provocative"" /><ref name=""Durando"" /> received both praise and criticism.  On January 2016, after Republican senator and presidential candidate [[Ted Cruz  of [[Texas  disparaged ""New York values"" in a Republican primary debate, the ''News'' responded with a cover page headline reading ""DROP DEAD, TED"" and showing the [[Statue of Liberty  giving the [[The finger|middle finger .  ==Controversies== The ''Daily News'' supported the [[Iraq War . On March 14, 2003, six days before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq , the ''Daily News'' reported ""President Bush is targeting an aggressive, dangerous, psychotic dictator who has stockpiled weapons of mass destruction and would use them without compunction. ... With Saddam in power, there can be no peace. One argument you hear raised against war is fear of retaliation: America mustn't upset the terrorists. After 9/11, does this even need to be rebutted? Terrorists have killed thousands of Americans already and thirst for more. Fighting back is a necessity, unless people want the peace of the grave.""  On December 20, 2016, ''Daily News'' columnist [[Gersh Kuntzman  compared the assassination of the Russian Ambassador to Turkey, [[Andrei Karlov , to the assassination of Nazi German diplomat [[Ernst vom Rath  by Jewish student [[Herschel Grynszpan , saying ""justice has been served.""

In the 21st century ''The Forward'' is a digital publication with online reporting. In 2016, the publication of the Yiddish version changed its print format from a bi-weekly newspaper to a monthly magazine; the English weekly newspaper followed that way in 2017. Those magazines were published until 2019.<ref name=cease/>  ''The Forward'''s perspective on world and national news and its reporting on the Jewish perspective on modern United States have made it one of the most influential American Jewish publications. ''The Forward'' is published by an independent [[not-for-profit  association. It has a politically [[Progressivism|progressive  editorial focus.    The Yiddish Forward  ''Forverts''  is a clearinghouse for the latest developments in the Yiddish world with almost daily news reports related to Yiddish language and culture as well as videos of cooking demonstrations, Yiddish humor and new songs. A Yiddish rendition of the [[Leonard Cohen  song “[[Hallelujah  Leonard Cohen song |Hallelujah ”, translated and performed by klezmer musician Daniel Kahn, garnered over a million views.

These two founding fathers of ''The Forward'' were quick to enlist in the ranks of a new rival socialist political party founded in 1897, the [[Social Democratic Party of America , founded by the nationally famous leader of the 1894 [[American Railway Union  strike, [[Eugene V. Debs , and [[Victor L. Berger , a German-speaking teacher and newspaper publisher from [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee . Both joined the SDP in July 1897.  Despite this political similarity, Miller and Cahan differed as to the political orientation of the paper and Cahan left after just four months to join the staff of ''The Commercial Advertiser,'' a well-established [[Republican Party  United States |Republican  newspaper also based in New York City.  For the next four years Cahan remained outside of ''The Forward'' office, learning the newspaper trade in a financially successful setting. He only returned, he later recalled in his memoirs, upon the promise of ""absolute full power"" over the editorial desk.  The circulation of the paper grew quickly, paralleling the rapid growth of the Yiddish speaking population of the United States.

The paper was a significant participant in the activities of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union ; [[Benjamin Schlesinger , a former president of the ILGWU, became the general manager of the paper in 1923, then returned to the presidency of the union in 1928.

The decision to launch a Russian Forward in the crowded market of Russian-language journalism in New York followed approaches to the Forward Association by a number of intellectual leaders in the fast-growing émigré community who expressed an interest in adding a voice that was strongly Jewish, yet with a secular, social-democratic orientation and an appreciation for the cultural dimension of Jewish life.""

The company has been owned by [[Voice Media Group  since January 2013, when a group of senior executives bought out the founding owners. Stuart Warner was named editor of ''New Times'' in January 2017.   == Founding ==  The paper was founded in 1970 by a group of students at [[Arizona State University , led by Frank Fiore, Karen Lofgren, Michael Lacey, Bruce Stasium, Nick Stupey, Gayle Pyfrom, Hal Smith, and later, Jim Larkin, as a [[counterculture  response to the [[Kent State shootings  in the spring of that year. Gary Brennan played a role in its creation. According to the 20th Anniversary issue of the ''New Times'', published on May 2, 1990, Fiore suggested that the anti-war crowd put out its own paper. The first summer issues were called the ''Arizona Times'' and assembled in the staff's La Crescenta apartments across from ASU. The ''Arizona Times'' was renamed the ''New Times'' as the first college issue went to press in September 1970.  == Arrest controversy ==  In October 2007, [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County  sheriff's deputies arrested Lacey and Larkin on charges of revealing secret [[grand jury  information concerning the investigations of the ''New Times''s long-running feud with Maricopa County [[sheriff  [[Joe Arpaio . In July 2004, the ''New Times'' published Arpaio's home address in the context of a story about his real estate dealings, which the County Attorney's office was investigating as a possible crime under Arizona state law. A special prosecutor served Village Voice Media with a subpoena ordering it to produce ""all documents"" related to the original real estate article, as well as ""all Internet web site traffic information"" to a number of articles that mentioned Arpaio. The prosecutor further ordered Village Voice Media to produce the [[IP address es of all visitors to the ''Phoenix New Times'' website since January 1, 2004, as well as which websites those readers had been to prior to visiting. As an act of ""[[civil disobedience "", Lacey and Larkin published the contents of the subpoena on or about October 18, which resulted in their arrests the same day. On the following day, the county attorney dropped the case after declining to pursue charges against the two.  The special prosecutor's subpoena included a demand for the names of all people who had read the Arpaio story on the newspaper's website. It was the revealing of the subpoena information by the ''New Times'' which led to the arrests.  [[Maricopa County  Attorney [[Andrew Thomas  prosecutor |Andrew Thomas  dropped the charges less than 24 hours after the two were arrested.  In the weeks following the arrests, members of the [[Association of Alternative Newsweeklies , of which the ''Phoenix New Times'' is a member, provided links on their websites to places where Arpaio's address could be found.  This was done to show solidarity with the ''Phoenix New Times''.  In February 2008, the paper filed a formal notice of claim, which is required by Arizona law before suing government officials.  In December 2013, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors agreed to pay ''Phoenix New Times'' founders Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin $3.75 million to settle their false arrest lawsuit against the county defendants.  == References ==   == External links ==  * [http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/ ''Phoenix New Times'' official site] * [https://web.archive.org/web/20120808020845/http://www.villagevoicemedia.com/citypapers/phoenixnewtimes Village Voice Media's subsidiary profile of the ''Phoenix New Times'']    [[Category:Publications established in 1970  [[Category:Media in Phoenix, Arizona  [[Category:Newspapers published in Arizona  [[Category:Alternative weekly newspapers published in the United States  [[Category:1970 establishments in Arizona ","Phoenix New Times is a free digital and print media company based in Phoenix, Arizona.

The editors are [[Mark Frauenfelder , [[Cory Doctorow , [[David Pescovitz , [[Xeni Jardin  and [[Rob Beschizza ,<ref name=""editors""></ref> and the publisher is Jason Weisberger.   One report named ''Boing Boing'' as the most popular blog in the world until 2006, when Chinese-language blogs became popular, and it remained among the most widely-linked and cited blogs into the 2010s.  ==History== ''Boing Boing''  originally '''''bOING bOING'''''  started as a [[zine  in 1988 by married duo Mark Frauenfelder and [[Carla Sinclair .<ref name=""fastcompany""></ref> Issues were subtitled ''""The World's Greatest Neurozine""''. Associate editors included [[Gareth Branwyn , [[Jon Lebkowsky , [[Paco Nathan , and Pescovitz. Along with ''[[Mondo 2000 '', ''Boing Boing'' was an influence in the development of the [[cyberpunk  [[subculture . It reached a maximum circulation of 17,500 copies.<ref name=fastcompany/> The last issue of the zine was #15.

He relaunched ''Boing Boing'' as a [[weblog  on 21 January 2000, describing it as a ""directory of wonderful things"".<ref name=fastcompany/> Over time, Frauenfelder was joined by four co-editors: Doctorow, Pescovitz, Jardin and Beschizza, all of whom previously contributed to [[Wired Magazine|''Wired'' magazine . [[Maggie Koerth-Baker , after a run as a guest blogger in 2009,<ref name=""scienceditor""></ref> joined the site as its Science Editor, leaving to join a Nieman Foundation fellowship in 2014.  In September 2003, ''Boing Boing'' removed their Quicktopics user-comment feature without warning or explanation. Bloggers commenting on the change at the time speculated that it stemmed from ""identity impersonators and idiot flamers"" pretending to be co-editors.<ref name=""discussionGroupsOrNot""></ref> Xeni Jardin was a guest on the ''[[NewsHour with Jim Lehrer '' to discuss the ''[[Washington Post '''s decision to remove its Comments section on its website, and she spoke from her experience at ''Boing Boing.''<ref name=""newsHour""></ref> In August 2007, ''Boing Boing'' staff launched a redesigned site, which included a restored comment facility, moderated by [[Teresa Nielsen Hayden . In 2013, Boing Boing switched from the proprietary Disqus comment system to [[Discourse  software |Discourse , an open-source internet forum developed by [[Jeff Atwood , Robin Ward and Sam Saffron.<ref name=""forums""></ref>  In 2004, the project incorporated as Happy Mutants LLC, and [[John Battelle  became the blog's business manager.<ref name=""techCrunchProfile""></ref><ref name=""p2p""></ref> Boing Boing, by the mid-2000s, ""had become one of the most-read and linked-to blogs in the world"" according to ''[[Fast Company  magazine |Fast Company .''<ref name=fastcompany/>  The site added advertising over the course of late 2004, placed above and to the left and right of material, and, in 2005, in the site's [[RSS  file format |RSS  feed as well. Editor Cory Doctorow noted that ""John [Battelle] said it's going to be harder to make a little money to pay your bandwidth bills than it will be to make a lot of money and have a real source of income from this.""<ref name=""AdAge""></ref> The advertising income during the first quarter was already $27,000, and , ''Boing Boing'' still ""makes a nice living for its founders and a handful of contract employees,"" but it is no longer a member of Battelle's blog network Federated Media Publishing, Inc.<ref name=fastcompany/>  ''Boing Boing'' featured a ""guest blogger"" sidebar, then stopped the series in summer of 2004. In 2008, the ""guest blogger"" series was resumed, with guests posting in the main blog for two-week periods. Guests have included [[Charles Platt  author |Charles Platt , [[John Shirley , [[Mark Dery , [[Tiffany Lee Brown , Karen Marcelo of [[Survival Research Laboratories , [[Johannes Grenzfurthner  of [[monochrom , [[Rudy Rucker , [[Gareth Branwyn , [[Wiley Wiggins , [[Jason Scott  BBSes |Jason Scott  of [[textfiles.com , [[Jessamyn West  librarian |Jessamyn West  of [[librarian.net , journalists [[Danny O'Brien  journalist |Danny O'Brien  and [[Quinn Norton  and comedian [[John Hodgman .  In September 2006, ''Boing Boing'' introduced a weekly [[podcast , ""Boing Boing Boing"", intended to cover the week's posts and upcoming projects. The show's cast consists of the ''Boing Boing'' editors, accompanied by a weekly guest. In the same month, ''Boing Boing'' introduced a second podcast called ""Get Illuminated"", which features interviews with writers, artists, and other creatives.  The site's own original content is licensed under a [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial license , as of August 2008.  In September 2009, ''Boing Boing'' refused to comply with a demand from [[Polo Ralph Lauren 's lawyers to remove a post concerning a heavily manipulated image of model [[Filippa Hamilton , originally published by the Photoshop Disasters blog. The latter was forced to comply with the company's demand by its hosting provider.<ref name=""ralphLaurenUncannyValley""></ref> Ralph Lauren issued [[DMCA  takedown notices to ''BoingBoing''<nowiki>'s</nowiki>  ISP and [[Blogspot , which hosts Photoshop Disasters, claiming their use of the image infringed copyright. Blogspot complied, but ''Boing Boing''<nowiki>'s</nowiki>  ISP consulted with ''Boing Boing'' and agreed that the image was [[fair use . As a result, ''Boing Boing'' issued a mocking rebuttal,<ref name=""criticismRalphLauren""></ref> using the same image again and posting the takedown notice.  The rebuttal was widely reported, including on frequently viewed websites such as ''[[The Huffington Post ''<ref name=""ralphLaurenApologizes""></ref> and ''[[ABC News ''.<ref name=""photoEditingFlubs""></ref>  On the evening of 27 October 2010,<ref name=""boingBoingHack""></ref> a hacker attacked the ''Boing Boing'' website. About one hour later, it was down, but then returned.  On 3 May 2011, the first podcast of ""Gweek"" was released. ''Gweek'' is a podcast in which the editors and friends of ''Boing Boing'' talk about comic books, science fiction and fantasy, video games, TV shows, music, movies, tools, gadgets, apps, and other ""neat"" stuff. In the first episode of ''Gweek'', Rob Beschizza and Mark Frauenfelder discussed subjects such as the video game ''[[Portal 2 '', graphic novels, upcoming science fiction books, and recommendations of some of their favorite adventure games for mobile platforms. ''Boing Boing'' has since added several other podcasts.<ref name=""podcasts""></ref>  In late 2017 or early 2018, the site was sued by ''[[Playboy '', which alleged that a hyperlink to copyright-infringing content at [[Imgur  and [[YouTube  was itself illegal.  ==Unicorn chaser== A ""unicorn chaser"" is a concept created by ''Boing Boing'' editors as an [[antidote  to blog postings linking to sites containing disgusting or [[shock site|shocking images . The shocking post would be immediately followed by another post containing a picture of a [[unicorn . Xeni Jardin posted the first one  titled ""And now, we pause for a Unicorn Moment.""  in August 2003 as a reply to a picture of a rash posted by editor Mark Frauenfelder in an attempt to get readers to diagnose it for him.  It has also been used as an antidote for posts containing photos of a [[brain tumor , a man who pumped up the skin of his face with [[saline solution , many different ways to clean one's [[earwax , and a lengthy discussion of the Internet video ""[[2 Girls 1 Cup "".  On 18 May 2007, ''Boing Boing'' announced that [[Virgin America , as part of its ""Name Our Planes!"" campaign, would be naming one of its new aircraft ""Unicorn Chaser,"" after having asked ''Boing Boing'' to suggest a name.<ref name=""virgin""></ref>  ==Boing Boing Gadgets and Offworld== In August 2007, ''Boing Boing'' introduced a gadgets-focused companion site headed by former ''[[Gizmodo '' editor Joel Johnson. Johnson left in July 2009, to be replaced by Rob Beschizza,<ref name=""farewellJoel""></ref> formerly of ''Wired News''. Other writers include Steven Leckart and Lisa Katayama.<ref name=""welcomeKatayamaLeckart""></ref> Offworld, a blog covering video games edited by [[Brandon Boyer , was added in November 2008. These sites were incorporated into Boing Boing itself around 2010. Plans to revive the Offworld site were announced in 2015, with [[Leigh Alexander  journalist |Leigh Alexander  as Editor-in-Chief and Laura Hudson as Editor. Leigh Alexander and Laura Hudson left Offworld in early 2016 after publishing a collection of selected articles, successfully crowdfunded on Kickstarter in March 2016.  ==Boing Boing TV== In October 2007, ''Boing Boing'' started a new component, ''Boing Boing TV'', that consists of video segments including ''[[SPAMasterpiece Theater ''  [[2008 in television|2008   with [[John Hodgman , produced by its co-editors in conjunction with DECA, the ''Digital Entertainment Corporation of America''. Art tech group [[monochrom  was a frequent contributor. They created their sock puppet series ''Kiki and Bubu'' for ''Boing Boing TV''.<br>The episodes appear online, as well as on Virgin America flights.<ref name=""bbTVonVirgin""></ref>  ==Censorship== ''Boing Boing'' has been described as an ""outspoken critic of censorship elsewhere"",<ref name=""bbFendsOffCharges""></ref> and operates a high speed, high quality [[Tor  anonymity network |Tor  exit node, yet it has been accused of practicing forms of censorship itself. For example, the act of ""[[disemvoweling "" was popularized by the site—literally stripping out the vowels of any comment a moderator had taken exception to.   ===Violet Blue controversy=== Sex blogger [[Violet Blue  has been mentioned, interviewed and once contributed at ''Boing Boing''. On 23 June 2008, Blue posted on her blog, ''Tiny Nibbles'', that all posts related to her had been deleted from ''Boing Boing'', without explanation. The ''[[Los Angeles Times '' featured an interview that cast the silence on the part of ''Boing Boing'' on the matter as ""inexplicable"", causing a controversy as ''Boing Boing'' ""has often presented itself as a stalwart of cultural openness"". A heated debate ensued after a brief statement on the ''Boing Boing'' site regarding this action stated: ""Violet behaved in a way that made us reconsider whether we wanted to lend her any credibility or associate with her. It's our blog and so we made an editorial decision, like we do every single day"". In commentary attached to that blog entry, ""many commenters surmised that they had something to do with Blue's suing to stop a [[Noname Jane|porn star  from also using the name Violet Blue,"" and many commenters found the removal troubling, but Xeni Jardin said that she hoped she would not have to make the reasons public.  ==Notes and references==   ==External links== * [https://boingboing.net/ Boing Boing website] * [http://gadgets.boingboing.net/  Boing Boing Gadgets ] * [http://tv.boingboing.net/ Boing Boing TV] * [http://www.violetbluevioletblue.net/ A collection of deleted posts mentioning Violet Blue]  ;Audio/Video media *[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3tskqA9qc Boing Boing: The Making of a Media Empire] on ''BNETvideo'', official [[YouTube  channel of [[BNET .  19 December 2007     [[Category:Non-fiction Cyberpunk media  [[Category:Magazines established in 1988  [[Category:Internet properties established in 1995  [[Category:Blogs  [[Category:Defunct magazines of the United States  [[Category:American blogs  [[Category:Magazines disestablished in 1995 ","Boing Boing is a website, first established as a zine in 1988, later becoming a group blog.

Hamilton chose [[William Coleman  editor |William Coleman  as his first editor.<ref name=Emery_opcit/> [[File:William Cullen Bryant.jpg|thumb|120px|[[William Cullen Bryant , the ''Post''s most famous 19th-century editor  The most famous 19th-century ''Evening Post'' editor was the poet and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist  [[William Cullen Bryant . So well respected was the ''Evening Post'' under Bryant's editorship, it received praise from the English philosopher [[John Stuart Mill , in 1864.  In the summer of 1829, Bryant invited [[William Leggett  writer |William Leggett , the [[Locofoco  Democrat, to write for the paper. There, in addition to literary and drama reviews, Leggett began to write political editorials. Leggett's [[traditional liberalism|classical liberal  philosophy entailed a fierce opposition to [[central banking , a support for voluntary labor unions, and a dedication to [[laissez-faire  economics. He was a member of the [[Equal Rights Party  United States |Equal Rights Party . Leggett became a co-owner and editor at the ''Post'' in 1831, eventually working as sole editor of the newspaper while Bryant traveled in Europe in 1834 through 1835.  Another co-owner of the paper was [[John Bigelow . Born in Malden-on-Hudson, New York, John Bigelow, Sr. graduated in 1835 from Union College, where he was a member of the [[Sigma Phi  Society and the Philomathean Society, and was admitted to the bar in 1838. From 1849 to 1861, he was one of the editors and co-owners of the ''Evening Post''.  In 1881 [[Henry Villard  took control of the ''Evening Post'', as well as ''[[The Nation '', which became the ''Post''s weekly edition. With this acquisition, the paper was managed by the triumvirate of [[Carl Schurz , [[Horace White  writer |Horace White , and [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin|Edwin L. Godkin . When Schurz left the paper in 1883, Godkin became editor-in-chief. White became editor-in-chief in 1899, and remained in that role until his retirement in 1903.  In 1897, both publications passed to the management of Villard's son, [[Oswald Garrison Villard , a founding member of both the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  and the [[American Civil Liberties Union .  ===1918 to 1976=== Villard sold the paper in 1918, after widespread allegations of pro-German sympathies during [[World War I  hurt its circulation. The new owner was [[Thomas W. Lamont|Thomas Lamont , a senior partner in the [[Wall Street  firm of [[J.P. Morgan & Co. . Unable to stem the paper's financial losses, he sold it to a [[consortium  of 34 financial and reform political leaders, headed by [[Edwin Francis Gay , dean of the [[Harvard Business School , whose members included [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt . [[conservatism|Conservative  [[Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis|Cyrus H. K. Curtis —publisher of the ''[[Ladies Home Journal ''—purchased the ''Evening Post'' in 1924<ref name=ketupa></ref> and briefly turned it into a non-sensational [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid  in 1933.<ref name=ketupa/>  In 1934, [[J. David Stern  purchased the paper, changed its name to the ''New York Post'',<ref name=ketupa/> and restored its broadsheet size and liberal perspective.  In 1939, [[Dorothy Schiff  purchased the paper. Her husband, George Backer, was named editor and publisher. Her second editor  and third husband  [[Ted Thackrey  became co-publisher and co-editor with Schiff in 1942. Together, they recast the newspaper into its current tabloid format. In 1948 ''[[The Bronx Home News '' merged with it. In 1949, [[James Wechsler  became editor of the paper, running both the news and the editorial pages. In 1961, he turned over the news section to [[Paul Sann  and remained as editorial-page editor until 1980.  Under Schiff's tenure the ''Post'' was devoted to liberalism, supporting trade unions and social welfare, and featured some of the most-popular columnists of the time, such as [[Joseph Cookman , [[Drew Pearson  journalist |Drew Pearson , [[Eleanor Roosevelt , [[Max Lerner , [[Murray Kempton , [[Pete Hamill , and [[Eric Sevareid , in addition to theatre critic [[Richard Watts, Jr.  and [[gossip  [[columnist  [[Earl Wilson  columnist |Earl Wilson .  ===Murdoch ownership=== In November 1976, it was announced that [[Rupert Murdoch  had bought the ''Post'' from Schiff with the intention she would remain as a consultant for five years. It later emerged that Murdoch bought the newspaper for US$30.5 million.<ref name=""hollywoodreporter2005""/> The ''Post'' at this point was the only surviving afternoon daily in New York City and its circulation under Schiff had grown by two-thirds, particularly after the failure of the competing ''[[New York World Journal Tribune|World Journal Tribune ''. However, the rising cost of operating an afternoon daily in a city with worsening daytime traffic congestion, combined with mounting competition from expanded local radio and TV news cut into the ''Post''s profitability, though it made money from 1949 until Schiff's final year of ownership, when it lost $500,000. The paper has lost money ever since.<ref name=Emery_opcit/>  In late October 1995, the ''Post'' announced plans to change its Monday through Saturday publication schedule and begin issuing a Sunday edition, which it last published briefly in 1989. On April 14, 1996, the ''Post'' delivered its new Sunday edition at the cost of 50 cents per paper by keeping its size to 120 pages.<ref name=""Orlando""></ref> The amount, significantly less than Sunday editions from ''The Daily News'' and ''The New York Times'', was part of ''Post''s efforts ""to find a niche in the nation's most competitive newspaper market"".<ref name=""Orlando""/>  In December 2012, Murdoch announced that Jesse Angelo had been appointed publisher.  ==== Style====  [[File:NYPost.jpg|thumb|right|One of the paper's most famous headlines, from the edition of April 15, 1983   Murdoch imported the tabloid journalism style of many of his Australian and British newspapers, such as ''[[The Sun  United Kingdom |The Sun '', which remains the highest selling daily newspaper in the UK. This style was typified by the ''Post''s famous headlines such as ""Headless body in topless bar""  shown on the right, written by [[Vincent Musetto  . In its 35th-anniversary edition, ''[[New York  magazine |New York '' magazine listed this as one of the greatest headlines. It also has five other ''Post'' headlines in its ""Greatest Tabloid Headlines"" list.  Because of the institution of federal regulations limiting media [[cross ownership|cross-ownership  after Murdoch's purchase of WNEW-TV  now [[WNYW   and four other stations from [[Metromedia  to launch the [[Fox Broadcasting Company , Murdoch was forced to sell the paper for $37.6 million in 1988 to [[Peter S. Kalikow , a real-estate magnate with no news experience.<ref name=MomentTruth></ref> In 1988, the ''Post'' hired [[Jane Amsterdam , founding editor of ''[[Manhattan, inc. '', as its first female editor, and within six months the paper had toned down the sensationalist headlines.<ref name=""Tasteful Post""></ref> Within a year, Amsterdam was forced out by Kalikow, who reportedly told her ""credible doesn't sell ... Your big scoops are great, but they don't sell more papers.""   When Kalikow declared bankruptcy in 1993,<ref name=MomentTruth/> the paper was temporarily managed by [[Steven Hoffenberg ,<ref name=MomentTruth/> a financier who later pleaded guilty to [[security  finance |securities  [[fraud ; and, for two weeks, by [[Abraham Hirschfeld|Abe Hirschfeld , who made his fortune building parking garages. After a staff revolt against the Hoffenberg-Hirschfeld partnership—which included publication of an issue whose front page featured the iconic masthead picture of founder Alexander Hamilton with a single tear drop running down his cheek—the ''Post'' was again purchased in 1993 by Murdoch's News Corporation. This came about after numerous political officials, including Democratic governor of New York [[Mario Cuomo , persuaded the [[Federal Communications Commission  to grant Murdoch a permanent waiver from the cross-ownership rules that had forced him to sell the paper five years earlier. Without that FCC ruling, the paper would have shut down.  Various branches of Murdoch's media groups, [[21st Century Fox 's [[Endemol Shine North America  and [[News Corp ' New York Post created a ''Page Six TV'' nightly gossip show based and named after the Post's gossip section. A test run in July would occur on [[Fox Television Stations . The show garnered the highest ratings of a nationally syndicated entertainment newsmagazine in a decade when it debuted in 2017. With ''Page Six TV'''s success, the New York Post formed New York Post Entertainment, a scripted and unscripted television entertainment division, in July 2018 with Troy Searer as president.  ====Criticism====  The ''Post'' has been criticized since the beginning of Murdoch's ownership for [[sensationalism , blatant [[advocacy , and conservative [[Media bias|bias . In 1980, the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review '' stated ""''New York Post'' is no longer merely a journalistic problem. It is a social problem – a force for evil.""<ref name=""CJR"">''[[Columbia Journalism Review '', volume 18, number 5  Jan/Feb 1980 , p. 22–23.</ref>  Perhaps the most serious allegation against the ''Post'' is that it is willing to contort its news coverage to suit Murdoch's business needs, in particular that the paper has avoided reporting anything that is unflattering to the government of the People's Republic of China, where Murdoch has invested heavily in satellite television.<ref name=PageSix></ref>  Critics say that the ''Post'' allows its editorial positions to shape its story selection and news coverage. Former ''Post'' executive editor [[Steven D. Cuozzo  has responded that the ''Post'' ""broke the elitist media stranglehold on the national agenda.""  According to a survey conducted by [[Pace University  in 2004, the ''Post'' was rated the least-credible major news outlet in New York, and the only news outlet to receive more responses calling it ""not credible"" than credible  44% not credible to 39% credible .  The [[Public Enemy  band |Public Enemy  song ""[[A Letter to the New York Post|A Letter to the ''New York Post'' "" from their album ''[[Apocalypse '91...The Enemy Strikes Black '' is a complaint about what they believed to be negative and inaccurate coverage blacks received from the paper.  The ''Post''s coverage of the murder of [[Hasidic  landlord Menachem Stark prompted outrage from Jewish communal leaders and public figures.  ====Controversies====    There have been numerous controversies surrounding the ''Post'':  * In 1997, a national news story concerning [[Rebecca Sealfon 's victory in the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee  circulated. Sealfon was sponsored by the ''[[Daily News  New York |Daily News '', a direct in-market competitor.  ''Post'' published a picture of her but altered the photograph to remove the name of the ''Daily News'' as printed on a placard she was wearing. * On November 8, 2000, ''Post'' printed ""BUSH WINS!"" in a huge headline, although the presidential [[2000 U.S. Presidential election|election  remained in doubt because of the [[Florida election recount|recount  issues in Florida. Like ''Post'', many other newspapers around the country published a similar headline after the four major TV networks called the election for [[George W. Bush .   * On March 10, 2004, ''Post'' re-ran, as a full-color page one photograph, a photograph that had already been run three days earlier in black and white on page 9, showing the 24-story [[suicide  plunge of a New York University student, who had since been identified as 19-year-old Diana Chien, daughter of a prominent Silicon Valley businessman. Among criticisms leveled at ''Post'' was their addition of a tightly cropped inset photograph of Chien, a former high-school track athlete, depicting her in mid-jump from an athletic meet, giving the false impression that it was taken during her fatal act, despite the fact that she had fallen face up. * On July 6, 2004, ''Post'' ran an article claiming to have learned exclusively that [[United States Senate|Senator  [[John Kerry , the [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party 's Presidential nominee-in-waiting, had selected former [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader  [[Dick Gephardt  to be the party's [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidential  nominee. The article, under the headline ""KERRY'S CHOICE"", ran without a [[byline . The next day, ''Post'' had to print a new story, ""KERRY'S REAL CHOICE"", reporting Kerry's actual selection of Senator [[John Edwards  of [[North Carolina  as his running mate. * On April 21, 2006, several [[Asian-American  advocacy groups protested the use of the headline ""Wok This Way"" for a ''Post'' article about Bush's meeting with the [[Hu Jintao , President of the People's Republic of China. * On September 29, 2006, ''Post'' editor [[Sarah Polonsky  was fired abruptly for [[corruption|accepting gifts .<ref name=twsNYPost></ref><ref name=twsObserver>Kat Stoeffel, 09/02/11, The Observer, [http://observer.com/2011/09/gatecrashers-subject-threw-gatecrasher-a-birthday-party-are-reporter-freebies-back/ Gatecrasher Subject Threw Gatecrasher a Birthday Party!

Hamilton|Lee Hamilton —in primate fur, under the headline ""[[Cheese-eating surrender monkeys|SURRENDER MONKEYS "", inspired by a once-used line from ''[[The Simpsons ''. In defense of the ""Surrender Monkeys"" headline, media contributor Simon Dumenco wrote an ''[[Ad Age '' article about his love for ''Post''. * On February 18, 2009, ''Post'' ran a cartoon by [[Sean Delonas  that depicted a white police officer saying to another white police officer who has just shot a [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee  on the street: ""They'll have to find someone else to write the next [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|stimulus bill ."" The cartoon dually referred to President Obama and to the recent rampage of [[Travis  chimpanzee |Travis , a former chimpanzee actor; it was criticized as being in bad taste, primarily by making a reference to the [[racist  stereotype of [[African-American s being portrayed as [[apes .<ref name=CNN021809c>Roland S. Martin, [http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/18/martin.cartoon/index.html Commentary: NY Post cartoon is racist and careless], CNN, February 18, 2009, Accessed February 19, 2009.</ref> Civil rights activist [[Al Sharpton  called the cartoon ""troubling at best given the historic racist attacks of African-Americans as being synonymous with monkeys.""  ''Post'' has defended itself by stating that the cartoon was deliberately misinterpreted by its critics. * On December 4, 2012, ''Post'' used a picture taken by a freelance photographer, R. Umar Abbasi, of a 58-year-old man identified as Ki Suk Han struggling to climb back up onto the platform of the [[49th Street  BMT Broadway Line |49th Street  station as a [[New York City Subway|subway  train approached. The caption on the front read, ""Pushed on the subway track, this man is about to die"" on top, and ""DOOMED"" in large, boldface print on the bottom. The image caused outrage among many, as its use was viewed as exploiting a tragedy for commercial gain., though Abbasi stated that since he was not strong enough to pull the man up, he had attempted to use the flash on his camera to alert the driver of the oncoming train. *Aspects of ''Post''s coverage of the 2013 [[Boston Marathon bombing  were criticized.  ''Post'' reported in several stories on the day of the attack that the death toll was 12, while most organizations reported two and then three fatalities. In addition, they reported that a [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi  national was being held as a suspect, but Boston Police denied this and said they had no suspects in custody. Additionally, the April 18 cover of ''Post'' featured a full-page photo of two young men the paper described as being sought by law enforcement in possible connection with the attack. CBS News reporter [[John Miller  journalist |John Miller  reported that the two men are not considered suspects by the FBI. The apparent insinuation by ''Post'' that they were suspects was denounced by media critics. In June 2013, the two men, Salaheddin Barhoum and Yassine Zaimi, sued ''Post'' for [[libel  over the story. In 2014, the suit was settled. * On January 5, 2014, following the abduction and murder of Brooklyn businessman [[Menachem Stark , The ''Post'' cover story featured a picture of the victim dressed in his traditional Hasidic garb accompanied by the headline asking ""Who didn't want him dead?"" That front page sparked outrage for its insinuation that the murder was justified vigilantism. On that same day, some New York City elected officials condemned ''Post''s cover story. In a press conference led by Brooklyn borough president [[Eric Adams  politician |Eric Adams , New York City Public Advocate [[Letitia James  declared, ""Today [''New York Post'' has] given license to murder!"" James then asked that ""every government official should refrain from advertising in the New York Post, every government official should withdraw any governmental notice from the New York Post, and everyone should condemn the New York Post.""  The ''Post'' and the ''Daily News'' often take potshots at each other's work and accuracy, particularly in their respective gossip-page items.  In certain editions of the February 14, 2007, newspaper, an article referring to then-Senator [[Hillary Clinton 's support base for her [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential run  referred to then-Senator [[Barack Obama  as ""[[Osama Bin Laden|Osama ""; the paper realized its error and corrected it for the later editions and the website. ''Post'' noted the error and apologized in the February 15, 2007, edition. Earlier, on January 20, 2007, ''Post'' received some criticism for running a potentially misleading headline, ""'Osama' Mud Flies at Obama"", for a story that discussed rumors that Obama had been raised as a [[Muslim  and concealed it.  ===Influence=== In 2017, the ''New York Post'' was reported to be the preferred newspaper of U.S. President [[Donald Trump ,<ref name=""haberman-2017""></ref> who maintains frequent contact with its owner, Rupert Murdoch.<ref name=""haberman-2017""/>  ==Operations== ===Website=== [[File:NYPost 133 plant gate jeh.jpg|thumb|Printing plant  In 1996, the ''New York Post'' launched an [[Internet  version of the paper. The original site included color photos and sections broken down into News, Sports, Editorial, Gossip, Entertainment and Business. It also had an archive for the past seven days. Since then, it has been redesigned a number of times, with the latest incarnation launched in September 2013.  The current website also features continually updated breaking news; opinion, entertainment, business, tech, media, fashion and sports content; photo and video galleries; original ''Post'' videos; and streaming video for live events.  In 2014, the ''Post'' launched the website Decider. Decider provides recommendation for streaming services.  ===Highlights=== The paper is well known for its [[sports  section, which has been praised for its comprehensiveness; it begins on the back page, and among other coverage, contains columns about sports in the media by [[Phil Mushnick .  ''New York Post'' is also well known for its [[gossip  columnist [[Cindy Adams .  ====Page Six==== <!-- This section is linked from [[Page Six , [[Page six , [[Page Six TV  and [[Page 6  disambiguation   -->  The gossip section ""'''Page Six'''"" was created by [[James Brady  columnist |James Brady  and currently edited by Emily Smith  although it no longer actually appears on page six of the tabloid . Columnist [[Richard Johnson  columnist |Richard Johnson  edited Page Six for 25 years. February 2006 saw the debut of ''Page Six Magazine'', distributed free inside the paper. In September 2007, it started to be distributed weekly in the Sunday edition of the paper. In January 2009, publication of ''Page Six Magazine'' was cut to four times a year. Daily web content is published at www.pagesix.com.  Beginning with the 2017–18 television season, a daily [[broadcast syndication|syndicated  series known as '''''Page Six TV''''' came to air, produced by [[20th Television , which is part of the [[21st Century Fox  side of Rupert Murdoch's holdings. The show is hosted by comedian [[John Fugelsang , with contributions from ''Page Six'' and ''Post'' writers  including Carlos Greer , along with regular panelists Elizabeth Wagmeister from ''[[Variety  magazine |Variety '' and [[Bevy Smith . In March 2018, Fugelsang left and Page Six TV announced it was looking for a new host. Later it was announced that Wagmeister, Greer and Smith would be retained as equal co-hosts.  ===Sales=== The daily circulation of ''Post'' decreased in the final years of the Schiff era from 700,000 in the late 1960s to approximately 418,000 by the time she sold the paper to Murdoch in 1976. Under Murdoch, ''Post'' launched a morning edition to compete directly with the rival tabloid ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News '' in 1978—prompting the ''Daily News'' to retaliate with a PM edition called ''Daily News Tonight''. But the PM edition suffered the same problems with worsening daytime traffic that the afternoon ''Post'' experienced and the ''Daily News'' ultimately folded ''Tonight'' in 1981. By that time, circulation of the all-day ''Post'' soared to a peak of 962,000, the bulk of the increase attributed to its morning edition  It set a single-day record of 1.1 million on August 11, 1977 with the news of the arrest the night before of [[David Berkowitz , the infamous ""Son of Sam"" serial killer who terrorized New York for much of that summer . But ''Post'' lost so much money that Murdoch decided to shut down ''Post''s PM edition in 1982, turning ''Post'' into a morning-only daily.  ''Post'' and the ''Daily News'' have been locked in a bitter circulation war ever since. A resurgence during the first decade of the 21st century saw ''Post'' circulation rise to 724,748 by April 2007,<ref name=circ/> achieved partly by lowering the price from 50 cents to 25 cents. In October 2006, ''Post'' for the first time surpassed the ''Daily News'' in circulation—only to see the ''Daily News'' overtake its rival a few months later. In 2010, the ''Post''s daily circulation was 525,004, just 10,000 behind the ''Daily News''. , the ''Post'' was the fourth-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation, while the ''Daily News'' was ranked eighth.  Yet ''Post'' has remained unprofitable since Murdoch first purchased it from Dorothy Schiff in 1976—and was on the brink of folding when Murdoch bought it back in 1993, with at least one media report in 2012 indicating that ''Post'' loses up to $70 million a year. One commentator has suggested that ''Post'' cannot become profitable as long as the competing ''Daily News'' survives, and that Murdoch may be trying to force the ''Daily News'' to fold or sell out.  ===Recent headquarters=== The 1906 [[Old New York Evening Post Building  is a designated landmark. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places  in 1977.<ref name=""nris""></ref> It occupied the building until 1926 when a new main office for the ''Post'' was established at 75 West Street in the [[New York Evening Post Building . The building remained in use by the ''Post'' until 1970, it was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places  in 2000.<ref name=""nris""/> In 1967, Schiff bought 210 South Street, the former headquarters of the ''[[New York Journal American '', which closed a year earlier. The building became an instantly recognizable symbol for the ''Post''. In 1995, owner Rupert Murdoch relocated ''Post''s news and business offices to the [[News Corporation  headquarters tower at 1211 [[Sixth Avenue  Manhattan |Avenue of the Americas   Sixth Avenue  in midtown Manhattan.  ''Post'' shares this building with [[Fox News Channel  and ''[[The Wall Street Journal '', both of which are also owned by Murdoch.  Both the ''Post'' and the New York City edition of the ''Journal'' are printed at a state-of-the-art printing plant in the borough of [[The Bronx .  ==Cultural references== Vincent Musetto's 1983 headline inspired [[Peter Koper  to write the 1995 American black comedy ''[[Headless Body in Topless Bar ''.  ''Post'' front-page headlines have been featured in such films as ''[[The Manchurian Candidate '', ''[[North by Northwest '', ''[[Working Girl '', ''[[Who Was That Lady? '', and ''[[Top Secret!

It is published in Mumbai by [[Indian Express Limited|Indian Express Group . In 1999, eight years after the group's founder [[Ramnath Goenka 's death in 1991, the group was split between the family members. The southern editions took the name ''[[The New Indian Express '', while the northern editions, based in [[Mumbai , retained the original ''Indian Express'' name, with ''""The""'' prefixed to the title.  ''The Indian Express'' is published at ten locations—[[Delhi , [[Jaipur , [[Mumbai , [[Nagpur , [[Pune , [[Kolkata , [[Vadodara , [[Chandigarh , [[Lucknow  and [[Ahmedabad , [[Tirupati   ==History of the Indian Express Group==  *In 1932, the ''Indian Express'' was started by an [[ayurveda|Ayurvedic  doctor, [[P. Varadarajulu Naidu , at [[Chennai , being published by his ""Tamil Nadu"" [[Publisher|press . Soon under financial difficulties, he sold the newspaper to [[S. Sadanand|Swaminathan Sadanand , the founder of ''[[The Free Press Journal '', a national [[news agency . *In 1933 ''The Indian Express'' opened its second office in [[Madurai , launching the [[Tamil language|Tamil  edition, ''[[Dina Mani|Dinamani ''.  Sadanand introduced several innovations and reduced the price of the newspaper. Faced with financial difficulties, he sold a part of his stake to Ramanath Goenka as [[convertible debenture s. *In 1935, when ''The Free Press Journal'' finally collapsed, and after a protracted court battle with Goenka, Sadanand lost ownership of ''Indian Express''.  ==Expansion==  Later Goenka bought the remaining 26% of the company held by Sadanand. The newspaper then came under Goenka's sole control, taking the already anti-establishment tone of the paper to greater heights. Also at that time, it faced stiff competition from the well established ''[[The Hindu '' and the ''Mail'', as well as several other prominent newspapers. In the late 1930s the newspaper's circulation was no more than 2000.  In 1939 Goenka bought ''[[Andhra Prabha '', another prominent [[Telugu language|Telugu  daily newspaper. The name [[Three Musketeers  was often used for the three dailies. In 1940 the whole premises was gutted by fire. ''[[The Hindu '', a rival newspaper, helped considerably in re-launching the paper, by getting it printed temporarily at one of its Swadesimithran's press and later offering its recently vacated premises at 2, Mount Road, which became the landmark Express Estates. This relocation also helped the Express obtain better high speed printing machines. Some claimed the Goenka had deliberately set fire to escape financial embarrassment.  In later years Goenka started the [[Mumbai  edition with the landmark [[Express Towers  as his office when he bought the ''Morning Standard'' in 1944. Two years later it became the Mumbai edition of ''The Indian Express''. Later, editions were started in several cities; the [[Madurai  edition in 1957, the [[Bangalore  edition in 1965, and the [[Ahmedabad  edition in 1968. The ''[[The Financial Express  India |Financial Express '' was launched in 1961 at Mumbai, [[Kannada Prabha   [[Kannada language|Kannada  Daily  at [[Bangalore  in 1965 and a Bangalore edition of the Telugu Daily ''Andhra Prabha'', and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati  dailies Lok Satta and Jansatta, from Ahmedabad and Vadodara in 1952.  The [[Delhi  edition started was when the Tej group's ''Indian News Chronicle'' was acquired in 1951, which in 1953 became the Delhi edition of ''Indian Express''. In 1990 the group bought the Sterling group of magazines, along with it the ''Gentleman'' magazine.  After Ramanath Goenka's death in 1991, two of the family members split the group into Indian Express Mumbai with all the North Indian editions, while the Southern editions were grouped as Express Madurai Ltd. with [[Chennai  as headquarters.  ''The Indian Express'' began publishing daily on the [[World Wide Web  on 8 July 1996. Five months later, the website ''expressindia.com'' attracted ""700,000 hits every day, excepting weekends when it [fell] to 60% of its normal levels"".  ==Headquarters== The [[Indian Express Limited|Indian Express Group  has a Mumbai-headquartered division, which should not be confused with Express Publications [[Madurai , which has a [[South India n chain of newspapers, including ''[[The New Indian Express '' a separate corporate entity from The Express Group. The Indian Express's main newsroom is in Noida. Mumbai is a bureau. A national desk brings out all editions in Delhi. The management, however, still sits in Mumbai.  ==Awards==  * [[Ramnath Goenka Excellence in Journalism Awards  * Ramnath Goenka India Press Photo Awards * [[Star Screen Awards|Screen Awards  * FE Women in Business Awards * Intelligent Enterprise Awards * Security Strategist Awards * Uptime Champion Awards * Express TravelWorld Awards * Pharma Excellence Awards * Healthcare Excellence Awards   ==See also==   * [[Indian Express Group  * [[Express Avenue  * [[List of newspapers in India by circulation  * [[List of newspapers in the world by circulation  * ''[[The New Indian Express ''   ==References==   ==External links== * [http://www.indianexpress.com ''The Indian Express'' website]       [[Category:Publications established in 1931  [[Category:1931 establishments in India  [[Category:English-language newspapers published in India  [[Category:Newspapers published in Kolkata  [[Category:Newspapers published in Delhi  [[Category:Newspapers published in Mumbai  [[Category:Indian Express Limited  [[Category:National newspapers published in India ","The Indian Express is an English-language Indian daily newspaper.

It is published by [[Condé Nast . Started as a weekly in 1925, the magazine is now published 47 times annually, with five of these issues covering two-week spans.  Although its reviews and events listings often focus on the [[Culture of New York City|cultural life of New York City , ''The New Yorker'' has a wide audience outside New York and is read internationally. It is well known for its illustrated and often topical covers, its commentaries on [[popular culture  and eccentric [[Americana , its attention to modern [[fiction  by the inclusion of [[Short story|short stories  and literary [[reviews , its rigorous [[Fact checker|fact checking  and [[copy editing ,<ref name=""TED Talk""></ref> its [[journalism  on politics and [[social issues , and its single-panel [[cartoon s sprinkled throughout each issue.  == History == ''The New Yorker'' debuted on February 21, 1925. It was founded by [[Harold Ross  and his wife, [[Jane Grant , a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times '' reporter. Ross wanted to create a sophisticated humor magazine that would be different from perceivably ""corny"" humor publications such as ''[[Judge  magazine |Judge '', where he had worked, or the old ''[[Life  magazine |Life ''. Ross partnered with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann  who founded the General Baking Company  to establish the F-R Publishing Company. The magazine's first offices were at 25 West 45th Street in [[Manhattan . Ross edited the magazine until his death in 1951. During the early, occasionally precarious years of its existence, the magazine prided itself on its cosmopolitan sophistication. Ross famously declared in a 1925 prospectus for the magazine: ""It has announced that it is not edited for the old lady in [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque .""  Although the magazine never lost its touches of humor, it soon established itself as a pre-eminent forum for serious [[fiction , [[essays  and journalism. Shortly after the end of [[World War II , [[John Hersey 's essay ''[[Hiroshima  book |Hiroshima '' filled an entire issue. In subsequent decades the magazine published short stories by many of the most respected writers of the 20th and 21st centuries, including [[Ann Beattie , [[Truman Capote , [[John Cheever , [[Roald Dahl , [[Mavis Gallant , [[Geoffrey T. Hellman|Geoffrey Hellman , [[John McNulty  journalist |John McNulty , [[Joseph Mitchell  writer |Joseph Mitchell , [[Alice Munro , [[Haruki Murakami , [[Vladimir Nabokov , [[John O'Hara , [[Dorothy Parker , [[Philip Roth , [[J. D. Salinger , [[Irwin Shaw , [[James Thurber , [[John Updike , [[Eudora Welty , [[Stephen King , and [[E. B. White . Publication of [[Shirley Jackson 's ""[[The Lottery "" drew more mail than any other story in the magazine's history.<ref name=""Lottery letters""></ref>  In its early decades, the magazine sometimes published two or even three short stories a week, but in recent years the pace has remained steady at one story per issue. While some styles and themes recur more often than others in its fiction, the stories are marked less by uniformity than by variety, and they have ranged from Updike's introspective domestic narratives to the surrealism of [[Donald Barthelme , and from parochial accounts of the lives of neurotic New Yorkers to stories set in a wide range of locations and eras and translated from many languages. [[Kurt Vonnegut  said that ''The New Yorker'' has been an effective instrument for getting a large audience to appreciate modern literature. Vonnegut's 1974 interview with Joe David Bellamy and John Casey contained a discussion of ''The New Yorker''s influence:   The non-fiction feature articles  which usually make up the bulk of the magazine's content  cover an eclectic array of topics. Recent subjects have included eccentric evangelist [[Creflo Dollar , the different ways in which humans perceive the passage of time, and [[Münchausen syndrome by proxy .  The magazine is notable for its editorial traditions. Under the rubric ''Profiles'', it publishes articles about notable people such as [[Ernest Hemingway , [[Henry Luce|Henry R. Luce  and [[Marlon Brando , Hollywood restaurateur [[Michael Romanoff , magician [[Ricky Jay  and mathematicians [[Chudnovsky brothers|David and Gregory Chudnovsky . Other enduring features have been ""Goings on About Town"", a listing of cultural and entertainment events in New York, and ""The Talk of the Town"", a miscellany of brief pieces—frequently humorous, whimsical or eccentric vignettes of life in New York—written in a breezily light style, or [[feuilleton , although in recent years the section often begins with a serious commentary. For many years, newspaper snippets containing amusing errors, unintended meanings or badly mixed metaphors  ""Block That Metaphor""  have been used as filler items, accompanied by a witty retort. There is no masthead listing the editors and staff. And despite some changes, the magazine has kept much of its traditional appearance over the decades in typography, layout, covers and artwork. The magazine was acquired by [[Advance Publications , the media company owned by [[Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr.|Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr , in 1985, for $200&nbsp;million when it was earning less than $6&nbsp;million a year.<ref name=""mahon19890910""></ref>  Ross was succeeded as editor by [[William Shawn   1951–87 , followed by [[Robert Gottlieb   1987–92  and [[Tina Brown   1992–98 . Among the important nonfiction authors who began writing for the magazine during Shawn's editorship were [[Dwight Macdonald , [[Kenneth Tynan , and [[Hannah Arendt ; to a certain extent all three authors were controversial, Arendt the most obviously so  her ''Eichmann in Jerusalem'' reportage appeared in the magazine before it was published as a book , but in each case Shawn proved an active champion.  Brown's nearly six-year tenure attracted more controversy than Gottlieb's or even Shawn's, thanks to her high profile  Shawn, by contrast, had been an extremely shy, introverted figure  and the changes which she made to a magazine that had retained a similar look and feel for the previous half-century. She introduced color to the editorial pages  several years before ''[[The New York Times ''  and photography, with less type on each page and a generally more modern layout. More substantively, she increased the coverage of current events and hot topics such as celebrities and business tycoons, and placed short pieces throughout ""Goings on About Town"", including a racy column about nightlife in Manhattan. A new letters-to-the-editor page and the addition of authors' bylines to their ""Talk of the Town"" pieces had the effect of making the magazine more personal. The current editor of ''The New Yorker'' is [[David Remnick , who succeeded Brown in July 1998.  [[Tom Wolfe  wrote about the magazine: ""The ''New Yorker'' style was one of leisurely meandering understatement, droll when in the humorous mode, tautological and litotical when in the serious mode, constantly amplified, qualified, adumbrated upon, nuanced and renuanced, until the magazine's pale-gray pages became High Baroque triumphs of the relative clause and appository modifier"".  Joseph Rosenblum, reviewing [[Ben Yagoda 's ''About Town'', a history of the magazine from 1925 to 1985, wrote, ""...''The New Yorker'' did create its own universe. As one longtime reader wrote to Yagoda, this was a place 'where [[Peter DeVries  ... was forever lifting a glass of [[Piesporter , where [[Niccolò Tucci   in a plum velvet [[dinner jacket   flirted in Italian with [[Muriel Spark , where Nabokov sipped tawny [[Port wine|port  from a prismatic goblet  while a [[Vanessa atalanta|Red Admirable  perched on his pinky , and where John Updike tripped over the master's Swiss shoes, excusing himself charmingly.  As far back as the 1940s the magazine's commitment to [[Fact checker|fact-checking  was already well known. Yet the magazine played a role in a literary scandal and defamation lawsuit over two 1990s articles by [[Janet Malcolm , who wrote about [[Sigmund Freud 's legacy. Questions were raised about the magazine's fact-checking process. As of 2010, ''The New Yorker'' employs 16 fact checkers. In July 2011, the magazine was sued for defamation in [[United States district court  for a July 12, 2010 article written by David Grann,<ref name=""adweek.com"">Dylan Byers, [http://www.adweek.com/news/press/forensic-art-expert-sues-new-yorker-author-133109 ""Forensic Art Expert Sues ''New Yorker'' – Author Wants $2 million for defamation over David Grann piece""], ''[[Adweek '', June 30, 2011.</ref> but the case was summarily dismissed.<ref name=""villagevoice.com""></ref>  Since the late 1990s, ''The New Yorker'' has used the Internet to publish current and archived material. It maintains a website with some content from the current issue  plus exclusive web-only content . Subscribers have access to the full current issue online, as well as a complete archive of back issues viewable as they were originally printed. In addition, ''The New Yorker''s cartoons are available for purchase online. A digital archive of back issues from 1925 to April 2008  representing more than 4,000 issues and half a million pages  has also been issued on DVD-ROMs and on a small portable hard drive. More recently, an iPad version of the current issue of the magazine has been released.  In its November 1, 2004 issue, the magazine for the first time endorsed a presidential candidate, choosing to endorse [[Democratic Party  United States |Democrat  [[John Kerry  over incumbent [[Republican Party  United States |Republican  [[George W. Bush . This was continued in 2008 when the magazine endorsed [[Barack Obama  over [[John McCain , in 2012 when it endorsed Obama over [[Mitt Romney , and in 2016 when it endorsed [[Hillary Clinton  over [[Donald Trump .  === Influence === ''The New Yorker'' influenced a number of similar magazines including [[The Brooklynite  magazine |''The Brooklynite''   1926 to 1930 , ''[[The Chicagoan ''  1926 to 1935  and Paris's ''[[The Boulevardier ''  1927 to 1932 .  == Cartoons == ''The New Yorker'' has featured cartoons  usually [[gag cartoon s  since it began publication in 1925. The cartoon editor of ''The New Yorker'' for years was [[Lee Lorenz , who first began cartooning in 1956 and became a ''New Yorker'' contract contributor in 1958. After serving as the magazine's art editor from 1973 to 1993  when he was replaced by [[Françoise Mouly  , he continued in the position of cartoon editor until 1998. His book ''The Art of the New Yorker: 1925–1995''  Knopf, 1995  was the first comprehensive survey of all aspects of the magazine's graphics. In 1998, [[Robert Mankoff  took over as cartoon editor and edited at least 14 collections of ''New Yorker'' cartoons. In addition, Mankoff usually contributed a short article to each book, describing some aspect of the cartooning process or the methods used to select cartoons for the magazine. Mankoff left the magazine in 2017.  ''The New Yorker''s stable of cartoonists has included many important talents in American humor, including [[Charles Addams , [[Peter Arno , [[Charles Barsotti , [[George Booth  cartoonist |George Booth , [[Roz Chast , [[Tom Cheney  cartoonist |Tom Cheney , [[Sam Cobean , [[Leo Cullum , [[Richard Decker , [[Pia Guerra , [[J. B. Handelsman , [[Helen E. Hokinson , [[Ed Koren , [[Reginald Marsh  artist |Reginald Marsh , [[Mary Petty , [[George Price  New Yorker cartoonist |George Price , [[Charles Saxon , [[David Snell  journalist |David Snell , [[Otto Soglow , [[Saul Steinberg , [[William Steig , [[James Stevenson  illustrator |James Stevenson , Richard Taylor, [[James Thurber , [[Pete Holmes , Barney Tobey, and [[Gahan Wilson .  Many early ''New Yorker'' cartoonists did not caption their own cartoons. In his book ''The Years with Ross'', Thurber describes the newspaper's weekly art meeting, where cartoons submitted over the previous week would be brought up from the mail room to be gone over by Ross, the editorial department, and a number of staff writers. Cartoons often would be rejected or sent back to artists with requested amendments, while others would be accepted and captions written for them. Some artists hired their own writers; Helen Hokinson hired James Reid Parker in 1931.  [[Brendan Gill  relates in his book ''Here at The New Yorker'' that at one point in the early 1940s, the quality of the artwork submitted to the magazine seemed to improve. It later was found out that the office boy  a teen-aged [[Truman Capote   had been acting as a volunteer art editor, dropping pieces he didn't like down the far edge of his desk.   Several of the magazine's cartoons have climbed to a higher plateau of fame. One 1928 cartoon drawn by [[Carl Rose  cartoonist |Carl Rose  and captioned by [[E.&nbsp;B. White  shows a mother telling her daughter, ""It's broccoli, dear."" The daughter responds, ""I say it's spinach and I say the hell with it."" The phrase ""[[I say it's spinach "" entered the vernacular  and three years later, the Broadway musical ''Face the Music'' included [[Irving Berlin 's musical number entitled ""[[I Say It's Spinach  And the Hell with It  "" . The [[catchphrase  ""[[wikt:back to the drawing board|back to the drawing board "" originated with the 1941 Peter Arno cartoon showing an engineer walking away from a crashed plane, saying, ""Well, back to the old drawing board.""  The most reprinted is [[Peter Steiner  cartoonist |Peter Steiner 's 1993 drawing of two dogs at a computer, with one saying, ""[[On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog "". According to Mankoff, Steiner and the magazine have split more than $100,000 in fees paid for the licensing and reprinting of this single cartoon, with more than half going to Steiner.  Over seven decades, many hardcover compilations of cartoons from ''The New Yorker'' have been published, and in 2004, Mankoff edited ''The Complete Cartoons of The New Yorker'', a 656-page collection with 2004 of the magazine's best cartoons published during 80 years, plus a double CD set with all 68,647 cartoons ever published in the magazine. This features a search function allowing readers to search for cartoons by a cartoonist's name or by year of publication. The newer group of cartoonists in recent years includes [[Pat Byrnes , Frank Cotham, Michael Crawford, Joe Dator, Drew Dernavich, [[J. C. Duffy , Carolita Johnson, Zachary Kanin, Farley Katz, [[Robert Leighton  cartoonist |Robert Leighton , Glen Le Lievre, [[Michael Maslin , Ariel Molvig, Paul Noth, Barbara Smaller, David Sipress, Mick Stevens, [[Julia Suits , Christopher Weyant, [[P. C. Vey , and Jack Ziegler. The notion that some ''New Yorker'' cartoons have punchlines so ''[[Non sequitur  absurdism |non sequitur '' that they are impossible to understand became a subplot in the ''[[Seinfeld '' episode ""[[The Cartoon "", as well as a playful jab in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons '', ""[[The Sweetest Apu "".  In April 2005, the magazine began using the last page of each issue for ""The New Yorker Cartoon [[Caption Contest "". Captionless cartoons by ''The New Yorker''s regular cartoonists are printed each week. Captions are submitted by readers, and three are chosen as finalists. Readers then vote on the winner. Anyone age thirteen or older can enter or vote. Each contest winner receives a print of the cartoon  with the winning caption , signed by the artist who drew the cartoon.  == Films == ''The New Yorker'' has been the source of a number of movies. Both fiction and non-fiction pieces have been adapted for the big screen, including ''[[Flash of Genius  film |Flash of Genius ''  2008 , based on a true account of the invention of the intermittent windshield wiper by [[John Seabrook ; ''[[Away From Her '', adapted from Alice Munro's short story ""The Bear Came over the Mountain"", which debuted at the 2007 [[Sundance Film Festival ; ''[[The Namesake  film |The Namesake ''  2007 , similarly based on [[Jhumpa Lahiri 's novel, which originated as a short story in the magazine; ''[[The Bridge  2006 documentary film |The Bridge ''  2006 , based on [[Tad Friend 's 2003 non-fiction piece ""Jumpers""; ''[[Brokeback Mountain ''  2005 , an adaptation of the short story by [[E. Annie Proulx|Annie Proulx  that first appeared in the October 13, 1997, issue of ''The New Yorker''; [[Jonathan Safran Foer 's 2001 debut in ''The New Yorker'', which later came to theaters in Liev Schreiber's debut as both screenwriter and director, ''[[Everything Is Illuminated  film |Everything Is Illuminated ''  2005 ; [[Michael Cunningham 's'' [[The Hours  film |The Hours '', which appeared in the pages of ''The New Yorker'' before becoming the film that garnered the 2002 Best Actress Academy Award for [[Nicole Kidman ; ''[[Adaptation  film |Adaptation ''  2002 , which [[Charlie Kaufman  based on [[Susan Orlean 's ''The Orchid Thief'', written for ''The New Yorker''; Frank McCourt's ''[[Angela's Ashes '', which also appeared, in part, in ''The New Yorker'' in 1996 before its film adaptation was released in 1999; ''[[The Addams Family  1991 film |The Addams Family ''  1991  and its sequel, ''[[Addams Family Values ''  1993 , both inspired by the work of famed ''New Yorker'' cartoonist [[Charles Addams ; [[Brian De Palma 's ''[[Casualties of War ''  1989 , which began as a ''New Yorker'' article by Daniel Lang; ''[[Boys Don't Cry  film |Boys Don't Cry ''  1999 , starring Hilary Swank, began as an article in the magazine, and ''[[Iris  2001 film |Iris ''  2001 , about the life of Iris Murdoch and John Bayley, the article written by John Bayley for ''The New Yorker'', before he completed his full memoir, the film starring Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent; ''[[The Swimmer  1968 film |The Swimmer ''  1968 , starring [[Burt Lancaster , based on a John Cheever short story from ''The New Yorker''; ''[[In Cold Blood ''  1967 , the widely nominated adaptation of the 1965 non-fiction serial written for ''The New Yorker'' by [[Truman Capote ; ''[[Pal Joey  film |Pal Joey ''  1957 , based on a series of stories by John O'Hara; ''[[Mister 880 ''  1950 , starring [[Edmund Gwenn , based on a story by longtime editor [[St. Clair McKelway ; ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty  1947 film |The Secret Life of Walter Mitty ''  1947 , which began as a story by longtime ''New Yorker'' contributor James Thurber; and ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis  film |Meet Me in St. Louis ''  1944 , adapted from [[Sally Benson 's short stories.  The history of ''The New Yorker'' has also been portrayed in film: In ''[[Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle '', a film about the celebrated [[Algonquin Round Table  starring [[Jennifer Jason Leigh  as [[Dorothy Parker , [[Sam Robards  portrays founding editor Harold Ross trying to drum up support for his fledgling publication. The magazine's former editor, [[William Shawn , is portrayed in ''[[Capote  film |Capote ''  2005 , ''[[Infamous  film |Infamous ''  2006  and ''[[Hannah Arendt  film |Hannah Arendt ''  2012 .  The 2015 documentary ''Very Semi-Serious'', produced by Redora Films, presents a behind-the-scenes look at the cartoons of ''The New Yorker''.  <!-- Commented out: [[File:New Yorker 1980 10 27 p194.jpg|frame|Example of former [[semicolon  usage from issue of October 27, 1980. On the third line, the semicolon after ""cormorants"" appears before the closing quotation mark.  -->  == Style == ''The New Yorker''s signature display typeface, used for its nameplate and headlines and the masthead above ''The Talk of the Town'' section, is Irvin, named after its creator, the designer-illustrator [[Rea Irvin . The body text of all articles in ''The New Yorker'' is set in [[Caslon|Adobe Caslon .<ref name=""caslonref""></ref>  One uncommonly formal feature of the magazine's in-house [[style guide|style  is the placement of [[Diaeresis  diacritic |diaeresis marks  in words with repeating [[vowel s—such as ''reëlected'', ''preëminent'', and ''coöperate''—in which the two vowel letters indicate separate vowel sounds. The magazine also continues to use a few spellings that are otherwise little used, such as ''focussed'', ''venders'', ''teen-ager'', ''traveller'', ''marvellous'', ''carrousel'', and ''cannister''.  The magazine also spells out the names of numerical amounts, such as ""two million three hundred thousand dollars"" instead of ""$2.3&nbsp;million"", even for very large figures.  == Readership == Despite its title, ''The New Yorker'' is read nationwide, with 53 percent of its circulation in the top 10 U.S. metropolitan areas. According to Mediamark Research Inc., the average age of ''The New Yorker'' reader in 2009 was 47  compared to 43 in 1980 and 46 in 1990 . The average household income of ''The New Yorker'' readers in 2009 was $109,877  the average income in 1980 was $62,788 and the average income in 1990 was $70,233 .  According to Pew Research, 77 percent of ''The New Yorker's'' audience hold left-of-center political values, while 52 percent of those readers hold ""consistently liberal"" political values.  == Eustace Tilley == [[File:Alfred D’Orsay.png|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Image of [[Alfred d'Orsay|Count d'Orsay , published by [[James Baillie Fraser|James Fraser .  The magazine's first cover illustration, a [[dandy  peering at a butterfly through a [[monocle , was drawn by [[Rea Irvin , the magazine's first art editor, based on an 1834 caricature of the then [[Alfred Guillaume Gabriel, Count d'Orsay|Count d'Orsay  which appeared as an illustration in the 11th edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica ''. The gentleman on the original cover, now referred to as ""Eustace Tilley"", is a character created by [[Corey Ford  for ''The New Yorker''. The hero of a series entitled ""The Making of a Magazine"", which began on the inside front cover of the August 8 issue that first summer, Tilley was a younger man than the figure on the original cover. His top hat was of a newer style, without the curved brim. He wore a [[morning coat  and striped trousers. Ford borrowed Eustace Tilley's last name from an aunt—he had always found it vaguely humorous. ""Eustace"" was selected by Ford for [[Phonaesthetics|euphony .  The character has become a kind of [[mascot  for ''The New Yorker'', frequently appearing in its pages and on promotional materials. Traditionally, Rea Irvin's original Tilley cover illustration is used every year on the issue closest to the anniversary date of February 21, though on several occasions a newly drawn variation has been substituted.  == Covers ==  The magazine is well known for its illustrated and often topical covers.  === ""View of the World"" cover ===  [[File:Steinberg New Yorker Cover.png|thumb|right|[[Saul Steinberg 's ""View of the World from Ninth Avenue"" cover  Saul Steinberg created 85 covers and 642 internal drawings and illustrations for the magazine. His most famous work is probably its March 29, 1976 cover, an illustration most often referred to as ""View of the World from [[Ninth Avenue  Manhattan |9th Avenue "", sometimes referred to as ""A [[parochialism|Parochial  New Yorker's View of the World"" or ""A New Yorker's View of the World"", which depicts a map of the world as seen by [[narcissism|self-absorbed  New Yorkers.  The illustration is split in two, with the bottom half of the image showing [[Manhattan 's 9th Avenue, [[Tenth Avenue  Manhattan |10th Avenue , and the [[Hudson River   appropriately labeled , and the top half depicting the rest of the world. The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a square, with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing [[New Jersey|""Jersey"" , the names of five cities  [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles ; [[Washington, D.C. ; [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas ; [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City ; and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago   and three states  [[Texas , [[Utah , and [[Nebraska   scattered among a few rocks for the United States beyond New Jersey. The Pacific Ocean, perhaps half again as wide as the Hudson, separates the United States from three flattened land masses labeled China, Japan and Russia.  The illustration—humorously depicting New Yorkers' self-image of their place in the world, or perhaps outsiders' view of New Yorkers' self-image—inspired many similar works, including the poster for the [[1984 in film|1984 film  ''[[Moscow on the Hudson ''; that movie poster led to a lawsuit, ''[[Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. '', 663 F. Supp. 706  [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|S.D.N.Y.  1987 , which held that [[Columbia Pictures  violated the [[copyright  that Steinberg held on his work.  The cover was later satirized by Barry Blitt for the cover of ''The New Yorker'' on October 6, 2008. The cover featured [[Sarah Palin  looking out of her window seeing only Alaska, with Russia in the far background.  The March 21, 2009 cover of ''[[The Economist '', ""How China sees the World"", is also an homage to the original image, but depicting the viewpoint from Beijing's [[Chang'an Avenue  instead of Manhattan.  === 9/11 === Hired by Tina Brown in 1992, [[Art Spiegelman  worked for ''The New Yorker'' for ten years but resigned a few months after the [[September&nbsp;11 terrorist attacks . The cover created by Françoise Mouly and Spiegelman for the September 24, 2001 issue of ''The New Yorker'' received wide acclaim and was voted in the top ten of magazine covers of the past 40 years by the American Society of Magazine Editors, which commented:   At first glance, the cover appears to be totally black, but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of the [[World Trade Center  1973–2001 |World Trade Center  towers in a slightly darker shade of black. In some situations, the ghost images become visible only when the magazine is tilted toward a light source. In September 2004, Spiegelman reprised the image on the cover of his book ''[[In the Shadow of No Towers '', in which he relates his experience of the Twin Towers attack and the psychological after-effects.  === ""New Yorkistan"" ===  In the December 2001 issue the magazine printed a cover by [[Maira Kalman  and [[Rick Meyerowitz  showing a map of New York in which various neighborhoods were labeled with humorous names reminiscent of Middle Eastern and Central Asian place names and referencing the neighborhood's real name or characteristics  e.g., ""Fuhgeddabouditstan"", ""Botoxia"" . The cover had some cultural resonance in the wake of September 11, and became a popular print and poster.  === Controversial covers === ==== Crown Heights in 1993 ==== For the 1993 [[Valentine's Day  issue, the magazine cover by [[Art Spiegelman  depicted a black woman and a [[Hasidic Jew ish man kissing, referencing the [[Crown Heights riot  of 1991.<ref name=""npr""></ref> The cover was criticized by both black and Jewish observers.<ref name='shapiro'></ref> Jack Salzman and [[Cornel West  describe the reaction to the cover as the magazine's ""first national controversy"".<ref name='salzman'></ref>  ==== 2008 Obama cover satire and controversy ==== [[File:New Yorker magazine Politics of Fear.png|thumb|right|Barry Blitt's cover from the July 21, 2008 issue of ''The New Yorker''   ""The Politics of Fear"", a cartoon by [[Barry Blitt  featured on the cover of the July 21, 2008 issue, depicts then presumptive [[Democratic Party  United States |Democratic  [[United States presidential election, 2008|presidential  nominee [[Barack Obama  in the [[turban  and [[salwar kameez  typical of many [[Muslim s, [[fist bump ing with his wife, [[Michelle Obama|Michelle , portrayed with an [[Afro  and wearing [[Military camouflage|camouflage  trousers with an [[assault rifle  slung over her back. They are standing in the [[Oval Office , with a portrait of [[Osama Bin Laden  hanging on the wall and an [[American flag  [[Flag desecration|burning  in the fireplace in the background.  Many ''New Yorker'' readers saw the image as a lampoon of ""The Politics of Fear"", as was its title. Some of Obama's supporters as well as his presumptive Republican opponent, [[John McCain|Sen. John McCain , accused the magazine of publishing an incendiary cartoon whose irony could be lost on some readers. However, editor David Remnick felt the image's obvious excesses rebuffed the concern that it could be misunderstood, even by those unfamiliar with the magazine. ""The intent of the cover"", he said, ""is to satirize the vicious and racist attacks and rumors and misconceptions about the Obamas that have been floating around in the [[blogosphere  and are reflected in public opinion polls. What we set out to do was to throw all these images together, which are all over the top and to shine a kind of harsh light on them, to satirize them.""  In an interview on ''[[Larry King Live '' shortly after the magazine issue began circulating, Obama said, ""Well, I know it was ''The New Yorker''s attempt at satire... I don't think they were entirely successful with it"". But Obama also pointed to his own efforts to debunk the allegations portrayed in ''The New Yorker'' cover through a web site his campaign set up, stating that the allegations were ""actually an insult against Muslim-Americans"".  Later that week, ''[[The Daily Show ''s [[Jon Stewart  continued ''The New Yorker'' cover's argument about Obama stereotypes with a piece showcasing a montage of clips containing such stereotypes culled from various legitimate news sources. The ''New Yorker'' Obama cover was later parodied by Stewart and [[Stephen Colbert  on the October 3, 2008, cover of ''[[Entertainment Weekly '' magazine, with Stewart as Obama and Colbert as Michelle, photographed for the magazine in New York City on September 18.  ''New Yorker'' covers are not always related to the contents of the magazine or are only tangentially so. In this case, the article in the July 21, 2008, issue about Obama did not discuss the attacks and rumors but rather Obama's political career. The magazine later endorsed Obama for president.  This parody was most likely inspired by [[Fox News  host [[E. D. Hill 's paraphrasing of an anonymous internet comment in asking whether a gesture made by Obama and his wife Michelle was a ""terrorist fist jab"". Later, Hill's contract was not renewed.  ==== 2013 Bert and Ernie cover ==== ''The New Yorker'' chose an image of [[Bert and Ernie  by artist Jack Hunter, entitled 'Moment of Joy', as the cover of their July 8, 2013 publication, which covers the Supreme Court decisions on the [[Defense of Marriage Act  and [[California Proposition 8 .<ref name=""New Yorker""></ref> The ''[[Sesame Street '' characters have long been rumored in popular culture and urban legend to be [[homosexual  partners, though [[Sesame Workshop  has repeatedly denied this, saying they are merely ""puppets"" and have no sexual orientation.<ref name=""snopes""></ref> Reaction was mixed. Online magazine ''[[Slate  magazine |Slate '' criticized the cover, which shows Ernie leaning on Bert's shoulder as they watch a television with the Supreme Court justices on the screen, saying ""it's a terrible way to commemorate a major civil-rights victory for gay and lesbian couples."" ''[[The Huffington Post '', meanwhile, said it was ""one of [the magazine's] most awesome covers of all time"".<ref name=""ABC News""></ref>  == Books == *''Ross and the New Yorker'' by Dale Kramer  1951  *''The Years with Ross'' by [[James Thurber   1959  *''Ross, the New Yorker and Me'' by [[Jane Grant   1968  *''[[Here at The New Yorker '' by [[Brendan Gill   1975  *''About the New Yorker and Me'' by [[Ely Jacques Kahn, Jr.|E.J.

On [[Independence Day  United States |Independence Day  2008, the AFA announced a boycott of [[McDonald's , which had a director on the board of the [[National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce .

On August 25, 2008, the AFA announced their boycott of [[Hallmark Cards  for their decision to start selling same-sex wedding cards.  In December 2008, the AFA issued an ""Action Alert"" which called for members to protest about the [[Campbell Soup Company , which had purchased two two-page advertisements in the December 2008 and January 2009 issues of LGBT magazine ''[[The Advocate  LGBT magazine |The Advocate ''.  The Action Alert said that Campbell's ""sent a message that homosexual parents constitute a family and are worthy of support"".  The advertisements showed a married lesbian couple with their son. AFA spokesman Randy Sharp said ""the Campbell Soup Company is saying 'we approve of homosexual marriage.'""  In November 2009, the AFA called for a boycott against clothing retailer [[Gap  clothing retailer |The Gap, Inc. , claiming the retailer's holiday television advertising campaign failed to mention Christmas.  ""Christmas has historically been very good for commerce. But now Gap wants the commerce but no Christmas"" wrote an AFA spokesperson.  The Gap soon released an advertisement in response to the boycott, specifically referring to Christmas, albeit with a number of other holidays that take place at the same time of year and added the word ""Christmas"" to in-store decor.  In 2012 the AFA led a boycott against [[Archie Comics  when they published a comic book featuring a [[same-sex marriage .  In July 2012, they considered boycotting [[Google  due to Google's ""[[Legalize Love "" campaign which supports [[LGBT  rights.  In April 2016, AFA launched a boycott against [[Target Corporation  due to Target announcing they ""welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.""  This has become AFA's most successful boycott effort to date, allegedly generating over 1,200,000 signatures on their online petition, with people committing to shop elsewhere. The exact number of signatories is unknown, since the petition did not attempt to prevent duplicate or invalid signatures.  === Published media === On April 16, 2007, following the [[Virginia Tech Massacre , the AFA released a video titled ''The Day They Kicked God out of the Schools'', in which God tells a student that students were killed in schools because God isn't allowed in schools anymore.  The video claims that the shootings at [[Virginia Tech massacre|Virginia Tech  and [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine , among others, are in part the result of: decreased discipline in schools; no [[School prayer|prayer in schools ; sex out of wedlock; rampant violence in TV, movies, and music; or abortions.

In 2009, a one-hour special version of the program was produced and aired on commercial television stations, where AFA purchased the air time.  === Sexual morality === The AFA has repeatedly lobbied Congress to eliminate funding for the [[National Endowment for the Arts .<ref name=sherkatellison>Darren E Sherkat, Christopher G Ellison, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2580526 The cognitive structure of a moral crusade: Conservative protestantism and opposition to pornography], ''Social Forces'', Mar 1997.

In a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post '' editorial in response to the complaint, Young stated, ""I find it strange that an organization that claims to uphold family values and to oppose the federal funding of obscenity is not protesting the part of the military budget that goes to support [[pederasty  in the Far East.""  Speaking in defense of [[Mike Huckabee 's statements that people with [[AIDS  should be quarantined, the head of the AFA of [[Pennsylvania  said Huckabee's comments were being taken out of context, and that the measures Huckabee recommended in reference to people with AIDS were appropriate.  ===View on media=== Wildmon has been accused of saying that he believes Hollywood and the theater world are heavily influenced by [[Jewish people , and that television network executives and advertisers have a genuine hostility towards Christians.<ref name=brackman00>Brackman, H.

The Action Alert, entitled ""A first for America...The Koran replaces the Bible at swearing-in oath: What book will America base its values on, the Bible or the Koran?"", requested subscribers to write to their Congressional representatives and urge them to create a ""law making the Bible the book used in the swearing-in ceremony of representatives and senators.""  On July 13, 2007, a [[Hindu  prayer [[Rajan Zed prayer protest|was conducted  in the [[U.S. Senate . Rajan Zed, director of interfaith relations at a Hindu temple, read the prayer at the invitation of Senate [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|majority leader  [[Harry Reid , who defended his invitation based on the ideals of [[Mahatma Gandhi . AFA sent out an ""Action Alert"" to its members to email, write letters, or call their senators to oppose the Hindu prayer, stating it is ""seeking the invocation of a non-monotheistic god.""<ref name=""HinduPrayer"">""[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19729245/ Hindu Prayer in Senate Disrupted]."" [[Associated Press   published on [[MSNBC  . June 12, 2007. Retrieved on June 15, 2007</ref>  The ""alert"" stated that ""since Hindus worship multiple gods, the prayer will be completely outside the American paradigm, flying in the face of the American motto ''One Nation Under God.''""  The convocation by Zed was in fact disrupted by three protesters from a different [[Fundamentalist Christian  activist group, [[Operation Save America , in the gallery; they reportedly shouted ""this is an abomination"", and called themselves ""Christians and patriots"".<ref name=""HinduPrayer"" />  On August 10, 2010, [[Bryan Fischer , AFA's director of Issue Analysis for Government and Public Policy, posted on his blog on the AFA website that ""Permits should not be granted to build even one more mosque in the United States of America, let alone the monstrosity planned for Ground Zero. This is for one simple reason: each Islamic mosque is dedicated to the overthrow of the American government."" Fischer continued: ""Because of this subversive ideology, Muslims cannot claim religious freedom protections under the First Amendment.""  === Homosexuality ===  The AFA expresses public concern over what it refers to as the ""[[homosexual agenda "". They state that the Bible ""declares that homosexuality is unnatural and sinful"" and that they have ""sponsored several events reaching out to homosexuals and letting them know there is love and healing at the Cross of Christ.""  The AFA actively lobbies against the social acceptance of homosexual behavior  ""''We oppose the homosexual movement's efforts to convince our society that their behavior is normal''"" .  The AFA also actively promotes the idea that homosexuality is a choice and that sexual orientation can be changed through [[ex-gay  ministries.<ref name=""nsrc_exgay""></ref>  In 1996, responding to a complaint from an AFA member who was participating in an AFA campaign targeting gay journalists, the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram '' transferred a gay editor out of a job that occasionally required him to work with schoolchildren. The AFA targeted the editor due to cartoon strips he created, which were published in gay magazines. The paper apparently acted on the AFA's unsubstantiated statement that the editor was ""preoccupied with the subjects of pedophilia and incest.""  In 2000, vice president Tim Wildmon spoke out against [[gay-straight alliance  clubs in schools, stating, ""We view these kinds of clubs as an advancement of the homosexual cause.""  In 2003, the AFA filed an amicus curiae brief in Lawrence vs Texas, arguing against repeal of Texas sodomy laws. In 2004, the AFA raised concerns about the movie ''[[Shark Tale '' because the group believed the movie was designed to promote the acceptance of gay rights by children.<ref name=mediatrans/>  On the October 11, 2005, AFA broadcast, Tim Wildmon agreed with a caller that cable networks like [[Animal Planet  and [[HGTV  featured ""evidence of homosexuality and lesbian people"" and added that ""you have to watch out for children's programs today as well because they'll slip it in there as well.""  In 2007, the AFA spoke out against [[IKEA  for featuring gay families in their television ads.  In June 2008, the AFA protested a [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz  television advertisement, shown in the United Kingdom, which showed two men kissing, which Heinz then withdrew.  On January 28, 2015, the AFA wrote to the Southern Poverty Law Center that the AFA now rejected the policy that homosexual conduct should be illegal.  The AFA's founder, Don Wildmon, was ""instrumental"" in initially setting up the [[Arlington Group , a networking vehicle for social conservatives focusing on gay marriage.<ref name=stonevaida/>  ===One Million Moms/One Million Dads project=== AFA created One Million Moms and One Million Dads, two websites with the stated goal of mobilizing parents to ""stop the exploitation of children"" by the media. It uses these websites to organize boycotts and urge activists to send emails to mainstream companies employing advertising, selling products, or advertising on television shows they find offensive. In 2012, the group started and then backed off from a failed campaign against the hiring of talk show host [[Ellen DeGeneres  as a spokesperson for department store chain [[JC Penney . They opposed her employment on the grounds that DeGeneres is ""an open homosexual"".  At a taping of her show, DeGeneres informed her audience of the fizzled effort: ""They wanted to get me fired and I am proud and happy to say JC Penney stuck by their decision to make me their spokesperson.""  The One Million Moms campaign expressed opposition to [[Marvel Comics|Marvel  and [[DC Comics  issues which featured gay characters, describing the storylines as a ""brainwashing and desensitizing experience"" for children, written to ""influence them in thinking that a gay lifestyle choice is normal and desirable.""  The organization has also criticized [[GEICO  for a commercial showing [[GEICO advertising campaigns#Maxwell the Pig|Maxwell the Pig  in a car with a human girl, saying it suggests bestiality.  In 2015, the organization criticized a Campbell's ad that depicted two dads taking care of their child by feeding him Campbell's Star Wars soup. The organization claimed the ad ""normaliz[ed] sin.""  ===In God We Trust=== [[File:In God We Trust AFA Poster in New Philadelphia High School.jpg|thumb|A framed poster displaying the national motto of the United States in a [[New Philadelphia High School  classroom  After the [[September 11 attacks  in 2001, many public schools across the United States posted ""[[In God We Trust "" framed posters in their ""libraries, cafeterias and classrooms"". The American Family Association supplied several 11-by-14-inch posters to school systems and vowed to defend any legal challenges to the displaying of the posters.  == Criticism and controversy == In 2015, the organisation officially repudiated  views of former director of issues analysis [[Bryan Fischer , including the claim that black people ""rut like rabbits""; that the First Amendment applies only to Christians; that Hispanics are ""socialists by nature"" and come to the U.S. to ""plunder"" the country; that [[Hillary Clinton  is a [[lesbian , and that ""Homosexuality gave us [[Adolf Hitler , and homosexuals in the military gave us the [[Brown Shirts , the Nazi war machine and six million dead Jews.""<ref name=rwwrepudiate></ref>  ===Religious exercise=== Sandy Rios, the Family Association's director of governmental affairs, has criticised ""powerful Jewish forces behind the [[ACLU "" and stated that secular Jews often ""turn out to be the worst enemies of the country"" while the AFA's president Tim Wildmon stated ""Most of the Jews in this country, unfortunately, are far-left.""  Bryan Fischer, former director of issues analysis, has described Muslims as ""Parasites Who Must Convert or Die"" and stated that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution  protects only the religious practice of Christianity, writing in a blog post ""The real object of the amendment was, not to countenance, much less to advance Mahometanism, or Judaism, or infidelity, by prostrating Christianity; but to exclude all rivalry among Christian sects... So the purpose of the First Amendment was most decidedly NOT to ""approve, support,  or  accept"" any ""religion"" other than Christianity."" Fischer has suggested Jews and Muslims are not included in religious freedom protections in the US, saying: ""I have contended for years that the First Amendment, as given by the Founders, provides religious liberty protections for Christianity only."" He later wrote: ""We are a Christian nation and not a Jewish or Muslim one.""  In a 2015 press release denouncing Fischer's views, the AFA stated ""AFA rejects the idea expressed by Bryan Fischer that ""Free exercise of religion"" only applies to Christians. Consequently, AFA rejects Bryan's assertions that Muslims should not be granted permits to build mosques in the United States.""<ref name=""rwwrepudiate""/>  === Stance on homosexuality === The AFA has been criticized by a number of organizations for their stance against [[LGBT rights|gay rights .<ref name=""sovo""/><ref name=CNET/>  ====Homosexuality and Nazism==== Former AFA California leader [[Scott Lively <ref name=""sovo"" /> is a co-author of ''[[The Pink Swastika ''  1995 , in which he claims that all of the major leaders in the [[Nazi  regime were homosexual, a claim which is widely rejected by most historians. He has since co-founded [[Watchmen on the Walls . In 2007, Bryan Fischer, former Director of Issues Analysis for the AFA, hosted Scott Lively at an event promoting the message that ""homosexuality was at the heart of Nazism"".<ref name=bully></ref>  In May 2010, Fischer wrote a blog post on the AFA website<ref name=""blog""></ref> and [[RenewAmerica  detailing purported allegations that [[Sexuality of Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler was a homosexual , that ""the Nazi Party began in a gay bar in Munich,""<ref name=""James Withers""></ref>  and concluded by claiming that the [[Holocaust   which actually included [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|gay victims of Nazi persecution   was caused by homosexuals in the Nazi German military: ""Nazi Germany became the horror that it was because it rejected both Christianity and its clear teaching about human sexuality.""<ref name=""blog""/> On American Family Talk radio, Fischer repeated the claim that Hitler was a homosexual, and stated that Hitler recruited homosexuals to be stormtroopers, because ""homosexual soldiers basically had no limits and the savagery and brutality they were willing to inflict.""  In 2013 Fischer claimed that ""Homofascists"" will treat Christians like Jews in the Holocaust and later that year he repeated on American Family Talk that Hitler started the Nazi party ""in a gay bar in Munich""<ref name=""James Withers""/> and that ""[Adolf Hitler] couldn't get straights to be vicious enough in being his enforcers.""  The [[Southern Poverty Law Center , through its Teaching Tolerance program, has encouraged schools across the U.S. to hold a ""Mix It Up at Lunch"" day in order to encourage students to break up cliques and prevent bullying. In late 2012, the AFA called the project – begun 11 years earlier and held in more than 2,500 schools – ""a nationwide push to promote the homosexual lifestyle in public schools"", urging parents to keep their children home from school on October 30, 2012, and to call the schools to protest the event. ""I was surprised that they completely lied about what Mix It Up Day is"", Maureen Costello, the director of the center's Teaching Tolerance project, which organizes the program, told ''The New York Times''. ""It was a cynical, fear-mongering tactic."" In October, Bryan Fischer was taken off air during a CNN interview with Carol Costello for repeating his belief that ""Hitler recruited homosexuals around him to make up his Stormtroopers.""  In 2012, as jury selection was to begin in a trial on [[Miller v. Jenkins#Parental kidnapping investigation|charges of kidnapping  of a lesbian couple's daughter, Fischer wrote on Twitter in support of kidnapping of children from same-sex households and smuggling them to what he calls ""normal"" homes.<ref name=CBS></ref><ref name=RawStoF>Edwards, David  August 8, 2012 . [http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/08/08/fischer-calls-for-underground-railroad-to-kidnap-children-of-lgbt-parents/ ""Fischer calls for 'Underground Railroad’ to kidnap children of LGBT parents""]. ''The Raw Story''. Retrieved August 9, 2012.</ref> Fischer also reiterated his views on his radio show, and on video.<ref name=CBS/><ref name=RawStoF/> In January 2013, he compared consensual sex between people of the same gender to pedophilia, [[incest  and [[bestiality . In January 2013, Fischer compared the [[Boy Scouts of America 's change in views on gay scouts and scoutmasters to [[Jerry Sandusky , saying allowing gay scoutmasters was inviting pedophiles into the tents of children. In March 2013, Fischer compared homosexuality to bank robbery when [[Rob Portman|Senator Portman  announced his views on [[same-sex marriage  had changed due to having a gay son.<ref name=IA></ref> Fischer also stated that homosexuality should be banned like trans fats for being ""a hazard to human health"" and likened homosexuals to thieves, murderers and child molesters.  On January 28, 2015, Tim Wildmon, president of the American Family Association, demoted Fischer from being a spokesperson. Fischer went on to state that he will still be hosting the AFA's American Family Talk radio. In order to avoid being categorised as a hate group by Israel, the AFA issued a press release denouncing some of Fischer's views, rejecting his claim that Hillary Clinton is a lesbian, and stating: ""AFA rejects the statement by Bryan Fischer that, 'Homosexuality gave us Adolf Hitler, and homosexuals in the military gave us the Brown Shirts, the Nazi war machine and six million dead Jews.' AFA rejects the policy advocated by Bryan Fischer that homosexual conduct should be illegal. AFA rejects the notion advocated by Bryan Fischer that, 'We need an underground railroad to protect innocent children from same-sex households.'""<ref name=rwwrepudiate/>  ====Criticism of homosexuality==== In 1998, the [[Content-control software|Internet filtering software  [[SurfControl|CyberPatrol  blocked the AFA's web site, classifying it under the category ""intolerance"", defined as ""pictures or text advocating prejudice or discrimination against any race, color, national origin, religion, disability or handicap, gender or sexual orientation..."" AFA spokesman Steve Ensley told reporters, ""Basically we're being blocked for free speech."" CyberPatrol cited quotes from the AFA for meeting its intolerance criteria, which included: ""Indifference or neutrality toward the homosexual rights movement will result in society's destruction by allowing civil order to be redefined and by plummeting ourselves, our children, and grandchildren into an age of godlessness""; ""A national 'Coming Out of Homosexuality' provides us a means whereby to dispel the lies of the homosexual rights crowd who say they are born that way and cannot change""; and ""We want to outlaw public homosexuality...We believe homosexuality is immoral and leads ultimately to personal and social decay.""<ref name=""ALA1"" /><ref name=""vanderkam"" /><ref name=""CNET""></ref>  On October 19, 1998, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, led by Leslie Katz, wrote a letter to the AFA in response to an advertisement placed in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle '' by the AFA regarding homosexuality and Christianity. The letter stated:<ref name=AFAvSF></ref>  <blockquote>Supervisor Leslie Katz denounces your rhetoric against gays, lesbians and transgendered people. What happened to [[Matthew Shepard  is in part due to the message being espoused by your groups that gays and lesbians are not worthy of the most basic equal rights and treatment. It is not an exaggeration to say that there is a direct correlation between these acts of discrimination, such as when gays and lesbians are called sinful and when major religious organizations say they can change if they tried, and the horrible crimes committed against gays and lesbians.</blockquote>  During the same time, the [[San Francisco, California|City and County of San Francisco  passed two resolutions. Resolution No. 234-99 ""calls for the Religious Right to take accountability for the impact of their long-standing rhetoric denouncing gays and lesbians, which leads to a climate of mistrust and discrimination that can open the door to horrible crimes such as those committed against [[Equality Alabama#Gaither|Mr. Gaither "" and Resolution No. 873-98 was specifically directed at ""anti-gay"" television advertisements. AFA unsuccessfully challenged these actions as violating the Free Speech and Free Exercise clauses of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment  in ''[[American Family Association v. City and County of San Francisco ''.<ref name=AFAvSF/>  In 1998, multiple organizations voiced criticism of a series of AFA-sponsored full-page newspaper advertisements that promoted religious ministries involved in the [[ex-gay  movement. In response to the advertisements, the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|Religious Leadership Roundtable  said the ads employed ""language of violence and hatred to denounce other people"". [[IntegrityUSA  criticized the ads, calling them ""evil"" disregarding Christian teachings about the ""dignity of every human being"". [[DignityUSA  also criticized the advertisements, which they said were ""misleading and destructive"".  In July 2000, the AFA sent out emails and letters calling for [[Coming out|openly gay  [[Arizona  [[Republican Party  United States |Republican  [[United States House of Representatives  member [[Jim Kolbe  to be barred from speaking at the Republican National Convention. The AFA also said that Kolbe should be arrested when he returned to his home state, as because Kolbe is gay, he was violating an Arizona [[Sodomy law|law that banned sodomy . [[Equality Mississippi , a statewide [[LGBT social movements|LGBT civil rights  organization which has voiced opposition and criticism towards the AFA's activism regarding homosexuality, felt that AFA's action was constituting and encouraging violence towards the [[gay community .  In 2005, Equality Mississippi publicly spoke out against the AFA for the use of copyrighted images on the AFA web site in its boycott against [[Kraft Foods  for being a sponsor of the 2006 [[Gay Games  in Chicago. The photographs, which were used without permission, were owned by and retrieved from ChrisGeary.com. Equality Mississippi encouraged ChrisGeary.com to file suit against the AFA and offered to support the suit.<ref name=""Equality Mississippi 3""></ref> , the images were still on AFA's web site.  In June 2008, AFA's news website, ''OneNewsNow''&nbsp;– which had begun replacing all instances of ""gay"" with ""homosexual"" in re-posted [[Associated Press  articles&nbsp;– changed an AP profile of Olympic sprinter [[Tyson Gay , rendering his name as ""[[Tyson Homosexual "". ''OneNewsNow'' similarly altered the name of basketball player [[Rudy Gay , naming him ""Rudy Homosexual"". The [[gay rights  website GoodAsYou.org, which ""has long chronicled the AFA's practice of changing AP copy to suit its conservative agenda"", spotted the errors. Tyson Gay was upset with the mistake.  === Intellectual freedom ===  Individuals in the media industry have criticized Donald Wildmon, the founder of AFA. Gene Mater, senior vice president of [[CBS|CBS Television , has stated, ""We look upon Wildmon's efforts as the greatest frontal assault on intellectual freedom this country has ever faced"" and [[Brandon Tartikoff , then [[NBC|NBC Entertainment  President, stated that Wildmon's boycott campaign was ""the first step toward a police state.""  === Marilyn Manson ===   [[Paul Cambria , lawyer for rock band [[Marilyn Manson  band |Marilyn Manson , sent a [[cease and desist  letter to AFA on April 25, 1997 in response to allegations published in the ''AFA Journal'' that Manson encouraged audience members to engage in sexual and violent acts in its concerts. ''AFA Journal'' relied on testimony by two anonymous claimed teenage concertgoers. The allegations were independently proven to be false. Wildmon responded that his organization as a whole was not responsible, but rather the AFA's Gulf Coast chapter in [[Biloxi, Mississippi .  ===Hate group listing=== The [[Southern Poverty Law Center , in a 2005 report, stated that the AFA, along with other groups, engaged in [[hate speech  to ""help drive the religious right's anti-gay crusade.""<ref name=Hall2005></ref> Mark Potok of the SPLC determined that the turning point was 2003's ''[[Lawrence v. Texas '', in which the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court  struck down Texas's anti-sodomy laws. After that, the Christian right spent millions on advertisements,<ref name=Hall2005/> and on pastor briefings organized by activists such as ""born-again"" Christian [[David Lane  activist |David Lane .<ref name=Besen2011></ref> Lane helped AFA put constitutional opposite-sex marriage amendments on the ballots of 13 states.<ref name=Hall2005/>  In November 2010, the SPLC changed their listing of AFA from a group that used hate speech to the more serious one of being designated a [[hate group .<ref name=SPLC></ref> Potok said that the AFA's ""propagation of known falsehoods and demonizing propaganda"" was the basis for the change.  The AFA was greatly displeased with the designation as a hate group, calling the list ""slanderous"".<ref name=Rayfield2010></ref> In response to the SPLC's announcement, some members of the Christian right ""called on Congress to cut off their funding."" J. Matt Barber of ''[[The Washington Times '' said that the SPLC was ""marginalizing"" themselves by giving the AFA the same hate group designation shared by the [[Ku Klux Klan  and [[neo-Nazi s. [[Tony Perkins  politician |Tony Perkins , the president of [[Family Research Council   FRC &nbsp;– an organization also named a hate group&nbsp;– asked the SPLC to strike the new designation, but they held their position. Ken Williams commented that in reaction, the FRC and the AFA joined with other ""pro-family"" organizations targeted by the SPLC to establish a new website, an online petition called ""Start Debating/Stop Hating"" to counter the SPLC,<ref name=StartDebating></ref> and they took out full page ads in two Washington D.C. newspapers, defending their work ""to protect and promote natural marriage and the family.""<ref name=""SPLC Responds""></ref> The advertisement stated the ""undersigned stand in solidarity"" with the organizations designated as hate groups, and that they ""support the vigorous but responsible exercise of the First Amendment rights of free speech and religious liberty that are the birthright of all Americans.""<ref name=StartDebating/> House Speaker-Designate [[John Boehner  and the governors of Louisiana, Minnesota and Virginia were among those signing the statement.<ref name=""SPLC Responds""/> The SPLC addressed the new website statement; Potok was quoted by David Weigel of [[Slate  magazine |''Slate''  magazine as saying, ""the SPLC's listings of these groups is based on their propagation of known falsehoods&nbsp;– claims about LGBT people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities&nbsp;– and repeated, groundless name-calling."" The [[American Independent News Network   AINN  noted that the AFA had recently denounced Supreme Court justice [[Elena Kagan  as a lesbian unfit for office&nbsp;– AINN stated that ""she's not"" a lesbian&nbsp;– and that Fischer said Hitler's savage and brutal methods were only possible because he and most of his stormtroopers were gay. Jillian Rayfield of ''[[Talking Points Memo '' noted the irony in the website calling the SPLC a ""radical Left"" group ""spreading hateful rhetoric"" yet elsewhere declaring that the debates of the Christian right ""can and must remain civil&nbsp;– but they must never be suppressed through personal assaults that aim only to malign an opponent's character.""<ref name=Rayfield2010/>  == See also ==  *[[Christian right  *[[Christian fundamentalism  *[[Radical right  United States   * [[New Right  * [[Abiding Truth Ministries  * [[Culture War  * [[Religion and homosexuality  * [[List of organizations designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as anti-gay hate groups   ==References==   ==Further reading== *  ==External links== * [http://www.afa.net/ American Family Association] official site *[http://purl.oclc.org/umarchives/MUM00008/ American Family Association Collection  MUM00008 ] owned by the University of Mississippi, Archives and Special Collections.

The paper was pledged to ""impartiality, firmness and independence"". After the abolition of newspaper [[stamp tax  in Scotland in 1855, ''The Scotsman'' was relaunched as a daily newspaper priced at [[£sd|1d  and a circulation of 6,000 copies.  The fledgling paper was originally based at 257 High Street on the [[Royal Mile .  In 1860, The Scotsman obtained a purpose built office on [[Cockburn Street  in [[Edinburgh  designed in the [[Scots baronial  style by the architects [[Peddie & Kinnear . This backed onto their original offices on the Royal Mile. The building bears the initials ""JR"" for [[John Ritchie  newspaper owner |John Ritchie  the founder of the company. On 19 December 1904, they moved to huge new offices at the top of the street, facing onto North Bridge, designed by [[Dunn & Findlay   Findlay being the son of the then owner . This huge building had taken three years to build and also had connected printworks on Market Street  now the City Art Centre . The printworks connected below road level direct to [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Waverley station  in a highly efficient production line.  In 1953 the newspaper was bought by Canadian millionaire [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson  who was in the process of building a large media group.  The paper was bought in 1995 by [[David and Frederick Barclay  for £85&nbsp;million. They moved the newspaper from its Edinburgh office on [[North Bridge, Edinburgh|North Bridge , which is now an [[The Scotsman Hotel|upmarket hotel , to modern offices in Holyrood Road designed by Edinburgh architects CDA, near the subsequent location of the [[Scottish Parliament Building . The daily was awarded by the [[Society for News Design   SND  the World’s Best Designed Newspaper™ for 1994.  In December 2005, ''The Scotsman'' was acquired, in a £160million deal, by [[Johnston Press , a company founded in Scotland and at the time one of the top three largest local newspaper publishers in the UK.  Ian Stewart has been the editor since June 2012, after a reshuffle of senior management in April 2012 during which [[John McLellan  journalist |John McLellan  who was the paper's editor-in-chief was dismissed.  Ian Stewart was previously editor of ''[[Edinburgh Evening News '' and remains as the editor of ''[[Scotland on Sunday ''.  In 2012, ''The Scotsman'' was named Newspaper of the Year at the Scottish Press Awards.  In 2006 Barclay Brothers sold Barclay House to Irish property magnate Lochlann Quinn, and in 2013 Scottish video games maker [[Rockstar North , of Grand Theft Auto fame, signed the lease, causing Johnston Press group to move out in June 2014. Johnston Press have downsized to refurbished premises at Orchard Brae House in Queensferry Road, Edinburgh, a move which was quoted as saving the group £1million per annum in rent.  The newspaper backed a 'No' vote in the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on Scottish independence .

Fortunately for the principle of free speech, Google did not capitulate to this particular demand ... Forced to act on its own initiative, Remove Jew Watch successfully used Googlebombing ... Better still would have been either a proper contest of ideas between Jew Watch and Remove Jew Watch, or alternatively a decision that Jew Watch was beneath contempt and should simply be ignored.

As of February 2018, the magazine's editor-in-chief is Ellis Jones.  ==History== Founded by [[Suroosh Alvi , [[Gavin McInnes  and [[Shane Smith  journalist |Shane Smith ,<ref name=""Rob""></ref> the magazine was launched in 1994 as the ''Voice of Montreal'' with government funding, and the intention of the founders was to provide work and a community service.<ref name=gua/> When the editors later sought to dissolve their commitments with the original publisher Alix Laurent, they bought him out and changed the name to ''Vice'' in 1996.<ref name=""smith""/>  Richard Szalwinski, a Canadian software millionaire, acquired the magazine and relocated the operation to New York City in the late 1990s. Following the relocation, the magazine quickly developed a reputation for provocative and [[politically incorrect  content. Under Szalwinski's ownership, a few retail stores were opened in New York City and customers could purchase fashion items that were advertised in the magazine. However, due to the end of the [[dot-com bubble , the three founders eventually regained ownership of the Vice brand, followed by the closure of the stores.<ref name=""Rob"" />  The British edition of ''Vice'' was launched in 2002 and [[Andy Capper  was its first editor. Capper explained in an interview shortly after the UK debut that the publication's remit was to cover ""the things we're meant to be ashamed of"", and articles were published on topics such as [[bukkake  and bodily functions.<ref name=""Pug""></ref>  By the end of 2007, 13 foreign editions of ''Vice'' magazine were published, the Vice independent record label was functional, and the online video channel VBS.com had 184,000 unique viewers from the U.S. during the month of August. The media company was still based in New York City, but the magazine began featuring articles on topics that were considered more serious, such as armed conflict in Iraq, than previous content. Alvi explained to ''[[The New York Times '' in November 2007: ""The world is much bigger than the Lower East Side and the East Village.""<ref name=""Rob"" />  McInnes left the publication in 2008, citing ""creative differences"" as the primary issue. In an email communication dated 23 January, McInnes explained: ""I no longer have anything to do with Vice or VBS or DOs & DON'Ts or any of that. It's a long story but we've all agreed to leave it at 'creative differences,' so please don't ask me about it.""  At the commencement of 2012, an article in ''Forbes'' magazine referred to the Vice company as ""Vice Media"", but the precise time when this title development occurred is not public knowledge. Vice acquired the fashion magazine ''[[i-D '' in December 2012 and, by February 2013, Vice produced 24 global editions of the magazine, with a global circulation of 1,147,000  100,000 in the UK . By this stage, Alex Miller had replaced Capper as the editor-in-chief of the UK edition. Furthermore, Vice consisted of 800 worldwide employees, including 100 in London, and around 3,500 freelancers also produced content for the company.<ref name=""Pug"" />  ==Staff==  *[[Shane Smith  journalist |Shane Smith  – Co-Founder *[[Suroosh Alvi  – Co-Founder *Ellis Jones – Editor-in-Chief   ==Content== ===Scope=== ''Vice'' magazine includes the work of journalists, columnists, fiction writers, graphic artists and cartoonists, and photographers. Both ''Vice''s online and magazine content has shifted from dealing mostly with independent arts and [[pop culture|pop cultural  matters to covering more serious news topics. Due to the large array of contributors and the fact that often writers will only submit a small number of articles with the publication, ''Vice''s content varies dramatically and its political and cultural stance is often unclear or contradictory. Articles on the site feature a range of subjects, often things not covered as by mainstream media. The magazine's editors have championed the [[Immersion journalism|immersionist school of journalism , which has been passed to other properties of Vice Media such as the documentary television show [[Balls Deep  TV Series |''Balls Deep''  on the [[Viceland  Channel. This style of journalism is regarded as something of a DIY antithesis to the methods practiced by mainstream news outlets, and has published an entire issue of articles written in accordance with this ethos. Entire issues of the magazine have also been dedicated to the concerns of [[Iraqi people ,<ref name=""iraqissue""/> [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans ,<ref name=""nativeissue""/> [[Russian people ,<ref name=""ru""/> people with [[mental disorders ,<ref name=""ill""/> and people with [[mental disabilities .<ref name=""special""/> ''Vice'' also publishes an annual guide for students in the [[United Kingdom .<ref name=""student""/>  In 2007, a ''Vice'' announcement was published on the Internet: <blockquote>After umpteen years of putting out what amounted to a reference book every month, we started to get bored with it. Besides, too many other magazines have ripped it and started doing their own lame take on themes. So we're going to do some issues, starting now, that have whatever we feel like putting in them.<ref name=""dearreaders"" /></blockquote>  ===Politics=== In a March 2008 interview with ''[[The Guardian '', Smith was asked about the magazine's political allegiances and he stated, ""We're not trying to say anything politically in a paradigmatic left/right way ...

browser, desktop app, streaming devices, game consoles, smartphones     '''Sky News''' is a British news organisation, which operates a TV network of the same name, a radio news service, and distributes news through online channels. It is owned by [[Sky Limited|Sky , a division of [[Comcast . [[John Ryley  is the Head of Sky News, a role he has held since June 2006. Sky News is currently [[Royal Television Society  News Channel of the Year, the eleventh time it has held the award.  A sister channel, [[Sky News Arabia , is operated as a joint venture with the Abu Dhabi Media Investment Corporation. Another sister channel, [[Sky News Australia , was part owned by Sky News parent Sky plc until December 2016. A channel called Sky News International, simulcasting the UK channel directly but without British adverts, is available in Europe, Middle East, Africa, South Asia, Asia Pacific, Australia and the Americas. Narrated segments  which generally cover lighter issues unrelated to current news stories  are played in lieu of adverts, and there are also international weather forecasts at the end of each half-hour newswheel. Sponsored adverts are still broadcast before and/or after the sports news and weather segments. [[Sky News Radio  provides national and international news to [[commercial radio  and [[community radio  stations in the UK and to other English-language stations around the world. Sky News also provides content to [[Yahoo! News . The channel is available on [[Apple TV , [[Amazon Fire TV , [[Roku , [[YouTube , and [[Pluto TV .  ==History== ===Establishment and early years=== On 8 June 1988, [[Rupert Murdoch  announced plans to start a new television news service in a speech to the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|British Academy of Film and Television Arts  Bafta  . Sky News started broadcasting at 6&nbsp;pm on 5 February 1989.    In the early days, the channel operated on a £40&nbsp;million budget  plus £10&nbsp;million share of overheads , which led [[Sam Chisholm , chief executive of the newly merged BSkyB to suggest to Murdoch that the station to be closed, but Rupert was ""pleased with its achievements ... there were overriding reasons of prestige and politics for keeping it ... the final hurdle of the Broadcasting Bill had still to be overcome and the case for the acceptability of Sky would collapse if suddenly there was no news channel."" – former deputy Prime Minister [[William Whitelaw, 1st Viscount Whitelaw|William Whitelaw  said in the House of Lords in 1990 that Sky News had ""a very high reputation ... I admire it, as do many other people, it will certainly waken up both the BBC and ITN and ensure that they compete with what is a very important news service"". The channel has never been run for a profit, and has considered using ITN to supplement the service.  By March 1992, Sky News' parent company turned from loss to profit.<ref name=""newsjournalisminuk""></ref> On the channel's growth, Murdoch said at that time: ""Sky News, has quietly, if expensively, become the first building block of what we envision will become the premier worldwide electronic news-gathering network anywhere. Ask anyone in Europe, and particularly the BBC and you will be told that Sky News has added a new and better dimension to television journalism.""  Sky News was the UK's first 24-hour news channel, broadcast on [[Astra 1A . It had no local competition until November 1997 when [[BBC News  launched a new 24-hour channel, BBC News 24, now known simply as [[BBC News  TV channel |BBC News . In September 1999 the [[European Commission  ruled against a Sky News complaint which argued that the publicly funded BBC News 24 was unfair and illegal under [[European Union|EU  law. The EC ruled that the [[television licence fee  ''should'' be considered state aid  within the meaning of Article 87  but that the BBC's public service remit justified the channel.  ===Sky News since 2000=== [[File:Sky News 2015 Logo.svg|right|thumb|Former Sky News logo used until 2018   In March 2000 '''Sky News Active''' was launched, a 24-hour interactive service providing headlines  and other services which ranged from weather, the top story of the day and showbiz  on demand.  In March 2004 it was announced that Sky News had won a five-year contract to supply news bulletins to [[Channel 5  UK |Channel 5 , taking over from [[ITN  in January 2005.  On 24 October 2005, Sky News moved to new studios in [[Isleworth , London, and underwent a major on-screen revamp. The new studio was integrated with the newsroom and boasted the biggest video wall in Britain; it was designed by New York architects [[Janson Design Group .<ref name=""guardian.co.uk""></ref> New music was scored by Adelphoi Music and recorded with a full orchestra at Air Studios, [[Hampstead , and mastered at Metropolis Studios. New on-screen graphics were launched and the channel began broadcasting in [[widescreen   [[16:9   format.  The 2005 relaunch also saw the introduction of a new schedule designed around ""appointment to view"" programmes rather than continuous rolling news.<ref name=""guardian.co.uk""/> [[James Rubin  joined to present a new evening programme called ''World News Tonight'', [[Julie Etchingham  presented another new ""hard-hitting"" evening show called ''[[The Sky Report '', [[Eamonn Holmes  joined to present ''[[Sky News Sunrise|Sunrise '', [[Kay Burley  presented a new programme called ''[[Lunchtime Live '' from 12 to 2&nbsp;pm, and the daytime show ''[[Sky News Today '' saw the introduction of a three-presenter format. However, the relaunched schedule was unsuccessful, and from October 2005 the [[BBC  News channel overtook Sky News in the ratings.  In response to the schedule's unpopularity with viewers, changes took place in July 2006, involving the removal of the evening programmes replaced by rolling news and an interactive programme, ''[[Sky News with Martin Stanford '', and the return to a two-presenter format on ''Sky News Today''. These changes came at the time of the arrival of John Ryley, who is still the head of Sky News.  On 1 October 2007 Sky introduced another new schedule, extending Kay Burley's ''Lunchtime Live'' programme and renaming it ''Afternoon Live''. It also switched to a new format for much of the day, with a solo lead presenter and a summary newsreader. Sky News put more emphasis on interactive news with [[Martin Stanford 's new ''[[SkyNews.com '' programme; an early evening financial news programme presented by [[Jeff Randall  journalist |Jeff Randall , was also introduced, initially on Mondays only.  Further changes were made to the Sky News schedule on 8 September 2008, with [[Colin Brazier  presenting a new show from 1&nbsp;pm – 2&nbsp;pm, ''[[The Live Desk  Sky |The Live Desk '', and Martin Stanford's ''Sky.com News'' became ''SkyNews.com'', moving to 7&nbsp;pm every weeknight.  More changes took place during the early part of 2009. These changes involved major changes to the layout of the newsroom/studio, the introduction of a morning edition of ''The Live Desk'' and the extension of the financial news programme ''[[Jeff Randall Live '' to run for four nights each week, Monday to Thursday.  From 6&nbsp;am to midnight on 8 March 2010, Sky News was presented and produced exclusively by women to mark [[International Women's Day . This exercise was repeated in 2011 and 2012.  In preparation for the start of high-definition broadcasting, Sky News moved to its second studio  Studio B  on the morning of 30 March 2010. Broadcasting from Studio B continued until 9&nbsp;pm on 6 May, when it moved back to the main newsroom and launched Sky News HD in time for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election  results. Sky News received a graphics refresh and a new logo to coincide with the launch of the new HD channel – this was tried out during the soft launch for Sky News HD on 22 April; Sky News' distinctive orchestral theme music, in use since 2005, was also replaced on 6 May 2010.  The new title music, composed by [[David Arnold  conductor |David Arnold , was recorded with a 60-piece [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra  in [[Angel Recording Studios , London and uses more than 132 [[audio channel s for 18 seconds of sound.  Following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 General Election , Sky News was rebranded, with a new top-of-the-hour sequence and on-screen graphics. The traditional opening voiceover, read by Bruce Hammal, was dropped after two decades in use.  On 24 October 2016, Sky News began broadcasting from a new studio  Studio 21  at ''Sky Central'', Sky's new headquarters in West London. The ""glass box"" studio is used for broadcasts from 6&nbsp;am to 6.30&nbsp;pm each weekday  with the exception of All Out Politics, which comes from Sky's Westminster studio . The schedule was also changed.  In January 2017, Sky moved its business operations into [[The News Building  London |the News Building  in central London.  On 16 January 2018, Sky moved all its news operations over to Studio 21 ""the glass box"", and a new studio in Sky Studios. The logo was also refreshed along with the graphics.  On 3 April 2018, [[21st Century Fox  made two proposals regarding the Sky acquisition: They would either sell Sky News to [[The Walt Disney Company   which would be a separate transaction from the Disney-Fox merger , or to separate Sky News from Sky plc.  On June 19, 2018, it was reported that Disney has agreed to acquire Sky News. However, [[Comcast  won the bidding war over the stake for £17.28 per-share, thus alligning Sky News with its [[NBC  division of its wholly owned subsidiary [[NBCUniversal . Sky plc had until 11 October to formally accept this offer.<ref name=""variety-openmarket""></ref> On 12 October 2018, Comcast announced it will compulsorily acquire the rest of Sky after its bid gained acceptances from 95.3% of the broadcaster's shareholders and later Comcast acquired the rest of 5% of the shares of the Sky.  ==Reception==  Sky News is [[free-to-air  on the [[Astra 28.2°E  satellites carrying [[Sky UK|Sky . It is also available on [[Freeview  UK |Freeview  and analogue and digital cable. In 2007 BSkyB announced its intention to cease broadcasting Sky News as well as other BSkyB channels over Freeview pending [[Ofcom  approval.  ===Sky News International===  Sky News is also available internationally on cable systems, on satellite and in some hotels. While the UK feed is broadcast in 16:9, the international version remained broadcast in a 4:3 picture format until August 2010.  The international version is shown as free-to-air on [[Astra  satellite |Astra 1L  at 19.2° east. It is also carried encrypted on a number of satellites for international reception–including but not limited to [[Hot Bird , [[Nilesat , Amos 1 and [[Intelsat  10-02. It is also usually carried on cable systems in Europe, particularly  but not only  in Northern Europe, especially in the Scandinavian countries.  International viewers receive the same programming line-up of Sky News as the UK version. Brief news stories, entertainment news, worldwide weather forecast summaries, and the front pages of international newspapers are broadcast in lieu of commercials.  The timepiece on the lower left-hand side of the ticker is covered with a banner that says 'skynews.com'.  Sky News is not available on [[Sky Deutschland , Sky plc's offering in Germany but is available on [[Sky Italia .  On 19 June 2013 Sky News International was added to [[Apple TV  for users in the UK, Ireland and United States. Viewers can watch clips or live streaming of the channel at no charge. On 24 July 2013, it was added to the [[Roku  streaming player.  Sky News International is available on news.sky.com to viewers around the world. On 30 September 2014, Sky News began [[live stream ing the channel on [[YouTube . The free streaming service [[Pluto TV  also offers a live feed of Sky News to American users on channel 135.  ===Sister channels=== [[Sky News Australia  was one-third owned by Sky plc until December 2016, when it was acquired by [[News Corp Australia . It carries Sky News UK overnight and shares some of its presentational style. On [[Foxtel  in Australia, Sky News UK is available on Sky News Active.   From 2004 to 2006, [[Sky News Ireland  broadcast two newscasts produced in Dublin. The newscasts were cancelled due to low viewership. Sky News in Ireland now carries the same programming as Sky News in the UK but with local advertising.   [[Sky News Arabia , broadcasting in Arabic and headquartered in Abu Dhabi, UAE, launched in 2012. Sky plc owns 50% of the channel.    [[Sky TG24  is Italy's version of Sky News, launched in 2003.  ===Previous Partnership with CBS News=== Until 2017, Sky News had a resource-sharing agreement with [[CBS News  in the United States to share footage and reporting. In July 2017, in the wake of Sky's pending takeover by [[21st Century Fox   which runs the competing and ''de facto'' sister [[Fox News Channel  in the U.S. , and [[NBC News  acquiring a stake in [[Euronews , CBS ended the agreement and entered into a similar deal with the BBC.  ==Sky News HD==  [[File:Sky News HD 2015 Logo.png|thumb|Former Sky News HD logo  2015-2018    [[File:Sky News HD.png|thumb|Former Sky News HD logo  2010-15    Beginning in early 2008, Sky News began using HD-capable cameras in the field. Some one-off programmes were made available in HD to [[Sky+ HD  subscribers on [[On Demand  Sky |Sky On Demand . The programmes included ''Technofile'', ''Diana: The Final Word'', ''Canoe Man: Rise and Fall of John Darwin'' and ''Pathfinders: Into The Heart Of Afghanistan''.  On 20 January 2009, before the launch of the Sky News HD channel, [[Sky Arts  broadcast Sky News coverage in HD of the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|Inauguration of Barack Obama . [[Jeremy Thompson  fronted the coverage from Washington, D.C. [[Michael Jackson 's memorial service was also broadcast in HD, with Kay Burley presenting.  Sky News moved operations to a [[Chroma key|chroma-key  set in Studio B from 30 March 2010 so that final preparations for HD could take place in the main newsroom.  The first live broadcast of Sky News HD, on Sky Channel 517, was the channel's election debate which was held on 22 April 2010. For the 10 days leading up to the debate, channel 517 displayed a countdown clock to launch. The debate was hosted in HD by [[Kay Burley  and [[Adam Boulton . Following the end of the coverage for the evening, channel 517 moved to show a looping preview tape. The tape included the HD which were available on Sky Anytime. The loop continued until Sky News HD was launched on the evening of 6 May 2010, coinciding with the coverage of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election  results, hosted by Adam Boulton.  On 26 July 2010, Sky News HD launched on the [[OSN  Network, broadcasting to the Middle East and Africa.  On 1 January 2015, Sky News HD launched on Virgin Media.  ==Sky News Radio==  Sky News Radio provides news bulletins to [[radio station s in the United Kingdom and to other English-language radio stations around the world.  In March 2007, BSkyB and [[Chrysalis Group  announced plans to launch a dedicated Sky News Radio station on the proposed bid by [[Channel 4 's [[4 Digital Group  for the second [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB  [[DAB ensemble|multiplex  in the United Kingdom. However, two months later Chrysalis sold its radio stations to [[Global Radio , and in October 2007 following a business review Global's chief executive announced that it would be withdrawing from the joint venture.  The Sky News Radio feed is available [[free-to-air  on the Astra 2A satellite at 28.2 East by tuning it manually: 12207.00 V, 27500, 2/3  Label: SNR .  ==Sky News Raw== On 5 February 2019, Sky News launched a pop-up channel called ''Sky News Raw''. It aired with behind-the-scenes programming from 07:00 to 17:00 on channel 523 on Sky TV and online via Sky News' social media channels. The pop-up channel celebrated the 30th anniversary of Sky News, having first broadcast on the 5 February 1989.  Robotic cameras were placed around the newsroom and planning rooms at [[Sky Studios , in the three main television studios at Osterley and Millbank, and in the [[production control room|broadcast galleries . There were also behind-the-scenes features from elsewhere in the newsgathering operation, such as the Sky News helicopter and [[Electronic News Gathering|ENG  vehicles. <gallery mode=""packed"" widths=""180px"" class=""center""> File:Sky News Raw.jpg|Sky News Raw logo as used in January and February 2019 File:Sky News Helicopter  6905905008 .jpg|The Sky News Helicopter was featured on the channel File:Romeva a Sky News - ""Si el 'sí' guanya el referèndum, Catalunya serà un estat independent"".jpg|Cameras were also installed in the Millbank studios </gallery>  ==On-air staff==   ==In-depth series== The channel occasionally focuses on specific areas of society and current affairs. Past examples include ''Inside Iraq'', ''Green Britain'' and ''Crime Uncovered''.  ''Pakistan: On Terror's Frontline'' was shown throughout the week beginning Monday 23 March 2009. A Sky News press release stated:   The series of reports won a 2009 RTS Award for International News Coverage.  ==Criticism and perception== [[File:Sky News viewing share history.png|300px|thumb|Sky News viewing peaked during [[11 September attacks , [[Iraq War , [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Asian tsunami , [[7 July 2005 London bombings  and the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales  but has generally declined to a quarter achieved in 1992–95  Sky News operates under United Kingdom broadcasting regulations which require impartial, unbiased coverage and prevent the channel from being encrypted in the UK. The channel is viewed by some in the media establishment as an impartial and unbiased provider of news.<ref name=""The Independent 2012-5-28""></ref>  There are occasional claims<ref name=Hasan></ref><ref name=""Sweney""></ref><ref name=""Wollaston""></ref> that Sky News may be inherently biased due to the fact that it is majority-owned by 21st Century Fox; most of 21st Century Fox's  and News Corp, in which Rupert Murdoch also has an ownership interest  news outlets have an openly conservative or right-wing outlook. In a 2010 article in the ''[[New Statesman '', prominent journalist and broadcaster [[Mehdi Hasan  argued that ""in style and in substance, of course, it is nothing like the pro-war, pro-[[Republican Party  United States |Republican , pro-[[Sarah Palin|Palin  Fox News Channel... Sky News remains, as far as I can see, free of party political bias.""<ref name=Hasan />  Ofcom received complaints regarding the network's lack of neutrality ahead of the 2010 General Election, but these were not upheld.<ref name=""Sweney""/><ref name=""Wollaston""/>  In early 1994 [[Kelvin MacKenzie , former editor of ''[[The Sun  United Kingdom |The Sun '' newspaper, was appointed managing director of BSkyB, Sky News's parent company at the time. MacKenzie's proposed changes to Sky News led to clashes with CEO Sam Chisholm and the head of Sky News, Ian Frykberg, who protested at what they saw as an attempt to take the channel's news values downmarket. The most ferocious battle occurred when Mackenzie wanted Sky News to run an interview with [[Philip Antony Fyson Buck|Lady Bienvenida Buck . Frykberg refused to air the interview and resigned shortly afterwards. The interview was broadcast on [[Sky One .<ref name=""Live TV"" /> MacKenzie announced his resignation in August 1994,<ref name=""Live TV""></ref> but not before Sky News had transmitted live pictures of the freeway chase of [[OJ Simpson  white [[Ford Bronco|Bronco  on 17 June 1994 bringing US ''helicopter journalism'' to the UK.<ref name=""ldandb""></ref>  In 1997 Sky News broadcast live coverage of [[Louise Woodward 's trial, held in [[Boston , [[Massachusetts .<ref name=""autogenerated1""></ref> When Sky returned to a regular schedule, viewers demanded the trial coverage be continued.<ref name=""autogenerated1"" /> Sky News broadcast reaction from Woodward's home town of [[Elton, Cheshire , leading to criticism that the station had a pro-Louise Woodward stance.<ref name=""autogenerated1"" />  In November 2005 the then head of BBC News, [[Peter Horrocks , acknowledged that Sky News remained the first choice for ""key opinion formers"".  [[Ofcom  received 652 complaints regarding the network's neutrality after it hosted the second leaders' debate ahead of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election .<ref name=""Sweney""/>  Ofcom received 832 complaints about a May 2010 interview with electoral reformist David Babbs conducted by Sky News presenter [[Kay Burley . The interview led to Burley being heckled by protesters while reporting from Westminster, and further protest via a Twitter campaign.  Ofcom received 696 complaints relating to Sky News's then political editor [[Adam Boulton 's conduct during an interview with [[Alastair Campbell .  In 2014, Sky News journalist [[Colin Brazier  rifled through an MH17 victim's possessions on live TV. He picked up objects and briefly described what he had before putting them down and saying ""we shouldn't really be doing this I suppose, really"". 110 complaints were submitted to Ofcom. Sky News stated both Brazier ""and Sky News apologise profusely for any offence caused"".  Sky News was again embroiled in controversy in October 2014, when crime correspondent [[Martin Brunt  and his camera crew doorstepped Brenda Leyland, who had posted controversial comments concerning the [[Disappearance of Madeleine McCann|McCann investigation  on [[social media . Following the confrontation Leyland was found dead in a hotel, leading to calls on social media for Brunt to be sacked. During the inquest into Leyland's death, Brunt expressed to the coroner that he was devastated at hearing the news of Leyland's suicide. Following the inquest, [[Ofcom  reported it had received 171 complaints in relation to the case and that it would consider these complaints in light of the coroner's verdict.  In 2015, Kay Burley caused further controversy when, in response to the [[November 2015 Paris attacks , she [[Twitter|tweeted  a photograph of a [[Golden Retriever  dog, to which she had added, ""Sadness in his eyes #parisattacks"".<ref name=""dog""></ref><ref name=""sad""></ref>  ==Fabrication== In April 2003, Sky News carried a report from James Forlong aboard the [[United Kingdom|British  nuclear [[submarine  [[HMS Splendid|HMS ''Splendid''  purportedly showing a live firing of a cruise missile during the Iraq war. The report was a fabrication, with the crew acting along for the benefit of the cameras. The ''Sky News'' team did not accompany the submarine when it left port and the scenes were actually recorded whilst the vessel was docked. The shot of the missile launch had been obtained from stock footage.  The faked report was revealed because another film crew did accompany the vessel to sea, and its footage showed that a modern missile is not launched by a crew member pressing a red button marked with the word ""FIRE"", as had been portrayed in the Sky News report, but is actually launched with a left mouse click. When the fabrication was exposed, Forlong and his producer were suspended. The next day, ''[[The Guardian '' reported that Forlong had resigned following an internal investigation. In a follow-up article, ''The Guardian'' speculated on the long-term effects on Sky News credibility. In October 2003, Forlong was found dead by his wife after committing suicide. In December, Sky News was fined £50,000 by the [[Independent Television Commission  for breaching accuracy regulations.  In August 2016 Sky News was criticised after allegedly paying €2,000 to a group of Romanians to pretend they were part of an eastern European gang selling guns to terrorists in Syria. The Romanians were arrested by Romanian [[DIICOT  and confessed that they were paid by Sky News journalist [[Stuart Ramsay  to pretend they were gun traffickers. The guns featured in the report were legally owned and were hunting weapons. Sky News has said it stands by the story.  ==Legal cases== * November 2008 – BSkyB paid substantial undisclosed libel damages to [[Robert Murat  in relation to their reporting of the abduction of [[Madeleine McCann . Sky News had falsely suggested that Murat, who was assisting in the search of McCann, had acted like child murderer [[Ian Huntley  following McCann's disappearance. Sky News also falsely accused Murat of misleading journalists into thinking he was working for the police. An apology was also placed on the Sky News website, the libellous material removed and Murat's costs were paid. * November 2010 – the [[Attorney General for England and Wales , [[Dominic Grieve  [[QC , was given the right to launch [[contempt of court  proceedings against Sky News over the broadcaster's alleged breach of a media injunction. It was in relation to the reporting of the story of [[Foreign hostages in Somalia|Paul and Rachel Chandler , a Kent couple who were held captive by [[Piracy off the coast of Somalia|Somali pirates  for 13 months. The media was blocked from publishing details of the couple's ""health and welfare"" prior to their being freed on 14 November 2010. Sky claims that it ""scrupulously observed the terms of the injunction"", but also admitted that it ""followed the spirit, if not the letter"" of the order. At the time, lawyers representing the Chandlers obtained the court order over fears that their lives could be put in danger by the media reporting their capture. Sky News was alleged to have breached the injunction on the day of their release around from Somalia, leading the Attorney General to seek permission at the [[High Court of Justice|High Court  to bring contempt proceedings. The Attorney General dropped the case in January 2012; a spokesperson for his office said that continuing with proceedings would no longer be in the public interest. * March 2013 – Sky News journalist Mark Stone and his camera operator were detained in [[Tiananmen Square  live on British television, in what he described as a surreal but telling episode about reporting in [[China . Viewers saw Stone being directed into a police van live from [[Beijing . The square is a popular tourist site near the regime's nerve centre and the scene of 1989 democracy protests that were crushed by the Chinese authorities. A police officer was filmed asking the Sky team to switch off their camera, saying they were now inside the [[Forbidden City  and did not have permission to film there. While they had permission to film in the square, Stone said police told him the team were not displaying their passes correctly, and noted he was not carrying his passport as required. China's foreign ministry insists that press censorship does not exist in the country, but journalists report the constant threat of interference from government officials.  ==Awards== Sky News won [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA awards  for coverage of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks  and the 2002 [[Soham murders .  Sky News's coverage of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings  won the 2006 International Emmy for Breaking News award, the coverage was commended as ""fast and accurate"".  In June 2007, Sky News was named Best News Channel at the Broadcast Digital Channel Awards. It beat several other national and international broadcasters, including [[Al Jazeera English  and the [[BBC .  The channel won a BAFTA Award in the News Category on 10 May 2015, for Alex Crawford's coverage of the 2014 Ebola crisis.  In 2018, Sky News was named [[Royal Television Society  News Channel of the Year, the eleventh time the channel had won the award.  ==Sponsorship== In November 2014, Sky News sponsored the Young Person in Business category of the [[British Chambers of Commerce#Chamber Awards|National Chamber Awards . It was won by Oliver Bryssau of Origin Broadband, which was named Business of the Year.  ==Bureaux and studios== Sky News has bureaux across the world, some are operated in conjunction with other media outlets.  ===Bureaux=== * [[Beijing , People's Republic of China * [[Brussels , Belgium * [[Dubai , United Arab Emirates *[[Dublin , Republic of Ireland  * [[Jerusalem , Israel * [[Johannesburg , South Africa * [[Melbourne , Australia  with [[Sky News Australia   * [[Moscow , Russia  with [[NTV Russia   * [[New Delhi , India  with [[Wion Tv  and [[Zee Live   * New York City, US  with [[Fox News Channel  and [[Fox Business Network   * [[Sydney , Australia  with Sky News Australia  * [[Washington, D.C. , US  with Fox News Channel   ===Additional live studios=== * [[Auckland , New Zealand  with [[Prime  New Zealand #Sky News New Zealand|Sky News New Zealand   * [[Adelaide , Australia  with [[Sky News Australia   * [[Brisbane , Australia  with Sky News Australia  * [[Canberra , Australia  with Sky News Australia  * [[Los Angeles , U.S.  with [[Fox News Channel  and [[Fox Business Network   * [[Milan , Italy  with [[Sky TG24   * [[Perth , Australia  with Sky News Australia  * [[Rome, Italy   with Sky TG24   ==Online==  News.sky.com is the channel's main website. It provides news, sport, weather, showbiz and business stories.  In 2009, the website changed to bring it in line with the on-screen look of Sky News. The site made use of [[Flash video  encoding to match the visual style of the TV channel with pictures and [[breaking news . The site underwent a further refresh in 2012, when both the look of the pages and the content management system were updated.  ==Virgin Media dispute== [[File:Sky News Virgin EPG.jpg|thumb|280x280px|Virgin Media's Electronic Program Guide contents after Virgin Media's contract to carry Sky News expired.  On 1 March 2007, Sky's agreement to provide its basic channels  including Sky News  to [[Virgin Media  expired. At midnight, Sky News was removed and the [[electronic program guide|EPG  entry for the channel was changed to ""Sky Snooze Try [[BBC News  TV channel |BBC "" until [[Sir Richard Branson  demanded the message be removed, saying: ""I have asked them to take it down. We do not mean any disrespect to Sky News. I think it is a very good news channel.""  Sky News, and the other Sky channels that had been removed, reappeared on Virgin Media on 13 November 2008.  ==See also== * [[List of television stations in the United Kingdom   ==References==   ==External links== *  * [https://news.sky.com/watch-live Live video] on Sky News provided via [[YouTube   ===Other websites=== *[https://tvnewsroom.org TV Newsroom] *[http://www.onastra.com/16848621/how-to-receive#!

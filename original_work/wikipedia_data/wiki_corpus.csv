As the ITV network consolidated from the mid 1990s onwards, ITN branding of news programmes was eventually dropped in March 1999 following the introduction of the ITV News brand. ITN remains the producer of all the national ITV News programmes.    History       September 1955 to July 1967     Image ITN 60s logo.jpg thumb right 200px The original ITN logo, as used between 1955 and 1969   ITN was set up by the  Independent Television Authority  to provide a new type of news service for the upcoming commercial television service Independent Television  ITV . Both ITN and ITV were launched on 22 September 1955, and the news service immediately broke new ground by introducing in-vision newscasters and reporter packages  incidentally, the first roster of regular ITN newscasters and reporters included marathon runner  Christopher Chataway ,  Robin Day , and  Reginald Bosanquet  . The unique, probing reporting style of Robin Day caused shock among politicians, finding themselves questioned continually for information – this had never been the case with the BBC. ITN also boasted the first British female newsreader,  Barbara Mandell , in 1956. Into the 1960s, reporters such as  George Ffitch ,  Alastair Burnet ,  Gordon Honeycombe ,  Huw Thomas  and  Sandy Gall  emerged as aspiring newscasters, under the leadership of editor  Geoffrey Cox  journalist  Geoffrey Cox .  The original ITN logo, featuring a large ""T"" flanked either side by ""I"" and ""N""  all encased within an outlined circle , was used from 1955 up to 1970. The original ITN theme tune was an excerpt of ''Non-Stop'', a piece of  light music  composed by  John Malcolm  composer  John Malcolm , used from 1955 up to 1982. As the years went on, full-length ITN news programmes were launched with their own theme music and particular branding  first ''News at Ten'', then ''First Report'', and finally ''News at 5.45'' , meaning that by its end, ''Non-Stop'' was only in use on generic news bulletins mainly at weekends.     July 1967 to January 1991    In 1967, ITN editor  Geoffrey Cox  journalist  Geoffrey Cox  suggested launching a half-hour news bulletin for ITV, every weeknight. ITV executives, however, were sceptical of that idea, because it was thought that viewers would not want a full 30 minutes of news every Monday to Friday  there had only been one half-hour news programme in Britain previously – BBC2's '' Newsroom  BBC programme  Newsroom '', launched in 1964 . However, the idea was approved on the condition it ran for a 13-week trial, and '' ITV News at Ten News at Ten '' was born on 3 July 1967. ITN's head newscasters – Alastair Burnet,  Andrew Gardner  newsreader  Andrew Gardner , and George Ffitch – presented the first ''News at Ten'', and the bulletin became so popular with viewers that it was kept in the schedules after its initial 13 weeks. The programme's titles used an excerpt of ''The Awakening'', a piece of dramatic music composed by  Johnny Pearson . The famous chimes of the  Big Ben Westminster Clock Tower  – affectionately known as ''the bongs'' – separated each headline as it was read out. The early opening title sequences were simplistic; for the first two years, the ITN symbol faded into a wide studio shot showing the two newscasters at the desk, with the caption ''News at 10''. Then, in 1970, a new title sequence was introduced  a slow pan of the  Palace of Westminster Houses of Parliament  was followed by a sharp zoom into the face of ""Big Ben"" showing the time of 22 00. The text ""Independent Television News"" was shown at the start of the sequence, followed by the individual words ""NEWS"", ""at"" and ""TEN"", which appeared in time to the title music. The sequence was amended a year later to feature the new ITN logo at the beginning. The logo, introduced in 1970, was a simple sans-serif outline of the phrase ""ITN"". The basic concept of the logo remains today.   Image News at Ten 1967.jpg thumb right 200px A still from an early ''News at Ten'' opening sequence from c. 1969.  On 16 October 1972, a twenty-minute lunchtime bulletin was introduced into the ITV schedule – ''First Report'', which was hosted by  Robert Kee  and ran from 12 40 to 13 00. This was followed on 6 September 1976 by the introduction of a new evening bulletin, the ''News at 545'', which ran from 17 45 to 18 00;  Michael Nicholson  and  Leonard Parkin  alternated in the newscaster chair. By this time, with three regular ITN bulletins throughout the day – and each having their own look and specially composed music – the original ITN ''Non-Stop'' theme music was only seen on generic summaries and weekend bulletins. In 1982, it was finally replaced with a synthesised alternative.  ''First Report'' was moved to 13 00 and retitled ''News at One'' in 1976; Leonard Parkin and  Peter Sissons  alternated in the presenter's chair. Michael Nicholson continued as main newscaster of the ''News at 545'', with  Martyn Lewis  journalist  Martyn Lewis  replacing Parkin as the relief presenter. In 1986, Nicholson left newscasting to return to war reporting and was replaced by  Alastair Stewart . Leonard Parkin retired in 1987, and Peter Sissons became a main newscaster for ITN's '' Channel 4 News ''  before moving to the BBC in 1989  – it was at this point that the programme revamped. It was moved to 12 30, and appropriately became the ''News at 12 30''.  Julia Somerville  joined ITN from the BBC's ''Nine O'Clock News'' to host the new programme, with  John Suchet  and  Jon Snow  journalist  Jon Snow  acting as relief presenters. In 1988, the programme returned to its original slot and once again became the ''News at One''; the presenting line-up remained unchanged. In 1989, Somerville left the programme to become a main presenter of ''News at Ten'', leaving Suchet to become the main lunchtime newscaster – the programme was revamped once more. In 1991, the programme moved back to the 12 30 slot, but retained the studio setting. In 1993, graphics were relaunched to bring it in line with other ITN news bulletins.  ''News at 545'' was replaced by the ''News at 540'' in 1989  following the introduction of the  ITV Weather ITV National Weather  forecast , and a new presenting team was formed comprising  Carol Barnes ,  Nicholas Owen  journalist  Nicholas Owen ,  Trevor McDonald ,  Fiona Armstrong , and Alastair Stewart. The programme lasted until March 1992 when it was renamed and relaunched, in line with other ITN bulletins.  ''News at Ten'' continued to rate as the most popular news programme on television. In 1988, the programme launched specially made opening titles featuring a  Computer-generated imagery computer generated  travel through London, up the River Thames until the camera stops at the ""Big Ben"" clockface.  ITN's regular newscasting team in the 1980s included Alastair Burnet, Sandy Gall, Leonard Parkin, Alastair Stewart, Trevor McDonald, Julia Somerville, Carol Barnes, Fiona Armstrong, John Suchet, Nicholas Owen, and a host of well-known reporters and correspondents.     January 1991 to February 2004    In 1991, ITN moved into its new building at Gray's Inn Road, London  previously owned by '' The Sunday Times '' . From this year, ITN news programmes revamped and moved to be presented from the ITV newsroom, foremostly to show the impressive atrium in the newly purchased headquarters – with the exception of the lunchtime programme which continued with its own studio and music, but took on elements of the new revamp – such as the serif font style newly introduced for ITN bulletins. The ''News at 12 30'' bulletin itself was renamed the ''Lunchtime News'' in 1992. The main lunchtime newscasters between 1992 and 1995 were  Nicholas Owen  journalist  Nicholas Owen  and Carol Barnes.  Dermot Murnaghan ,  Sonia Ruseler  and Julia Somerville acted as relief newscasters until 1995, when Murnaghan and Somerville became the bulletin's regular newscasters.  ''News at 540'' was renamed the ''Early Evening News'' on 2 March 1992 and presented from the ITV newsroom adjacent to the ITN atrium. John Suchet was the main newscaster for the ''Early Evening News'', and relief presenters included Carol Barnes, Nicholas Owen and Dermot Murnaghan.  <!-- Deleted image removed   Image TrevMcDonald10.jpg thumb Trevor McDonald presenting ''News at Ten'', 1996. The bulletin made him one of the most recognisable faces of British television news.  --> ''News at Ten'' underwent a revamp on 9 November 1992 after the departures of newscasters  Alastair Burnet   in August 1991  and  Sandy Gall   in early 1992, though he did remain at ITN filing special war reports for ''News at Ten'' . A new set was created for the programme, featuring television monitors, a large video screen, and a curved desk with ""News at Ten"" inscribed into it. Trevor McDonald became the sole newscaster of the programme. John Suchet, Dermot Murnaghan, and Julia Somerville were relief presenters for the bulletin. Initially, the new-look ''News at Ten'' was presented from the same studio as the ''Early Evening News'', adjacent to the ITV newsroom.  In 1995, all ITN programmes relaunched with a unified look, using blue colours  the corporate colour of ITN at the time . A new set was created in the former ''Early Evening News'' studio, adjacent to the atrium and next to the ITV newsroom. The glass walls were coated in semi-transparent blue perspex; the left wall looked onto the lobby of ITN's building, whilst the right showed the busy atmosphere of the ITV newsroom. Different variations on the theme music distinguished the main bulletins. Design firm  Lambie-Nairn  devised the new look, which saw special arrangements of the famous ''News at Ten'' music being used for the other bulletins  as composed by  David Hewson  composer  Dave Hewson  .  1999 saw the biggest and largest change to news bulletins on ITV. On 8 March 1999, all ITN programmes were rebranded under the name ''ITV News''. Under the leadership of  Granada Television Granada  chairman Charles Allen, the channel also controversially decided to axe the flagship ''News at Ten'' bulletin. However, ITN announced that the new budget meant it would have to cut staff despite already operating on a smaller budget than its two main rivals  BBC News  and  Sky News .     January 2008 to November 2009    In 2007, ITV plc's newly appointed chairman  Michael Grade  was reported as saying that the axing of the original ''News at Ten'' was ""the worst mistake ITV ever made""; This was confirmed when, on 9 February 2009, ITN refreshed ITV News to bring it more in line with the ''News at Ten'' studio set. All news bulletins began to be presented from behind a desk; a VR view over London appeared as the backdrop  different coloured versions were used depending on the time of day . Continuing the cohesive look across all programmes, VR glass screens also appeared in the studio to provide graphics and live links with correspondents and reporters. Almost all of the teal-coloured graphics of 2006 were replaced with reworked blue versions to provide some consistency with the rest of the ITV News look, but the teal clockface opening animation remained on the ITV News-branded bulletins. Jib camera pans across the studio replaced the previous title sequence; these shots were pre-recorded 10 to 15 minutes before transmission, because it is a difficult shot to achieve and cannot be done if other studio cameras are already in place.  In July 2009, to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the NASA moon landings, ITN produced five special 10-minute programmes for  ITV  TV network  ITV  titled ''Mission to the Moon – News from 1969''. The programmes took the form of news bulletins, reporting on the day's events of 1969. John Suchet, a former ITN newscaster, was the presenter of these specials; he was aided by a team of correspondents including  Andrea Catherwood   who had left ITV News in 2006  and  Peter Snow , who was an ITN newscaster and correspondent between 1962 and 1979. The first ''Mission to the Moon'' programme aired at 22 35 on ITV on Wednesday 15 July and continued the following Thursday, Friday, Sunday and Monday  Friday in Scotland, on  STV  TV network  STV  .  In August 2009, it was announced that after 16 years co-hosting '' London Tonight '', Alastair Stewart was to leave the regional magazine programme to become the main co-anchor of the ''ITV Evening News''. Mark Austin concentrates his energies on ''News at Ten'' but continues to present some editions of the 18 30 bulletin. It was also revealed that, following his successful stint as presenter of ''Election Night Live  America Decides'' in 2008, Stewart was to present the ITN/ITV coverage of the  United Kingdom general election, 2010 UK general election  in 2010.  The semi-circular ""Theatre of News"" studio set, in use for five years, was last broadcast on Sunday 1 November 2009.     November 2009 to January 2013     File ITV News.svg thumb ITV News logo from 2010–2013 120px  On 22 October 2009, it was jointly announced by ITN and ITV that ITV News would be rebranded from Monday 2 November. At the heart of the revamp was the removal of the famous image of the Big Ben clock tower from the opening sequence of ITV News programmes including ''News at Ten''; ITV executives felt, after ""months of deliberation"", that the imagery of the landmark promoted London-centricity to viewers outside the capital.     January 2013 onwards    On 16 November 2012 it was announced ITV News would rebrand in January 2013.    Regional news   The 2013 rebrand of ITV News saw the brand being extended to regional news programmes operated by  ITV plc  replacing the previous regional news titles. Regional ITV news programmes are produced by ITV plc, with the exception of the  ITV London  region which is produced by ITN. Since the creation of ITV plc in 2004 all regional news programmes in these regions have taken on a unified look and appearance on screen while structurally the merger has enabled ITV to create the ITV News Group consisting of ITN's national news service and the regional services provided by ITV plc.  STV  TV channel  STV  uses its own branding.

ITV has a long tradition of television news. Independent Television News  ITN  was founded to provide news bulletins for the network in 1955, and has since continued to produce all news programmes on ITV. The channel's news coverage has won awards from the Royal Television Society, Emmy Awards and BAFTAs. Between 2004 and 2008, the ITV Evening News held the title of ""RTS News Programme of the Year"". The flagship ITV News at Ten has won numerous BAFTA awards, and also being named ""RTS News Programme of the Year"" in 2011 and 2015. ITV News has the second-largest television news audience in the United Kingdom, second only to BBC News  and followed by other broadcasters such as Sky News, Channel 4 News and 5 News . However, its £43 million annual news budget is dwarfed by that of the publicly funded BBC, which spends £89.5 million annually on news-gathering, plus a further £23.1 million on its rolling news channel.Initially, all national news programmes on ITV carried ITN's own brand. As the ITV network consolidated from the mid 1990s onwards, ITN branding of news programmes was eventually dropped in March 1999 following the introduction of the ITV News brand. ITN remains the producer of all the national ITV News programmes.

Atkinson , c. 1910s  Atkinson was the ''Star''s editor from 1899 until his death in 1948. The newspaper's early opposition and criticism of the  Nazi Party Nazi regime </blockquote>  Atkinson became the controlling  shareholder  of the ''Star''. The ''Star'' was frequently criticized for practising the  yellow journalism  of its era. For decades, the paper included heavy doses of crime and sensationalism, along with advocating social change. From 1910 to 1973, the ''Star'' published a weekend supplement, the '' Star Weekly ''.  Shortly before his death in 1948, Joseph E. Atkinson transferred ownership of the paper to a charitable organization given the mandate of continuing the paper's liberal tradition. The five trustees of the charitable organization circumvented the Act by buying the paper themselves and swearing before the  Supreme Court of Ontario  to continue what became known as the ""Atkinson Principles""  and the Atkinson Principles continue to guide the paper to this day. In February 2006, ''Star'' media columnist  Antonia Zerbisias  wrote on her blog   <blockquote>Besides, we are the ''Star'' which means we all have the Atkinson Principles—and its multi-culti values—tattooed on our butts. Fine with me. At least we are upfront about our values, and they almost always work in favour of building a better Canada.  From 1922 to 1933, the ''Star'' was also a radio broadcaster on its station  CFCA  AM  CFCA , broadcasting on a  wavelength  of 400  metre s  749.48 kHz , whose coverage was complementary to the paper's reporting. In September 2002, the logo was changed, and ""The"" was dropped from the papers.

Until the mid-2000s, the front page of the ''Toronto Star'' had no advertising aside from lottery jackpot estimates from the  Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation   OLG .  On May 28, 2007, the ''Star'' unveiled a redesigned paper that features larger type, narrower pages, fewer and shorter articles, renamed sections, more prominence to local news, and less so to international news, columnists, and opinion pieces.  In 2018, The Toronto Star expanded its local coverge of Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Halifax with rebranded daily newspapers, previously known as Metro, as  StarMetro  newspaper  StarMetro .      Editorial position    Like its competitor '' The Globe and Mail '', the ''Star'' covers ""a spectrum of opinion that is best described as urban and  Central Canada Central Canadian "" in character. The ''Star'' is generally centrist and  centre-left , and is more  Social liberalism socially liberal  than ''The Globe and Mail''. The paper has been traditionally supportive of  Official bilingualism in Canada official bilingualism  and maintaining Canadian unity in opposition to  Quebec separatism . Conversely, Canadian sociologist Elke Winter wrote in 2011 that the ''Toronto Star'' was less ""Toronto-centric"" than its rival, ''The Globe and Mail'', writing that the ''Star'' ""consciously reports for and from Canada's most multicultural city"" and catered to a diverse readership. In the 14 federal elections between 1968 and 2015, the ''Star'' endorsed the Liberal Party ten times, the  New Democratic Party  two times, and the  Progressive Conservative Party of Canada Progressive Conservative Party  two times. but to avoid  vote-splitting  that could inadvertently help the Conservatives under  Stephen Harper , which it saw as the worst outcome for the country, the paper also recommended Canadians  Tactical voting vote strategically  by voting for ""the progressive candidate best placed to win"" in certain ridings. and  John Tory  in 2014.

In 2016, VOA broadcast an estimated 1,800 hours of radio and TV programming each week to approximately 236.6 million people worldwide with about 1,050 employees and a taxpayer-funded annual budget of .     History        American private shortwave broadcasting before World War II    Before World War II, all American shortwave stations were in private hands.</blockquote>  This policy was intended to enforce the State Department's  Good Neighbor Policy , but some broadcasters felt that it was an attempt to direct censorship.     Also included among the  cultural diplomacy  programming on the Columbia Broadcasting System was the musical show '' Viva America ''  1942-1949  which featured the Pan American Orchestra and the artistry of several noted musicians from both North and South America, including  Alfredo Antonini ,  Juan Arvizu ,  Eva Garza ,  Elsa Miranda ,  Nestor Mesta Chayres Nestor Mesta Chaires ,  Miguel Sandoval  composer  Miguel Sandoval ,  John Serry Sr. , and  Terig Tucci . Direct programming began a week after the United States’ entry into World War II in December 1941, with the first broadcast from the San Francisco office of the FIS via a leased  General Electric ’s transmitter to the Philippines in English  other languages followed . The next step was to broadcast to  Germany , which was called ''Stimmen aus Amerika''  ""Voices from America""  and was transmitted on February 1, 1942. It was introduced by "" The Battle Hymn of the Republic "" and included the pledge  ""Today, and every day from now on, we will be with you from America to talk about the war... The news may be good or bad for us – We will always tell you the truth.""  Asia n transmissions started with one transmitter in  California  in 1941; services were expanded by adding transmitters in  Hawaii  and, after recapture, the  Philippines .  About half of VOA's services, including the  Arabic language Arabic  service, were discontinued in 1945. The Soviet Union responded by initiating electronic  radio jamming jamming  of VOA broadcasts on April 24, 1949. From August 1952 through May 1953, Billy Brown, a high school senior in  Westchester County, New York , had a Monday night program in which he shared everyday happenings in  Yorktown Heights, New York . Brown's program ended due to its popularity  his ""chatty narratives"" attracted so much fan mail, VOA couldn't afford the $500 a month in clerical and postage costs required to respond to listeners' letters. However, after the collapse of the  Warsaw Pact  and the Soviet Union, interviews with participants in anti-Soviet movements verified the effectiveness of VOA broadcasts in transmitting information to socialist societies. It was followed by VOA Express, which from July 4, 1999 revamped into VOA Music Mix. Since November 1, 2014 stations are offered VOA1  which is a rebranding of VOA Music Mix .  In 1989, Voice of America expanded its  Mandarin Chinese Mandarin  and  Cantonese Chinese Cantonese  programming to reach the millions of Chinese and inform the country, accurately about the pro-democracy movement within the country, including the demonstration in Tiananmen Square.  Starting in 1990, the U.S. consolidated its international broadcasting efforts, with the establishment of the Bureau of Broadcasting.     Post–Cold War    With the breakup of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe, VOA added many additional language services to reach those areas. This decade was marked by the additions of Tibetan, Kurdish  to Iran and Iraq , Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, Macedonian, and  Rwanda-Rundi  language services.  In 1993, the  Clinton administration  advised cutting funding for  Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty  as it was felt post-Cold War information and influence was not needed in Europe. This plan was not well received, and he then proposed the compromise of the International Broadcasting Act. The  Broadcasting Board of Governors  was established and took control from the Board for International Broadcasters which previously oversaw funding for RFE/RL. broadcast-news organization to offer continuously updated programs on the Internet.      Cuts in services     The Arabic Service was abolished in 2002 and replaced by a new radio service, called the Middle East Radio Network or  Radio Sawa , with an initial budget of $22 million. Radio Sawa offered mostly Western and Middle Eastern popular songs with periodic brief news bulletins.  In May 16, 2004;  Worldnet Television and Film Service Worldnet , a satellite television service, was merged into the VOA network.  Radio programs in Russian ended in July 2008.  In 2013, VOA finished foreign language transmissions on shortwave and medium wave to Albania, Georgia, Iran and Latin America; as well as English language broadcasts to the Middle East and Afghanistan. Shortwave broadcasts in Azerbaijani, Bengali, Khmer, Kurdish, Lao, and Uzbek were dropped too. !! from !! to !! Website !!

The organization supports other groups that advocate alternative electoral practices, including FairVote Minnesota.  The result of a merger of several smaller groups promoting proportional representation reform into a single, nationalized advocacy group, it originally had co-founder  Rob Richie Robert Richie  as executive director, co-founder Matthew Cossolotto as president and third co-founder  Steven Hill  author  Steven Hill  as western regional director based in Seattle and later San Francisco.

Notable events include    1992   Ted Berry , the first African-American mayor of Cincinnati, conducts a welcoming speech at the CPR opening convention. Berry was a firm supporter of proportional representation and fought in the 1980s and 1990s to reinstate the practice in Cincinnati after its repeal in 1957.  1994  Robert Richie appears on national radio to explain a federal judge's ruling that cumulative voting be used to settle a voting rights case in ''Cane vs. Worcester County, M.D.''  1997  The Center releases ''Monopoly Politics'', a report on the undemocratic elements of the single winner plurality system.  2002  Led by western regional director Steven Hill, San Francisco becomes the first major city to pass a voter initiative, 54-46%, to adopt RCV for certain citywide elections is published, making the case for electoral system reform in the United States.  2004  San Francisco becomes the first city since Ann Arbor, MI in 1975 to use RCV in public elections, after suing recalcitrant city officials to compel compliance with the law.   2005  Arkansas institutes RCV for overseas military voters  2007  Maryland becomes the first state to pass the National Popular Vote plan for president   2012  Robert Richie writes for '' The Huffington Post '' supporting a national popular vote for president  2014  New York lawmakers pass a national popular vote bill that will award the state's electoral votes to the candidate who receives the majority of the popular vote  2016  Maine becomes the first state to adopt RCV statewide.  FairVote is headquartered in  Takoma Park, Maryland .     Mission    The stated mission of FairVote is ""to make representative democracy fair, functional, and representative by developing the analysis and educational tools necessary for our reform partners to secure and sustain improvements to American elections.""  The organization's projects fall into three broad categories  fair access to participation, fair elections, and fair representation. To that end, it sponsors programs like the Democracy Secretary of State  SoS  Project, which scrutinizes practices obstructing the voting process while proposing solutions to hold electoral officials accountable for their actions. The Promote Our Vote project focuses on local ideas to spur participation.    Public perception   '''General coverage'''  FairVote has been covered by many major news outlets, including '' The Washington Post '', '' The New York Times '', and  NPR , which tend to call it a  non-partisan nonpartisan   voting rights   advocacy group . Other writers claim that many FairVote policies, such as RCV, are popular in ""liberal enclaves"" Under this system, voters rank candidates in order of preference, in contrast to the more widely used  plurality voting  system. This is also called ""ranked-choice voting""  RCV , though many other  Ranked voting voting methods use ranked-choice ballots .  In 2002, FairVote backed a  San Francisco  ballot initiative amending Section 13.102 of the city charter to allow RCV in local elections.   Minneapolis, Minnesota   2009    Portland, Maine   2010    St. Paul, Minnesota   2011    Telluride, Colorado   2011  FairVote advocates the  National Popular Vote Interstate Compact , In this system, each candidate or party controls a share of seats equal to its share of the vote. The organization has proposed combining several congressional districts into one to allow for proportional representation in the  United States Congress , FairVote filed a policy brief in support of the legislation, stating, ""We believe that the right to vote is a cornerstone of representative democracy that depends upon broadly defined voter eligibility, universal voter access to the polls, and election integrity."" In addition, FairVote has begun publishing data on how much time sitting presidents spend in swing states. FairVote first categorizes each seat according to its competitiveness; seats are labeled Safe Democratic, Likely Democratic, Lean Democratic, Toss Up, Lean Republican, Likely Republican, or Safe Republican. By aggregating Congressional race data since 1982, the research attempts to highlight several elements of Congressional elections&nbsp;— the ratio of competitive to noncompetitive districts, the effects of  gerrymandering , and  voter turnout &nbsp;— that FairVote believes hurt the democratic process. In the report, every Congressional race is placed on a scale of competitiveness, from Tight  <5% margin of victory  to No Contest  >40% margin of victory , and the percentage of races within each category is tracked over time. In addition, the research tracks voter turnout and  wasted vote s over time. Lastly, the report follows the success of incumbents in winning reelection over time.  Finally, FairVote created Representation 2020, a project that hopes to achieve parity in the numbers of men and women serving in elected office. To that end, the project has issued reports on state election preparedness, interviewed state election officials, and published voter guides that focus on  election reform  policies. The project also hopes to popularize its candidate surveys, which include questions about election planning and election integrity. Notable recent cases in which they have been involved include      ''Sanchez v. City of Modesto''  2007      California voting rights act#Sanchez v. The City of Modesto ''Sanchez v. City of Modesto''   2007  dealt with the constitutionality of the  California Voting Rights Act  of 2001  CVRA .  FairVote argued that winner-take-all at-large voting systems caused ""vote dilutions in jurisdictions affected by racially polarized voting, even where minority voters cannot form a majority in a single member district.""  Asserting that the CVRA allows California to become more representative of the people, FairVote concluded that the CVRA was an important and constitutional piece of government reform.  In ''United States v. Village of Port Chester''  2008 , US District Judge Stephen Robinson of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a decision that the Village's election system violated the Voting Rights Act and ordered remedial plans from all parties.  In 2007, the Brennan Center, representing FairVote as amicus curiae, submitted a brief supporting cumulative voting as a remedy, but also proposing another system known as ""choice voting"", a process of ranking candidates. On November 6, 2009, the Court did not accept choice voting but accepted Port Chester's remedy of cumulative voting. On June 16, 2010, Port Chester elected its first Latino to the Board of Trustees.  ''Minnesota Voters Alliance v. City of Minneapolis'' dealt with the constitutionality of RCV, which was adopted by the City of Minneapolis for its municipal elections. They argued that this form of voting had legitimate policy reasons such as simplifying the election process, saving money, increasing voter turn-out, ensuring more diverse representation, and promoting civil election campaigns. and that ""Minneapolis IRV is constitutional because it is supported by legitimate interests, imposes no burden on the right to vote, and applies to all voters"".     ''Jauregi v. City of Palmdale''  2014      Juan Jauregui, the plaintiff, filed a complaint in April 2012 alleging that  Palmdale 's at-large method of electing members to its City Council resulted in vote dilution for Latino and African American residents.  The City of Palmdale immediately appealed the decision, reasoning that in 2001 Palmdale residents voted for an at-large election system.  FairVote argued that fair representation voting, unlike at-large systems, enhanced minority groups to elect at least one candidate of their choice.  However, the City of Palmdale opposed FairVote's participation, arguing that the amicus brief ""threatens significant prejudice to the City"" as it would continue to delay the certification of the City's November 2013 election. The California Court of Appeal has denied FairVote's application to file as amicus curiae.

The journal has an  impact factor  of 0.460, ranking 107th out of 161 journals in the category ""Political Science"".  Although Matthiessen was the financial angel of the new publication, from the outset the editorial task was handled by Sweezy and his co-thinker, the left wing popular writer  Leo Huberman . The author of an array of books and pamphlets during the 1930s and early 1940s, the  New York University -educated Huberman worked full-time on ''Monthly Review'' from its establishment until his death of a  heart attack  in 1968.  Briefly joining Sweezy and Huberman as a third founding editor of ''Monthly Review'' — although not listed as such on the publication's  masthead  publishing  masthead  — was German émigré  Otto Nathan   1893-1987 . Although his time of editorial association with ''MR'' was short, Nathan was instrumental in obtaining what would become a seminal essay for the magazine, a lead piece for the debut May 1949 issue by  physicist   Albert Einstein  entitled "" Why Socialism? ""  ''Monthly Review'' launched in 1949 with a circulation of just 450 copies, most of whom were personal acquaintances of either Huberman or Sweezy.     New Left era and after    From the middle years of the 1960s, radical political theory saw a resurgence in association with the emergence of a  New Left  in Europe and North America. ''Monthly Review'' grew in stature in tandem with this resurgence.  ''Monthly Review'' became steadily more critical of the  Soviet Union  in the 1960s and 1970s, with editor Paul Sweezy objecting to the  Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia  in 1968 and the suppression of the  Solidarity  Polish trade union  Polish trade union ""Solidarity""  through  Martial law in Poland martial law  in 1981. </blockquote>  Despite an apparent decline of the American Left in the 1980s, ''MR'''s circulation hovered in the 8,000 range throughout the decade.    Political orientation    From its first issue, ''Monthly Review'' attacked the premise that  capitalism  was capable of infinite growth through  Keynesianism Keynesian   macroeconomics macroeconomic  fine-tuning. Instead, the magazine's editors and leading writers have remained true to the traditional Marxist perspective that capitalist economies contain internal contradictions which will ultimately lead to their collapse and reconstitution on a new socialist basis. Topics of editorial concern have included  poverty , unequal distribution of incomes and wealth,  racism ,  imperialism  in relations between economically developed and less developed nations, and inefficiencies in production and distribution seen as endemic to the capitalist system.  In its editorial line ''Monthly Review'' offered critical support of the  Soviet Union  during its early years although over time the magazine became increasingly critical of Soviet dedication to  Socialism in One Country  and  peaceful coexistence , seeing that country as playing a more or less conservative role in a world marked by national revolutionary movements. After the  Sino-Soviet split  of the 1960s, Sweezy and Huberman soon came to see the People's Republic of China as the actual center of the world revolutionary movement.</blockquote>    Non-English editions   In addition to the U.S.-based magazine, there are seven sister editions of ''Monthly Review''. They are published in Greece; Turkey; Spain; South Korea; as well as separate English, Hindi, and Bengali editions in India.  Titles published by the press in its formative years include  ''The Empire of Oil'' by  Harvey O'Connor   1955 , ''The Political Economy of Growth''  became director of Monthly Review Press in 1967.

Wesley Knorpp, until it was bought by Midwestern newspaper magnate  Eugene C. Pulliam  in 1946. Stauffer and Knorpp had changed the newspaper's name to ''The Arizona Republic'' in 1930, and also had bought the rival '' Phoenix Gazette Phoenix Evening Gazette '' and ''Phoenix Weekly Gazette'', later known, respectively, as ''The Phoenix Gazette'' and the ''Arizona Business Gazette''.     Pulliam era    Pulliam, who bought the two ''Gazettes'' as well as the ''Republic'', ran all three newspapers until his death in 1975 at the age of 86. A strong period of growth came under Pulliam, who imprinted the newspaper with his conservative brand of politics and his drive for civic leadership. Pulliam was considered one of the influential business leaders who created the modern Phoenix area as it is known today.  Pulliam's holding company, Central Newspapers, Inc., as led by Pulliam's widow and son, assumed operation of the Republic/Gazette family of papers upon the elder Pulliam's death. ''The Phoenix Gazette'' was closed in 1997 and its staff merged with that of the ''Republic''. The ''Arizona Business Gazette'' is still published to this day.  In 1998, a weekly section geared towards  college  students, "" The Rep "", went into circulation. Specialized content is also available in the local sections produced for many of the different cities and suburbs that make up the Phoenix metropolitan area.

Founded by the American Jewish Committee in 1945 under the editorship of Elliot E. Cohen  editor from 1945 to 1959 , Commentary magazine developed into the leading postwar journal of Jewish affairs. The periodical strove to construct a new American Jewish identity while processing the events of the Holocaust, the formation of the State of Israel, and the Cold War. In its heyday, the magazine was edited by Norman Podhoretz from 1960 to 1995. Besides its strong coverage of cultural issues, Commentary provided a strong voice for the anti-Stalinist left. Podhoretz, originally a liberal Democrat turned neoconservative, moved the magazine to the right and toward the Republican Party in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, Commentary is regarded as providing well sourced information with a right wing bias in wording and story selection. Commentary has been described by Benjamin Balint as the ""contentious magazine that transformed the Jewish left into the neoconservative right"", while, according to historian and literary critic Richard Pells, ""no other journal of the past half century has been so consistently influential, or so central to the major debates that have transformed the political and intellectual life of the United States.""",History Founding and early years Norman Podhoretz Recent years Popular culture Contributors Notes References Bibliography External links,1,1

Domain name dispute     In 2005, the Al Jazeera TV channel attempted to obtain the aljazeera.com domain name  Views presented by Aljazeera.com are frequently misattributed to the Al Jazeera TV channel, The magazine's editorial slant appears markedly different than that of the Al Jazeera TV channel, with the former far more critical of U.S. and Israeli policy than the latter.  In April 2011, the domain aljazeera.com directed to  Al Jazeera English , and the domain ownership as listed on WHOIS records was updated from Al Jazeera Publishing to Al Jazeera Media Network. At the time of the purchase, a simple page stated ""Moving to Doha"", leading to certain long-time readers initially suspecting a hack of the website. No public details regarding the purchase of the domain has been made public by either party.    Activity since takeover   Since the takeover of aljazeera.com, Al Jazeera Media Network has subdivided the domain into other websites for their other non-Arabic news channels besides Al Jazeera English. In 2011 upon the launch of  Al Jazeera Balkans  the channel created balkans.aljazeera.com which became the main page for the Al Jazeera Balkans website.  In 2013 Al Jazeera did it again with the website for  Al Jazeera America  creating america.aljazeera.com which is the main page for that channels website and to which aljazeera.com in the United States redirected to on the first click into aljazeera.com during the existence of the American channel. From there you would have the option of going to the Al Jazeera English page. Al Jazeera is also used the .aljazeera.com domain for specials between the two channels and cross links between the two. After the folding of Al Jazeera America and a re-design of the main aljazeera.com the america.aljazeera.com address beginning in November 2016 was redirected to the main Aljazeera.com  In 2014 Al Jazeera created plus.aljazeera.com, a secondary page for their all digital, all online and video on demand channel  AJ+ . Its primary page is '''ajplus.net'''.  As part of a 2014 re-design of the Al Jazeera English site, a new video.aljazeera.com was launched that offers a live stream of Al Jazeera English and Al Jazeera English shows and documentaries on demand. It is possible that the site could include video from other Al Jazeera channels.

However, it retained the Times' building, which it used as a printing plant until 1975, when a new facility opened in Sterling Heights. The Times building was demolished in 1978.  The street in downtown Detroit where the Times building once stood is still called ""Times Square.""  The Evening News Association, owner of The News, merged with Gannett in 1985. At the time of its acquisition of The News, Gannett also had other Detroit interests, as its outdoor advertising company, which ultimately became Outfront Media through a series of mergers, operated many billboards across Detroit and the surrounding area, including advertising displays on Detroit Department of Transportation and Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority buses, with its only competitor, primarily along Metro Detroit's freeway network, being 3M National Advertising  now Lamar Advertising . The News claims to have been the first newspaper in the world to operate a radio station, station 8MK, which began broadcasting August 20, 1920.  8MK is now CBS-owned WWJ.  In 1947, it established Michigan's first television station, WWJ-TV, now WDIV-TV. In 1989, the paper entered into a 100-year joint operating agreement with the rival Free Press, combining business operations while keeping separate editorial staffs.  The combined company is called the Detroit Media Partnership  DMP . The Free Press moved into The News building in 1998 and until May 7, 2006, the two published a single joint weekend edition. Today, The News is published Monday–Saturday, and has an editorial page in the Sunday Free Press. The Detroit News has won three Pulitzer Prizes.",History The Future Columnists and staff writers Awards See also References External links,1,4

Articles and comment columns are now contributed by writers from  socialist ,  communist ,  social democratic ,  Green politics Green  and  religious  perspectives. The first edition was produced on 1 January 1930  This contradicted the position of the  Comintern  in the aftermath of the  Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact   which became CPGB policy on 3 October  that the war was a struggle between rival imperialist powers, and Campbell was removed as editor as a result, being replaced by  William Rust  journalist  William Rust . Citrine sued the ''Daily Worker'' for libel after it accused him and his associates of ""plotting with the French Citrines to bring millions of Anglo-French Trade Unionists behind the Anglo-French imperialist war machine""; the publisher pleaded the British press equivalent of 'fair comment'. Citrine alleged, in response to his lawyer's questioning, that the ''Daily Worker'' received £2,000 pounds per month from ""Moscow"", and that Moscow directed the paper to print anti-war stories.   On 21 January 1941, publication of the newspaper was suppressed by the  Home Secretary  in the wartime coalition,  Herbert Morrison   a  Labour Party  UK  Labour Party  MP . It had repeatedly ignored a July 1940 warning that its pacifist line contravened Defence Regulation 2D, which made it an offence to 'systematically to publish matter calculated to foment opposition to the prosecution of the war'. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in  Operation Barbarossa  in June 1941, the situation changed; British Communists became fervent supporters of the war, and the ban was later lifted. The government's ban on the ''Daily Worker'' was lifted in September 1942, following a campaign supported by  Hewlett Johnson , the  Dean of Canterbury , and Professor  J. B. S. Haldane . A  ""Lift the ban"" conference at  Central Hall, Westminster  on 21 March 1942 was attended by over 2,000 delegates. A key part of the campaign was to secure Labour Party support  Herbert Morrison was a fierce opponent of the ''Daily Worker'' . On 26 May 1942, after a heated debate, the Labour Party carried a resolution declaring the Government must lift the ban on the ''Daily Worker''.  During the ban, the ''Daily Worker'' offices at Cayton Street were totally destroyed by fire during  the Blitz  on 16 April 1941. The paper moved temporarily in 1942 to the former Caledonian Press offices in Swinton Street  whence the old Communist Party ''Sunday Worker'', edited by William Paul, had been published from 15 March 1925 until 1929 . New offices were acquired in 1945, at a former brush-makers' warehouse at 75  Farringdon Road , for the sum of £48,000. A Scottish edition of the ''Daily Worker'' was produced from its plant in  Glasgow  from 11 November 1940.  The ''Daily Worker'' welcomed the dropping of the  Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb on Hiroshima , editorialising ""The employment of the new weapon on a substantial scale should expedite the surrender of Japan"". and even 500,000.  The ''Daily Worker'' was fully supportive of the show trials in  Hungary ,  Czechoslovakia  and  Bulgaria  in the late 1940s, as well as the split with  Josip Broz Tito Tito  and Yugoslavia in 1948. The paper denounced the attempted revolution as a ""white terror"", invoking the  Kingdom of Hungary  1920–46  Horthy regime  and earlier  White Terror  Hungary  1919–1921  period. attended by about 10,000 people. Guests were entertained by tableaux set to music.  Paul Robeson  also sent recorded messages which were played during the rallies.    ''Morning Star''  1966–present        History    The first edition of the ''Morning Star'' appeared on Monday, 25 April 1966.  South African people South African  exile  Sarah Carneson  worked for the newspaper in the late 1960s. Its Chief Executive from 1975 was Mary Rosser. An editorial in ''The Guardian'', however, reported in 1977 that the paper was giving coverage to dissidents in  Czechoslavakia  and elsewhere in the Soviet bloc to the consternation of about a third of CPGB members who wanted a reversal to a strictly pro-Kremlin line. ""The ''Morning Star'' is open for genuine debate about the future of the Left"", it asserted. In 1982, the ''Morning Star'' attacked the attitudes of '' Marxism Today '', the party's monthly journal, which was controlled by the Eurocommunists. The paper supported the  National Union of Mineworkers  Great Britain  National Union of Mineworkers   NUM  during the  UK miners' strike  1984–1985  miners' strike of 1984–1985 , but the party had become critical of NUM leader  Arthur Scargill 's strategy towards the end of the strike.  Soviet bulk orders ended abruptly in 1989  the  Communist Party of the Soviet Union  had still been buying 6,000 copies every day , and the termination of this order, with only a week's notice, was the cause of ""huge financial disruption"".     Editorial policy     Successive annual general meetings of the People's Press Printing Society have agreed that the policy of the paper is founded on '' Britain's Road to Socialism '', the programme of the  Communist Party of Britain . The newspaper also opposed the  Iraq War . On  Northern Ireland , the paper takes a pro- Irish nationalism  line. News reports from Northern Ireland are described as ""By Our Foreign Desk"".  In its masthead, the paper asserts that it supports peace and  socialism . It is  Euroscepticism Eurosceptic  and supported the  No2EU  platform in the  European Parliament election, 2009  United Kingdom  2009 European Parliament election .

Benfield had previously been deputy editor and head of production, but suffered from ill health. and the cover price does not cover print and distribution. Consequently, the paper has always been dependent on donations from activists, readers, and trade unions. The paper relies on its ""Star Fund"" appeal  monthly target £16,000 .

Criticism     File NoMoreAolCDs in Aachen.JPG thumb 200px A collection of AOL CDs sent to a student dormitory in Germany, 2002  In its earlier incarnation as a "" Closed platform walled garden "" community and service provider, AOL received criticism for its community policies, terms of service, and customer service. Prior to 2006, AOL was known for its direct mailing of CD-ROMs and 3½"" floppy disks containing its software. The disks were distributed in large numbers; at one point, half of the CDs manufactured worldwide had AOL logos on them.  AOL began drastically reducing the responsibilities and privileges of its volunteers in 2000.  The program was eventually ended on June 8, 2005.  Current Community Leaders at the time were offered 12 months of credit on their accounts in thanks for their service.  Within one decade of the class action lawsuit being filed, the class had grown to over 6,000 members, comprising the largest class action lawsuit ever filed against an internet based company.  Currently it is the third largest class ever involved in any lawsuit on a federal level in the United States, affecting ultimately the employment eligibility of individuals in an online environment.  In February 2010, a settlement was approved by the Courts in the class action suit. The settlement included a US$15&nbsp;million payment. This payment was then divided into thirds, the first of which was attorney and legal fees. Five million was then divided among the included members of the class which consisted of more than 7,000 individual former Community Leaders. The final five million dollars was donated to charities hand picked by Hallissey and Williams, and then approved by the Courts for distribution.  One such charity, the Remote Area Medical Foundation  www.ramusa.org , received payments in excess of US$1.2&nbsp;million for the provision of medical services, supplies and medication for those in need within the more rural areas of the United States and beyond.  Prior to the 1999 class action lawsuit, the community leaders were informed of a change in compensation for duties performed by AOL.  Community leaders would be charged a reduced rate per month for their accounts, and would no longer be given unlimited access without invoice.  During this live announcement via an online meeting of all community leaders in a virtual arena, Brian Williams of Dallas led many community leaders in a virtual ""strike"" or ""sit-in"" to protest the new charges the community leaders were now being asked to pay.  This protest or strike is noted as the first of its kind for an online environment and was nicknamed for the row of the arena it was held in  Row 800.  Following the protest, AOL terminated the online working relationship between itself and several of the Community Leaders involved.  Quickly following the release of these community leaders, each was reinstated, with the  exception of Williams, due to his role in the protest.  During this time, Williams' role on AOL was that of Guide XNT  Guide Program , CB Naked  Crystal Ball forum , VnV Naked  iVillage's Vices and Virtues Forum  and JCommBrian  Jewish Community Online Forum .      Billing disputes     AOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a class action lawsuit. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute  thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes . AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won  some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP . AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.  AOL was sued by the  Ohio Attorney General  in October 2003 for improper billing practices. The case was settled on June 8, 2005.

It is a brand marketed by Verizon Media. The service traces its history to an online service known as PlayNET, which hosted multi-player games for the Commodore 64. PlayNET licensed their software to a new service, Quantum Link  Q-Link , who went online in November 1985. PlayNET shut down shortly thereafter. The initial Q-Link service was similar to the original PlayNET, but over time Q-Link added many new services. When a new IBM PC client was released, the company focussed on the non-gaming services and launched it under the name America Online. The original Q-Link was shut down on November 1, 1995, while AOL grew to become the largest online service, displacing established players like CompuServe and The Source. By 1995, AOL had about 20 million active users.AOL was one of the early pioneers of the Internet in the mid-1990s, and the most recognized brand on the web in the United States. It originally provided a dial-up service to millions of Americans, as well as providing a web portal, e-mail, instant messaging and later a web browser following its purchase of Netscape. In 2001, at the height of its popularity, it purchased the media conglomerate Time Warner in the largest merger in U.S. history. AOL rapidly declined thereafter, partly due to the decline of dial-up and rise of broadband. AOL was eventually spun off from Time Warner in 2009, with Tim Armstrong appointed the new CEO. Under his leadership, the company invested in media brands and advertising technologies. On June 23, 2015, AOL was acquired by Verizon Communications for $4.4 billion. In the following months, AOL also made a deal with Microsoft.","History 1983–1991  Early years 1991–2006  Internet age, Time Warner merger 2006–2009  Rebranding and decline 2009–2015  As a digital media company 2015–present  Division of Verizon Products and services Content Advertising Membership AOL Desktop Criticism Community leaders Billing disputes Account cancellation Direct marketing of disks Software Usenet newsgroups Terms of Service  TOS  Certified email Search data User list exposure AOL's Computer Checkup ""scareware"" NSA Prism program Hosting of user profiles changed, then discontinued See also References External links",2,3

Until September 2011, the paper described itself on the banner at the top of every newspaper as ""free from party political bias, free from proprietorial influence"". It was produced by Newspaper Publishing plc and created by  Andreas Whittam Smith ,  Stephen Glover  columnist  Stephen Glover  and Matthew Symonds. All three partners were former journalists at '' The Daily Telegraph '' who had left the paper towards the end of  Michael Berry, Baron Hartwell Lord Hartwell 's ownership.  Marcus Sieff  was the first chairman of Newspaper Publishing, and Whittam Smith took control of the paper.  In April 1996, there was another refinancing, and in March 1998, O'Reilly bought the other shares of the company for £30&nbsp;million, and assumed the company's debt. Brendan Hopkins headed Independent News,  Andrew Marr  was appointed editor of ''The Independent'', and  Rosie Boycott  became editor of ''The Independent on Sunday''. Marr introduced a dramatic if short-lived redesign which won critical favour but was a commercial failure, partly as a result of a limited promotional budget. Marr admitted his changes had been a mistake in his book, ''My Trade''.     2000–2009     Ivan Fallon, on the board since 1995 and formerly a key figure at ''The Sunday Times'', replaced Hopkins as head of Independent News & Media in July 2002. By mid-2004, the newspaper was losing £5&nbsp;million per year. A gradual improvement meant that by 2006, circulation was at a nine-year high. The two newspaper groups' editorial, management and commercial operations remained separate, but they shared services including security, information technology, switchboard and payroll.     2010–2016     On 25 March 2010, Independent News & Media sold the newspaper to  Russian oligarchs Russian oligarch   Alexander Lebedev  for a nominal £1 fee and £9.25m over the next 10 months, choosing this option over closing ''The Independent'' and ''The Independent on Sunday'', which would have cost £28m and £40m respectively, due to long-term contracts. of plagiarism and inaccuracy.      From 2016     In March 2016 ''The Independent'' decided to close its print edition and become an  Online newspaper online newspaper ; the last printed edition was published on Saturday 26 March 2016. ''The Independent on Sunday'' published its last print edition on 20 March 2016 and was closed following that. After launching in the London area and then in  North West England , A new second section, ""Extra"", was introduced on 25 April 2006. It is similar to ''The Guardian''s ""G2"" and ''The Times''s ""Times2"", containing features, reportage and games, including  sudoku . In June 2007, ''The Independent on Sunday'' consolidated its content into a news section which included sports and business, and a magazine focusing on life and culture. From 26 October 2010, the same day as its sister paper, ''i'', was launched, ''The Independent'' was printed on slightly thicker paper than before and ceased to be full-colour throughout, with many photographs and pictures  though none of those used in adverts  being printed in black and white only. On 11 October 2011, ''The Independent'' unveiled yet another new look, featuring a red, sans-serif masthead. In November 2013, the whole newspaper was overhauled again, including new custom fonts and a vertical masthead in black.     Front pages    Following the 2003 switch in format, ''The Independent'' became known for its unorthodox and campaigning front pages, which frequently relied on images, graphics or lists rather than traditional headlines and written news content. For example, following the Kashmir earthquake in 2005, it used its front page to urge its readers to donate to its appeal fund, and following the publication of the  Hutton Inquiry Hutton Report  into the death of British government scientist  David Kelly  weapons expert  David Kelly , its front page simply carried the word ""Whitewash?""     Sections    The weekday, Saturday and Sunday editions of ''The Independent'' all included supplements and pull-out subsections   {   - valign top  width 50%  Daily  Monday to Friday  ''The Independent''   ""Monday Sport""  A weekly pull-out containing reports of the previous weekend's sporting events.

""Radar""  A compact, primarily  listings magazine , including television schedules, film and DVD reviews and events listings for the coming week. It also includes a round-up of the ""50 best"" items in a particular category. For example, over the Christmas period there are weekly supplements of ""Gifts for him"" and ""Gifts for her"".

"" Rainbow List "" An annually-updated list, first published in 2000, then as the ""Pink List"", of the most famous and influential people who have declared themselves lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.    Political views   When the paper was established in 1986, the founders intended its political stance to reflect the centre of the British political spectrum and thought that it would attract readers primarily from ''The Times'' and ''The Daily Telegraph''. It has been seen as leaning to the left wing of the political spectrum, making it more a competitor to '' The Guardian '', although both also feature conservative columnists. ''The Independent'' tends to take a  classical liberal , pro-market stance on economic issues.  In addition, ''The Independent'' has highlighted what it refers to as ""war crimes"" being committed by pro-government forces in the  War in Darfur Darfur  region of Sudan.  In 2007,  Alan Rusbridger , editor of ''The Guardian'', said of ''The Independent''  ""The emphasis on views, not news, means that the reporting is rather thin, and it loses impact on the front page the more you do that"".

Scientific and political debate   In April 1950, the U.S.  United States Atomic Energy Commission Atomic Energy Commission  ordered ''Scientific American'' to cease publication of an issue containing an article by  Hans Bethe  that appeared to reveal classified information about the thermonuclear  hydrogen bomb . Subsequent review of the material determined that the AEC had overreacted. The incident was important for the ""new"" ''Scientific American'''s history, as the AEC's decision to burn 3000 copies of an early press-run of the magazine containing the offending material appeared to be "" book burning  in a free society"" when publisher Gerard Piel leaked the incident to the press. Journalist  Ronald Bailey  called the criticism ""disturbing"" and ""dishonest"", writing, ""The subhead of the review section, 'Science defends itself against ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'',' gives the show away  Religious and political views need to defend themselves against criticism, but science is supposed to be a process for determining the facts."" In response, '' Wall Street Journal '' online columnist  James Taranto  jokingly called ''Scientific American'' ""a liberal political magazine"".  An editorial in the September 2016 issue of Scientific American attacked U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump for alleged ""anti-science"" attitudes and rhetoric.

Some supporters of the Niskanen Center are more traditionally aligned with  left-libertarianism left-libertarian  causes. They include the  Open Philanthropy Project , which supports the Center's work to expand legal immigration, The Center seeks to embrace relative policy improvements, which includes putting forth  theory of the second best second best  or even third best or fourth best solutions, rather than a single, optimal one, and seeks to include the preferences of potential allies who do not share its beliefs.     Policy areas     The Niskanen Center focuses on four distinct areas of public policy  climate change, foreign policy and defense, immigration reform, and technology and civil liberties. The Niskanen Center also endorses the understanding of climate change as  Anthropogenic climate change anthropogenic  and believes that government action is a necessary component of mitigating the risks associated with long term sea level rise and extreme weather events associated with climate change. Taylor explained his shift in a 2015 interview with Vox, indicating that he had ""fundamentally switched"" his previous beliefs on the issue after seeing new scientific evidence and the more general strengthening over time of the case for the dangers of climate change, as well as arguments from fellow libertarians about responses to the challenge of climate change that were consistent with and even required by a libertarian political stance. In the early 2000s, while debating climate activist  Joe Romm , he based part of his argument on the fact that the world had not warmed as much as  NASA  climate scientist  James Hansen  had predicted it would in his 1988 congressional testimony. The Center for Climate Science publishes analysis of climatology research in support of anthropogenic theories of global warming. Majkut has sought to position the Niskanen Center as an opponent of the Cato Institute's Dr.  Patrick J. Michaels , a prominent skeptic within the scientific community. The grant was made as part of the  Open Philanthropy Project , a spinoff of a collaboration between Good Ventures and charity evaluator  GiveWell .   <blockquote>The debate is often cast between the ""job elimination deniers"" and the apocalyptic doomsayers, but there is a great deal of substance and nuance that is lost in such a  mis characterization. The real questions are what the intervening period of dislocation looks like, who gets hurt the hardest, and what the short-term political ramifications of this dynamic transformation means for the people experiencing those changes first hand.       Civil liberties      In particular, the technology and civil liberties department focuses on reforming government surveillance.</blockquote>  Ryan Hagemann leads the department and had previously authored works on commercial drones and autonomous vehicles with the  Mercatus Center 's Technology Policy Program.</blockquote>      Poverty and welfare     The Center's Poverty & Welfare department is currently headed by Samuel Hammond, who earned his bachelor's degree in economics with honors from Saint Mary's University and his master's in economics from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada.     Philosophy and political theory    The Niskanen Center has sought to differentiate itself from other think tanks on the  Conservatism in the United States political right  by espousing a position of strategic compromise, including on issue areas that break from doctrinaire  noninterventionism noninterventionist  and  free market free-market  positions. In addition to taking an aggressive stance in favor of climate change action and  carbon tax es, the center generally supports the maintenance of a more robust welfare state  safety net  in exchange for other market reforms. Vice President for Policy Will Wilkinson advocates a  social democracy -style system that incorporates the position of  liberalism liberal  political philosopher  John Rawls . This ideal mirrors European states such as  Denmark  that pair free trade liberalism and labor market reform with heavy unemployment benefits and a public healthcare system.  In early 2016, the Niskanen Center published a post on the ""libertarian case"" for  democratic socialism socialist   Democratic Party  United States  Democratic  presidential candidate  Bernie Sanders . As Wilkinson wrote, ""The libertarian case for Bernie Sanders is simply that Bernie Sanders wants to make America more like Denmark, Canada, or Sweden ... and the citizens of those countries enjoy more liberty than Americans do. No other candidate specifically aims to make the United States more closely resemble a freer country.""</blockquote>  Their arguments for Sanders provoked a heated discussion by other libertarian commentators about whether there was a case to be made for Bernie Sanders.  Megan McArdle  countered that the thought of backing Sanders was ""fun, but not convincing."" ""We heard a similar argument about Obamacare spurring entrepreneurship, which sounded splendid except for the total lack of evidence that national health care schemes had caused entrepreneurship to surge anywhere."" Rhetorical exercise or not, the idea of a ""libertarian case for Bernie Sanders"" helped contribute to a debate among libertarians about ideological priors during the 2016 election cycle.

Originally pitched to the middle-class reader, it was converted into a working-class newspaper after 1934, in order to reach a larger audience. The ''Mirror'' has had a number of owners. It was founded by  Alfred Harmsworth , who sold it to his brother  Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere Harold Harmsworth   from 1914 Lord Rothermere  in 1913. In 1963 a restructuring of the media interests of the Harmsworth family led to the ''Mirror'' becoming a part of  IPC Media#International Publishing Corporation International Publishing Corporation .

The paper has consistently supported the  Labour Party  UK  Labour Party  since the  United Kingdom general election, 1945 1945 general election . Hence the name  he said, ""I intend it to be really a mirror of feminine life as well on its grave as on its lighter sides&nbsp;... to be entertaining without being frivolous, and serious without being dull"". The first issue of the relaunched paper did not have advertisements on the front page as previously, but instead news text and engraved pictures  of a traitor and an actress , with the promise of photographs inside. Circulation continued to grow  in 1919, some issues sold more than a million copies a day, making it the largest daily picture paper.  With  Cecil Harmsworth King Cecil King   Rothermere's nephew  in charge of the paper's finances and Guy Bartholomew as editor, during the late 1930s the ''Mirror'' was transformed from a conservative, middle class newspaper into a  left-wing politics left-wing  paper for the working class. In the  United Kingdom general election, 1945 1945 general election  the paper strongly supported the  Labour Party  UK  Labour Party  in its eventual landslide victory. In doing so, the paper supported Herbert Morrison, who co-ordinated Labour's campaign, and recruited his former antagonist Philip Zec to reproduce, on the front page, a popular  VE Day  cartoon on the morning of the election, suggesting that Labour were the only party who could maintain peace in post-war Britain.

Richard Wallace and Tina Weaver, the respective editors of the ''Daily Mirror'' and ''Sunday Mirror'', were simultaneously dismissed and  Lloyd Embley , editor of ''The People'', appointed as editor of the combined title with immediate effect. The ''Mirror''s continued support of the Labour government was in spite of its falling popularity over the previous few months which had been the result of the  Winter of Discontent , where the country was crippled by numerous public sector strikes. However, the Tories were re-elected and Labour suffered its worst postwar general election result, only narrowly bettering the SDP-Liberal Alliance in terms of votes, though winning considerably more seats. However, the Tories were re-elected for a third successive term, although Labour did cut the Tory majority slightly.  By the time of the  United Kingdom general election, 1997 1997 general election , support for the Labour Party, now led by  Tony Blair , in the opinion polls had exceeded that of support for the Tory government  still led by John Major  since late 1992, the government's reduced popularity largely blamed on the failings of  Black Wednesday  in September of that year and it had failed to recover popularity in spite of a strong economic recovery and fall in unemployment. A reinvented ""New Labour"" had further improved its credibility under Blair by promising traditional Labour essentials including more funding for healthcare and education, but also promising not to increase income tax and ending its commitment to the nationalisation of leading industries.  The newspaper was critical of the Liberal Democrats for forming the coalition which enabled the Conservatives to form a new government in 2010, and branded leader  Nick Clegg  as Pinickio  alluding to the lying fictional character  Pinocchio      Famous features      Cartoon strips "" Pip, Squeak and Wilfred ""  1919–56 , "" Jane  comic strip  Jane ""  1932–59 , "" Garth  comic strip  Garth ""  1943–97, reprints 2011 , "" Just Jake ""  1938–52 , "" Andy Capp ""  1957– , and "" The Perishers ""  1955–2006 and later reprints .

In 1991, shortly after the death of  Queen  band  Queen <nowiki/>'s lead singer  Freddie Mercury , the ''Daily Mirror'' ran a  homophobia homophobic  column by  Joe Haines  which contained extensive insults towards Mercury,  HIV/AIDS  victims, and homosexuals.   In May 2004, the ''Daily Mirror'' published what it claimed were photos of British soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners at an unspecified location in Iraq. The decision to publish the photos, subsequently shown to be hoaxes, led to Morgan's sacking as editor on 14 May 2004. The ''Daily Mirror'' then stated that it was the subject of a ""calculated and malicious hoax"".   In November 2007, the ''Daily Mirror'' paid damages to Sir Andrew Green after having likened him and his group  MigrationWatch UK  to the  Ku Klux Klan  and  Nazi Party  in September of that year. The newspaper admitted that such allegations were ""untrue"".   On 18 September 2008, David Anderson, a British sports journalist writing for the ''Mirror'', repeated a claim deriving from vandalism on Wikipedia's entry for Cypriot football team  AC Omonia , which asserted that their fans were called ""The Zany Ones"" and liked to wear hats made from discarded shoes. The claim was part of Anderson's match preview ahead of AC Omonia's game with  Manchester City F.C. Manchester City , which appeared in the web and print versions of the ''Mirror'', with the nickname also quoted in subsequent editions on 19 September.   On 12 May 2011, the  High Court of England and Wales  granted the  Attorney General for England and Wales Attorney General  permission to bring a case for contempt against ''The Sun'' and the ''Daily Mirror'' for the way they had reported on the arrest of a person of interest in the  Murder of Joanna Yeates .   On 19 July 2011 the ''Mirror'' published an article labelling comedian  Frankie Boyle  as a racist. He later sued for defamation and libel, winning £54,650 in damages and a further £4,250 for a claim about his departure from '' Mock the Week ''. The ''Mirror'' had argued he was ""forced to quit"" but this was found to be libellous by the court.

It is owned by parent company Reach plc. From 1985 to 1987, and from 1997 to 2002, the title on its masthead was simply The Mirror. It had an average daily print circulation of 716,923 in December 2016, dropping markedly to 587,803 the following year. Its Sunday sister paper is the Sunday Mirror.  Unlike other major British tabloids such as The Sun and the Daily Mail, the Mirror has no separate Scottish edition; this function is performed by the Daily Record and Sunday Mail, which incorporate certain stories from the Mirror that are of Scottish significance. Originally pitched to the middle-class reader, it was converted into a working-class newspaper after 1934, in order to reach a larger audience. The Mirror has had a number of owners. It was founded by Alfred Harmsworth, who sold it to his brother Harold Harmsworth  from 1914 Lord Rothermere  in 1913. In 1963 a restructuring of the media interests of the Harmsworth family led to the Mirror becoming a part of International Publishing Corporation. During the mid 1960s, daily sales exceeded 5 million copies, a feat never repeated by it or any other daily  non-Sunday  British newspaper since. The Mirror was owned by Robert Maxwell between 1984 and 1991. The paper went through a protracted period of crisis after his death before merging with the regional newspaper group Trinity in 1999 to form Trinity Mirror. During the 1930s the paper was editorially sympathetic to Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists. The paper has consistently supported the Labour Party since the 1945 general election.","History 1903–95 1995–2004 2004–present Political allegiance Famous features Blue issue Libel, contempt of court, errors and criticism Significant staff members Editors Notable columnists Awards See also Notes References External links",1,1

170,1,tribunemagazine.org,Category 1937 establishments in England Category British political magazines Category British weekly magazines Category Labour Party  UK  publications Category London magazines Category Magazines established in 1937 Category Socialist magazines Category Socialist newspapers published in the United Kingdom,"   '''''Tribune''''' is a  democratic socialist  magazine, founded in 1937 and published in London. It is independent but has usually supported the  Labour Party  UK  Labour Party  from the  Left-wing politics left . From 2009 to 2018 it faced serious financial difficulties until it was purchased by Jacobin Publisher  Bhaskar Sunkara  in early 2018, shifting to a quarterly publication model.    Origins   ''Tribune'' was founded in early 1937 by two wealthy left-wing Labour Party  Member of Parliament Members of Parliament   MPs ,  Sir Stafford Cripps  and  George Strauss , to back the  Socialist League  UK, 1932 #The Unity Campaign Unity Campaign , an attempt to secure an anti-fascist and anti-appeasement  United Front  between the Labour Party and socialist parties to the left. The latter included Cripps's  Labour-affiliated   Socialist League  UK, 1932  Socialist League , the  Independent Labour Party   ILP  and the  Communist Party of Great Britain   CP .  The paper's first editor was  William Mellor  journalist  William Mellor . Among its journalists were  Michael Foot  and Barbara Betts  later  Barbara Castle  , while the board included the Labour MPs  Aneurin Bevan  and  Ellen Wilkinson ,  Harold Laski  of the  Left Book Club  and the veteran left-wing journalist and former-ILPer  H. N. Brailsford .  Mellor was fired in 1938 for refusing to adopt a new CP policy—supported by Cripps—of backing a  Popular Front , including non-socialist parties, against fascism and appeasement; Foot resigned in solidarity. Mellor was succeeded by  Communist front H.J. Hartshorn , a secret member of the Communist Party; meanwhile  Victor Gollancz , the Left Book Club's publisher, joined the board of directors. For the next year, the paper was little more than an appendage of the Left Book Club, taking an uncritical line on the Popular Front and the Soviet Union.    The 1940s   In 1939, with the  Nazi-Soviet pact  and the outbreak of the  World War II Second World War , ''Tribune'' initially adopted the CP's position of denouncing the war as imperialist. But after the Soviet invasion of Finland, with Cripps off on a world tour, Strauss and Bevan became increasingly impatient with Hartshorn's unrelenting  Stalinism .  Strauss fired him in February 1940, replacing him as editor with  Raymond Postgate . Under Postgate's  editorship, the Soviet  fellow travellers  at ''Tribune'' were either dismissed, or, in Postgate's words ""left soon after in dislike of me"".  Kimche left ''Tribune'' to join Reuters in 1945, his place being taken by  Frederic Mullally . After the Labour landslide  United Kingdom general election, 1945 election victory of 1945 , Bevan joined  Clement Attlee 's government and formally left the paper, leaving Mullally and  Evelyn Anderson  as joint editors, with Foot playing Bevan's role of political director. Over the next five years, ''Tribune'' was critically involved in every key political event in the life of the Labour government and reached its highest-ever circulation, of some 40,000. Foot persuaded Kimche to return as joint editor in 1946  after Mullally's departure to the  Sunday Pictorial   and eventually himself became joint editor with Anderson in 1948 after Kimche was fired for disappearing from the office to Istanbul to negotiate the safe passage of two Jewish refugee ships through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.  In the first few years of the Attlee administration, ''Tribune'' became the focus for the Labour left's attempts to persuade  Ernest Bevin , the Foreign Secretary, to adopt a ""third force"" democratic socialist foreign policy, with Europe acting independently from the US and the Soviet Union, most coherently advanced in the pamphlet '' Keep Left  pamphlet  Keep Left ''  which was published by the rival '' New Statesman '' .  In 1948, however, after the Soviet rejection of  Marshall Aid  and the communist takeover of  Czechoslovakia , ''Tribune'' endorsed the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization  and took a strongly anti-communist line. ""The major threat to democratic socialism and the major danger of war in Europe arises from Soviet policy and not from American policy"", declared the editors in November 1948. ""It is not the Americans who have imposed a blockade on Berlin. It is not the Americans who have used conspiratorial methods to destroy democratic socialist parties in one country after another. It is not the Americans who have blocked effective action through one United Nations agency after another.""    Bevanism and CND   Foot remained in the editorial chair until 1952, when  Bob Edwards  British journalist  Bob Edwards  took over, but returned after losing his parliamentary seat in Plymouth in 1955. During the early 1950s, ''Tribune'' became the organ of the  Bevanite  left opposition to the  Labour Party  UK  Labour Party  leadership, turning against America over its handling of the Korean War then arguing strongly against West German rearmament and nuclear arms. ''Tribune'' remained critical of the Soviet Union, however  it denounced Stalin on his death in 1953, and in 1956 opposed the Soviet suppression of the  Hungarian Revolution of 1956 Hungarian Revolution  and the British government's  Suez  adventure. The paper and Bevan parted company after his ""naked into the conference chamber"" speech at the 1957 Labour Party conference  for the next five years ''Tribune'' was at the forefront of the campaign to commit Labour to a non-nuclear defence policy, ""the official weekly of the  Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ""  CND  as the direct actionists in the peace movement put it. CND's general secretary,  Peggy Duff , had been ''Tribune'' general manager. Among journalists on ''Tribune'' in the 1950s were  Richard Clements  journalist  Richard Clements ,  Ian Aitken  journalist  Ian Aitken  and  Mervyn Jones  UK journalist  Mervyn Jones , who related his experience on the paper in his autobiography ''Chances''.    The 1960s and 1970s   After Foot was re-elected to Parliament in 1960 for Bevan's old seat of  Ebbw Vale , Richard Clements became editor. During the 1960s and 1970s the paper faithfully expressed the ideas of the parliamentary Labour left and allied itself with the new generation of left-wing trade union leaders that emerged on the back of a wave of workplace militancy from the early 1960s onwards.  As such, it played a massive role in the politics of the time. Although it welcomed the election of Harold Wilson's Labour government in 1964—""Tribune takes over from Eton in the cabinet"", exclaimed a headline—the paper became rapidly disillusioned. It denounced the Wilson government's timidity on nationalisation and devaluation, opposed its moves to join the  European Communities   EC  and attacked it for failing to take a principled position against the  Vietnam War . It also backed the unions' campaigns against the government's prices-and-incomes policies and against '' In Place of Strife '', Barbara Castle's 1969 package of trade union law reforms.  The paper continued in the same vein after  Edward Heath  won the 1970 general election, opposing his Tory government's trade union legislation between 1970 and 1974 and placing itself at the head of opposition to Heath's negotiations for Britain to join the EEC. After Labour regained power in 1974, ''Tribune'' played a central part in the ""no"" campaign in  United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975 the 1975 referendum on British EEC membership .  However, ''Tribune'' in this period did not speak to, let alone represent, the concerns of the younger generation of leftists who were at the centre of the campaign against the Vietnam War and the post-1968 student revolt, who found the paper's reformism and commitment to Labour tame and old-fashioned. Circulation, around 20,000 in 1960, was said by 1980 to be around 10,000, but was in fact much less.    Brief support of Tony Benn   Clements resigned as editor in 1982 to become a political adviser to Foot  by now Labour leader , a role he continued under Foot's successor as Labour leader,  Neil Kinnock . Clements was succeeded in the ''Tribune'' chair by  Chris Mullin  politician  Chris Mullin , who steered the paper into supporting  Tony Benn   then just past the peak of his influence on the Labour left  and attempted to turn it into a friendly society in which readers were invited to buy shares, much to the consternation of the old Bevanite shareholders, most prominent among them  John Silkin  and  Donald Bruce, Baron Bruce of Donington Donald Bruce , who attempted unsuccessfully to take control of the paper. A protracted dispute ensued that at one point seemed likely to close the paper.  Communication Workers Union  UK  Communication Workers Union ,  Community  trade union  Community ,  T&GWU  but on 9 October it was announced that the magazine would close on the 31 October if a buyer could not be found. Unless a buyer could be found or a cooperative established, the last edition would have been published on 4 November. Oyston filed for bankruptcy and stopped publishing Tribune in January 2018. In August 2018, Jacobin publisher  Bhaskar Sunkara  confirmed the purchase of ''Tribune'' in media reports, stating that he aimed to relaunch the magazine ahead of the  Labour Party Conference  UK  Labour Party Conference  in September.  The group was reformed in 2005, led by  Clive Efford , MP for  Eltham . Invitations to join the newly reformed group were extended to backbench Labour MPs only..

NPR was founded in 1970 and PRI in 1983.  Many PRI shows draw a younger overall audience than shows produced by NPR. PRI's stated purpose is to offer a wider range of voices than NPR programs. APM was formed by Minnesota Public Radio to distribute programs it owned and produced, thereby moving distribution from PRI to APM.  In addition, PRI distributed '' World Cafe '' for many years, but in 2005, the show's distribution was switched to NPR. At the same time, PRI has also picked up the distribution of programs originally distributed by  NPR , including '' Michael Feldman's Whad'Ya Know? '', and, in 2006, '' Living on Earth ''— public radio 's leading news and information program focused on the environment. In September 2007, PRI became the national distributor of '' Selected Shorts '' which was previously distributed by NPR. In January 2014, PRI became the national distributor of '' Science Friday '', also previously distributed by NPR.

The motto of the organization is to provide a ""counterbalance to the Republican Tea Party"". On social media, Occupy Democrats was named the ""Most Influential Progressive Facebook Page"" by CrowdTangle in 2015 and by 2017 surpassed 7 million followers.In a 2017 feature on partisan news, BuzzFeed analyzed weekly Facebook engagements ""since the beginning of 2015 and found that Occupy Democrats on the left and Fox News on the right are the top pages in each political category."" The article added that the pages ""consistently generate more total engagement than the pages of major media outlets."" The organization received wide attention during the 2016 presidential primaries of the Democratic Party, and was credited for having helped ""build support"" for Bernie Sanders' candidacy.In a 2017 survey among US readers, it was voted the ""least trusted news source"" among American readers, just below Breitbart and BuzzFeed. In their news reporting, they shared a story on Facebook and other social media platforms about Senator Mitch McConnell's polio treatment that was unverified. In the same year, PolitiFact included Occupy Democrats in its list of fake news. In 2017 however, Politifact removed Occupy Democrats from its list of fake news sites and, according to the Miami New Times, ""admitted Occupy Democrats should never have been on the list in the first place."" In 2018, the English Wikipedia deprecated Occupy Democrats as a source of fact, ""due to its unreliability"".CNN mentioned Occupy Democrats in an online article about identifying misleading news, citing it as an example of a website using unverified photographs and videos. The example purported to show a female being ejected by police from a restroom for ""not looking like a woman"" due to a controversial law passed by North Carolina in March 2016, but Snopes.com found that the footage dated from at least 2015 and has no context as to where the woman is and why she was ejected.",References External links,2,3

In addition to the publication, ''AFA Journal'' articles are made available online. The journal reviews the content of prime-time television shows, categorizing them based on profanity, sex, violence, homosexuality, substance abuse, ""anti-Christian"" content, or "" political correctness "". The categorization is accompanied by short descriptions of the content of the episode under review. The review also lists the advertisers of each show and invites readers to contact the advertisers or television networks to express concern over program content.  Center for Law and Policy, the legal and political arm of the AFA, was shut down in 2007.  It specialized in First Amendment cases. The Center for Law and Policy lobbied legislative bodies, drafted legislation, and filed religious-discrimination lawsuits on behalf of individuals. In 1989 the AFA boycotted  Waldenbooks WaldenBooks  in an attempt to persuade the company to stop selling those same magazines. WaldenBooks responded with an advertisement campaign against censorship, asserting  First Amendment to the United States Constitution First Amendment  rights. WaldenBooks,  American Booksellers Association , the Council for Periodical Distributors Association, the International Periodical Distributors Association, and Duval Bibb Services launched a lawsuit against the AFA in October 1989, under the  Federal government of the United States Federal   Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act   RICO  and the  Florida Florida State  RICO Acts, which protect an organization's right to conduct business without harassment or threats.  During the summer of 1993 the AFA purchased full-page ads in '' The New York Times '', '' USA Today '', and '' Los Angeles Times '' denouncing the sexual and violent content of the upcoming  American Broadcasting Company ABC  police drama '' NYPD Blue ''. In December 2003, the company ""recalled the holiday catalog from all its stores, saying it needed the space on the counter for a new perfume"" and stated it would stop printing catalogs and start a new campaign.  In Spring 2005 the AFA launched a boycott of  Ford Motor Company Ford  for advertising in gay magazines, donating to  gay rights  organizations, and sponsoring  gay pride  celebrations. which had a director on the board of the  National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce . In October 2008, AFA announced the end of its boycott following the declaration to be ""neutral on same-sex marriage or any 'homosexual agenda' as defined by the American Family Association"" by McDonald's in a memo to franchisees.  In December 2008, the AFA issued an ""Action Alert""  In July 2012, they considered boycotting  Google  due to Google's "" Legalize Love "" campaign which supports  LGBT  rights. due to Target announcing they ""welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.""      Sexual morality     The AFA has repeatedly lobbied Congress to eliminate funding for the  National Endowment for the Arts .     View on media    Wildmon has been accused of saying that he believes Hollywood and the theater world are heavily influenced by  Jewish people , and that television network executives and advertisers have a genuine hostility towards Christians. the AFA released an ""Action Alert."" The Action Alert, entitled ""A first for America...The Koran replaces the Bible at swearing-in oath  What book will America base its values on, the Bible or the Koran?"", requested subscribers to write to their Congressional representatives and urge them to create a ""law making the Bible the book used in the swearing-in ceremony of representatives and senators."" that ""Permits should not be granted to build even one more mosque in the United States of America, let alone the monstrosity planned for Ground Zero. This is for one simple reason  each Islamic mosque is dedicated to the overthrow of the American government."" Fischer continued  ""Because of this subversive ideology, Muslims cannot claim religious freedom protections under the First Amendment.""  The AFA actively lobbies against the social acceptance of homosexual behavior  ""''We oppose the homosexual movement's efforts to convince our society that their behavior is normal''"" .  In 2000, vice president Tim Wildmon spoke out against  gay-straight alliance  clubs in schools, stating, ""We view these kinds of clubs as an advancement of the homosexual cause."" In 2012, the group started and then backed off from a failed campaign against the hiring of talk show host  Ellen DeGeneres  as a spokesperson for department store chain  JC Penney .  The organization has also criticized  GEICO  for a commercial showing  GEICO advertising campaigns#Maxwell the Pig Maxwell the Pig  in a car with a human girl, saying it suggests bestiality.     In God We Trust     File In God We Trust AFA Poster in New Philadelphia High School.jpg thumb A framed poster displaying the national motto of the United States in a  New Philadelphia High School  classroom  After the  September 11 attacks  in 2001, many public schools across the United States posted "" In God We Trust "" framed posters in their ""libraries, cafeterias and classrooms"". The American Family Association supplied several 11-by-14-inch posters to school systems and vowed to defend any legal challenges to the displaying of the posters. and stated that secular Jews often ""turn out to be the worst enemies of the country"" while the AFA's president Tim Wildmon stated ""Most of the Jews in this country, unfortunately, are far-left."" and stated that the  First Amendment to the United States Constitution  protects only the religious practice of Christianity, writing in a blog post ""The real object of the amendment was, not to countenance, much less to advance Mahometanism, or Judaism, or infidelity, by prostrating Christianity; but to exclude all rivalry among Christian sects... So the purpose of the First Amendment was most decidedly NOT to ""approve, support,  or  accept"" any ""religion"" other than Christianity.""  In a 2015 press release denouncing Fischer's views, the AFA stated ""AFA rejects the idea expressed by Bryan Fischer that ""Free exercise of religion"" only applies to Christians. Consequently, AFA rejects Bryan's assertions that Muslims should not be granted permits to build mosques in the United States."" is a co-author of '' The Pink Swastika ''  1995 , and  RenewAmerica  and later that year he repeated on American Family Talk that Hitler started the Nazi party ""in a gay bar in Munich"" In October, Bryan Fischer was taken off air during a CNN interview with Carol Costello for repeating his belief that ""Hitler recruited homosexuals around him to make up his Stormtroopers."" Fischer also reiterated his views on his radio show, and on video.  <blockquote>Supervisor Leslie Katz denounces your rhetoric against gays, lesbians and transgendered people. What happened to  Matthew Shepard  is in part due to the message being espoused by your groups that gays and lesbians are not worthy of the most basic equal rights and treatment. It is not an exaggeration to say that there is a direct correlation between these acts of discrimination, such as when gays and lesbians are called sinful and when major religious organizations say they can change if they tried, and the horrible crimes committed against gays and lesbians.</blockquote>  During the same time, the  San Francisco, California City and County of San Francisco  passed two resolutions. Resolution No. 234-99 ""calls for the Religious Right to take accountability for the impact of their long-standing rhetoric denouncing gays and lesbians, which leads to a climate of mistrust and discrimination that can open the door to horrible crimes such as those committed against  Equality Alabama#Gaither Mr. Gaither ""  In July 2000, the AFA sent out emails and letters calling for  Coming out openly gay   Arizona   Republican Party  United States  Republican   United States House of Representatives  member  Jim Kolbe  to be barred from speaking at the Republican National Convention. , the images were still on AFA's web site.&nbsp;– changed an AP profile of Olympic sprinter  Tyson Gay , rendering his name as "" Tyson Homosexual "".

''AFA Journal'' relied on testimony by two anonymous claimed teenage concertgoers. Mark Potok of the SPLC determined that the turning point was 2003's '' Lawrence v. Texas '', in which the  United States Supreme Court Supreme Court  struck down Texas's anti-sodomy laws. After that, the Christian right spent millions on advertisements, calling the list ""slanderous"". Jillian Rayfield of '' Talking Points Memo '' noted the irony in the website calling the SPLC a ""radical Left"" group ""spreading hateful rhetoric"" yet elsewhere declaring that the debates of the Christian right ""can and must remain civil&nbsp;– but they must never be suppressed through personal assaults that aim only to malign an opponent's character.""

'''WRAL-TV''',  virtual channel  5   ultra high frequency UHF   digital terrestrial television digital  channel 48 , is an  NBC - network affiliate affiliated   television station   city of license licensed  to  Raleigh, North Carolina Raleigh ,  North Carolina ,  United States  and serving the  Research Triangle Triangle  region  Raleigh– Durham, North Carolina Durham – Chapel Hill, North Carolina Chapel Hill – Fayetteville, North Carolina Fayetteville  . It is the  flagship  broadcasting  flagship station  of the locally based  Capitol Broadcasting Company , which has owned the station since its inception. WRAL-TV's studios are located at Capitol Broadcasting Company headquarters on Western Boulevard in West Raleigh, directly opposite the campus of  North Carolina State University , and its  transmitter  is located in  Auburn, North Carolina Auburn .  WRAL-TV is co-owned with  Fox Broadcasting Company Fox  affiliate  WRAZ  TV  WRAZ   channel 50, also licensed to Raleigh  and radio stations  WRAL-FM   101.5&nbsp;MHz ,  WCMC-FM   99.9&nbsp;MHz ,  WDNC   620&nbsp;kHz , and  WCLY   1550&nbsp;kHz . The operations of WRAZ and the radio stations are co-located at WRAL-TV's studios. WRAL-TV is available on  cable television cable  channel 3 in most of the Triangle, except in outlying areas of the market, where it is carried on channel 5. It is also available on cable in large portions of eastern areas of the state.  The station has been affiliated with NBC since February 29, 2016, when it ended a 30-year affiliation with  CBS   the CBS affiliation has since been picked up by  Goldsboro, North Carolina Goldsboro -licensed  WNCN , channel 17 . This is channel 5's second stint with NBC; it was affiliated with that network for six years at the station's inception, followed by a secondary affiliation with NBC for the next six years.    History       Early years    WRAL-TV began broadcasting on December 15, 1956. The first program aired was the  feature film movie  '' Miracle on 34th Street  1947 film  Miracle on 34th Street ''. A. J. Fletcher’s Capitol Broadcasting Company, which first licensed WRAL Radio  AM 1240, now  WPJL   in 1938, won the TV license in an upset over the much larger Durham Life Insurance Company, then-owners of radio station  WPTF . WRAL shared  American Broadcasting Company ABC  with WTVD until August 1, 1962, when channel 5 took the ABC affiliation full-time.  Within six months of the switch, WRAL-TV had become one of the strongest CBS affiliates in the country. It is one of the few stations in the country to have been a primary affiliate of all of the ""Big Three"" networks.  In December 1989, WRAL was knocked off the air when a severe  ice storm  caused the collapse of the station's  transmitter tower. Within hours, channel 5 cut a deal with the then-struggling Fayetteville  independent station  North America  independent station  WKFT-TV  channel 40, now  Univision  O&O  WUVC-DT  , allowing WRAL to return to the air in only three hours. WKFT ran the entire WRAL schedule during this time. The station's new, stronger tower was activated on October 25, 1990, at which point WKFT reverted to broadcasting its own programming.  In the early 1990s, WRAL distributed its programming via C-Band satellite as part of the  Primetime 24  package, reaching viewers in the  Caribbean  and  Latin America , as well as the few rural areas of the United States and  Canada  where local over-the-air broadcast signals were not available. It was replaced in the late 1990s with fellow CBS affiliate  WSEE-TV  from  Erie, Pennsylvania Erie ,  Pennsylvania  primarily because of preemptions of network programming due to  Atlantic Coast Conference ACC   college basketball basketball .     Return to NBC    On January 15, 2016, WRAL-TV announced that it would switch to NBC on February 29, 2016. Concurrently, CBS announced that the existing NBC station,  Media General -owned and  Goldsboro, North Carolina Goldsboro -licensed  WNCN   channel 17 , would replace WRAL-TV as the Triangle's CBS affiliate the same day.   Meredith College  professor Doug Spero suggested that WRAL's overall dominance in the Triangle was so absolute that it was in a position to become one of NBC's strongest affiliates, much as it was one of CBS' strongest affiliates. The feeling was mutual; according to  NBC News  correspondent  Harry Smith  US journalist  Harry Smith , NBC officials felt like they had ""just won the lottery"" when they learned WRAL was rejoining NBC.

The service broadcasts two subchannels, including a simulcast of WRAL's main programming in  1080p  high definition, and a demo loop of content in  4K resolution 4K   ultra high-definition television , along with testing for NBC involving the  2016 Summer Olympics  and  2018 Winter Olympics . The system allows emergency information including text, web pages and video to be distributed to compatible receivers using existing digital television signals. Today, ''Y&R'' continues to air at 4 p.m. on  WNCN , while WRAL-TV carries local news at the time slot.  When WRAL joined CBS in 1985, it became the Triangle's home for the  NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament , which has aired on CBS since 1981. Due to the Triangle's  and North Carolina's  longstanding status as a college basketball hotbed and local teams  North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball North Carolina  and  Duke Blue Devils men's basketball Duke  being fixtures in the tournament, NCAA Tournament games on WRAL were consistently among the highest-rated programs in the Triangle during tournament season. Despite the NCAA Tournament moving with the rest of the CBS schedule to WNCN, WRAL-TV continued to air ACC football and/or basketball.  WRAL has broadcast memorable locally produced children's programming throughout its storied history. Its most famous and longest-running is ''Time for Uncle Paul'', which ran from 1961 to 1981, and starred Paul Montgomery. He had played various other characters on other local shows before getting his own program. He voluntarily ended his program after station management suggested a change to an educational format.  Soon after, WRAL continued to produce acclaimed educational children's shows such as ''Frog Hollow'', ''Sparks'', and ''The Androgena Show''. Today, WRAL continues to produce educational programs with such shows as ''Smart Start Kids'' and ''Brain Game''. In recent years, WRAL and  UNC-TV  have co-produced programming, such as the 2009 Gubernatorial Inauguration and the 2006 Parade of Sail Tall Ship Show in  Beaufort, North Carolina Beaufort . UNC-TV has, also, begun carrying WRAL's award winning ''Focal Point'' documentaries. WRAL has long been a corporate supporter of UNC-TV, often assisting them financially and occasionally with on-air talent during UNC-TV's yearly Festival telethon.  WRAL announced on February 1, 2006 that it would begin to stream all of its programming live on the internet. This signified the latest advances in technology-driven delivery of product by a local television station. A few months later, WRAL was selected to be the flagship station for  North Carolina Education Lottery  drawings  twice daily for certain games, with the multi-jurisdictional  Mega Millions  Tuesday and Friday nights, and  Powerball  Wednesdays and Saturdays . On December 3, 2007, WRAL became the first local television station to stream live video to mobile phones. From 1995 through 2002, ''Football Friday'' was broadcast from WRAL's studio A with an audience of  cheerleading cheerleaders ,  marching band bands , players and fans. The arrival of the  North Carolina Education Lottery  moved the show to the newsroom. winning numerous regional Emmys. Most recently, WRAL and wral.com were nominated 29 times for Mid South Regional Emmys.  WRAL was the first commercial station to provide  High-definition television high definition  programming when it obtained an experimental HD transmission license from the FCC in 1996. Parent company Capitol Broadcasting along with the  A.J. Fletcher Foundation  were awarded the Governor's Award, the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' highest honor in 2012 as well.  In 1997 WRAL received eight Mid-South Regional Emmy Awards including those for news excellence, best newscast, best hard news series and investigative reporting.  In 2008, among the nine Emmy awards received by WRAL and WRAL.com received the inaugural award in Advanced Media for Interactivity for the video player used throughout the website.

Copies are also handed out to pedestrians.   ''Metro'' is owned by  Daily Mail and General Trust  plc  DMGT , part of the same media group as the '' Daily Mail '' and '' The Mail on Sunday '', but in some areas ''Metro'' operates as a  Franchising franchise  with a local newspaper publisher, rather than as a wholly owned concern. While being a sister paper to the  Conservatism conservative  ''Daily Mail'', the newspaper has never endorsed any political party or candidate, and claims to take a neutral political stance in its reporting. There were also reports in the late 1990s that both  Metro International  and  Rupert Murdoch 's  News International  were considering launching free newspapers in the UK which could be a commercial threat to  DMGT 's businesses.  Following several years of national expansion, in 2006 the newspaper's production was moved to  DMGT 's main newspaper offices at  Northcliffe House  in  Kensington , west London. Despite the increase in readership, that same year management also closed five regional ''Metro'' offices in Manchester, Glasgow, Newcastle, Birmingham and Bristol, which were responsible for producing regionalised arts, entertainment and food pages, citing ""challenging economic conditions"".      Launch of Irish edition    On 10 October 2005 ''Metro Ireland'' was launched in Dublin. It followed a legal battle over the title's name with the publishers of the ''Irish Independent'' and Dublin's ''Evening Herald'', which launched its own free newspaper called ''Herald AM''. The newspaper struck a reported £2.25 million deal with sportswear manufacturer  Adidas  to run cover wrap adverts on each of the 17 days of the Olympics.  In November 2016, comedian  Richard Herring  stepped down from writing his weekly column for ''Metro''. Fellow TV comedian  Dom Joly  later replaced him in the slot. In March 2018 ''Metro'' officially overtook '' The Sun  United Kingdom  The Sun '' in total print circulation, according to ABC   Audit Bureau of Circulations  UK    figures. The news section also features occasional feature columns from political pundits such as  Sophy Ridge  of  Sky News . Between 2001 and 2014 most print edition articles were published on this website, along with additional online-only content such as blogs and opinion columns.  In 2014 production of the newspaper and the website were separated.     Controversies     In the run-up to the  United Kingdom general election, 2015 , the-then  UK Independence Party  leader  Nigel Farage  refused to be interviewed by ''Metro'' after accusing the newspaper of being biased against his party. This was denied by the newspaper's editor. All other national party leaders agreed to be interviewed, including Conservative prime minister  David Cameron  and Labour leader  Ed Miliband . Questions were subsequently raised as to why the  Democratic Unionist Party  placed an advert in ''Metro'', because the newspaper does not publish in Northern Ireland.  In 2005  Rupert Murdoch  said he was ""worried"" by competition from ''Metro'' and that it had damaged the circulation of his own newspaper ''The Sun''.

Washington, DC , that investigates and works to expose waste, fraud, abuse, and conflicts of interest in the  Federal government of the United States U.S. federal government . The Project first gained widespread attention in the early 1980s for publishing reports on ""outrageously overpriced military spending,"" including a $7,600 coffee maker and a $436 hammer.  Other watchdog organizations have folded into POGO over the years. In 2012, the Straus Military Reform Project of the  Center for Defense Information  joined POGO.  The organization is funded through grants from a variety of foundations, as well as private donations. POGO's database was the inspiration for a similar federal government database that was created by the 2009 National Defense Authorization Act. POGO won the lawsuit in 2005. Since then, POGO has hosted monthly training, as well as specialized training upon request, according to the organization's website. Following this report and others by the federal  Government Accountability Office , the royalty in-kind program was terminated, and MMS was split into three different bureaus. LANL has been the subject of several controversies in the past, including employees charging personal expenses to government accounts, Both Yaz and Yasmin have been linked to fatal blood clots in some users. POGO and other organizations claimed in 2012 that the  United States Navy U.S. Navy  and  United States Marine Corps Marine Corps  hid information about the nature and extent of the contamination, citing a report released by the  Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  that was redacted by the Navy. Some of the weapons systems that POGO has been critical of include the  littoral combat ship , Wheeler retired in 2015. When these accusations led to a congressional investigation of Bloch, Bloch allegedly hired a technology company to wipe the memory of his computer and several other OSC laptops in order to hide key evidence from the investigators. Bloch initially claimed that he ordered this as protection against a virus that had infected his computer, but he later admitted he was trying to withhold information. POGO was awarded about $1.2 million from the settlements in 1998. That year, POGO shared its settlement with two federal employee whistleblowers, saying the payment was a ""Public Service Award"" to the whistleblowers. While calling the payments a ""mistake"" on POGO's part, U.S. Senator  Jeff Bingaman  disputed the agency's report, saying that it did not provide any evidence that the payments were improper. Young later withdrew the charge, lacking the votes for passage.

The Progress immediately became the group's flagship paper, and Worrell moved his newspaper group headquarters to Charlottesville.  Faced with major newspaper industry change, in 1995 Worrell sold his newspaper properties to Richmond-based Media General, which was later purchased by Nexstar Media Group, as a part of a larger $230M deal.  In the 21st century, Media General sold the Progress' printing press, and reorganized its operations to print multiple newspapers from other printing plants it controlled.

It closed in 2001. It covers Orange County's growing Hispanic community, which now numbers over a million. Julio Saenz is the editor and general manager.  In 1999, Threshie became Chairman of the Board of Freedom Communications, and N. Christian Anderson III assumed the position of publisher and  chief executive officer .      2000s    Ken Brusic was named vice president of content and executive editor in April 2002. The trial was not deemed a success, and since then editing has been done by the ''Register'' in Orange County. In spring of 2009,  Freedom Communications  instituted furloughs for all employees nationwide, followed by a permanent 5% pay cut starting in July 2009. News reports in August 2009 indicated that Freedom Communications planned to file for bankruptcy and turn control of its publications, including ''The Orange County Register'', over to its lenders. In the column, The papers continued to operate under the Freedom Communications name.  On April 16, 2014, the ''Orange County Register'' launched the ''Los Angeles Register'', ""more a print play than a digital one"" serving  Los Angeles County . It was the first time since the '' Los Angeles Herald-Examiner Herald-Examiner '' folded on November 1, 1989, that a main competitor to the '' Los Angeles Times '' was launched, this time intended to be ""as local as one edition can be for the entire county.""  On February 12, 2016, Freedom Communications announced that the ''Orange County Register'' and the ''Press-Enterprise'' along with its websites, community weeklies and the two Spanish-Language weeklies ''Excelsior'' in Orange County and ''La Prensa'' in the Inland Empire, were being placed in a ""stalking horse"" auction after the company declared bankrupt at the end of 2015. Both Digital First Media and Tribune Publishing were the bidders. The auction started on March 21 and was completed on March 31, 2016. On March 21, 2016,  Digital First Media  acquired both the ''Orange County Register'' and the ''Press-Enterprise'' for $52.3 million in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court in  Santa Ana, California Santa Ana . The U.S. Department of Justice blocked the sale of Freedom Communications to  Tribune Publishing  because it would create a newspaper monopoly in both Orange and Riverside Counties. Los Angeles News Group was renamed Southern California News Group on March 31, 2016, once the sale of Freedom Communications to Digital First Media was completed. It has 11 paid regional dailies, and community weeklies serving the South Bay communities of Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach and Palos Verdes Peninsula, the Long Beach neighborhoods north and east of downtown and over 20 community weeklies in Orange County, as well as the Spanish-language weeklies ''Impacto USA'' and ''Unidos'', now consolidated as ''Excelsior'', which will have three editions for Los Angeles County, Orange County and Inland Empire.

In June 2000, one of the main NGOs dedicated to development published a report titled Tax Havens  “Unlocking the hidden billions to eradicate poverty”. The creation of the Tax Justice Network was in part a consequence of the publication of that report. In the United States, the Citizens for Tax Justice Organization has undertaken a similar effort, although with a national focus. On the contrary, TJN focuses primarily on the international level.  Since 2000, ATTAC, which was born in France in support of the called Tobin tax, has become a movement of international pressure that faces the problems of tax fraud, financial crime and the abuse of tax havens. In April 2005, ATTAC-Spain asked the Government not to recognize the fictitious and instrumental companies registered in tax havens before the Spanish legal system. And ATTAC-Germany played a decisive role in the creation of Tax Justice Network, whose diffusion is spreading in the Spanish-speaking countries.  Until recently, international fiscal policy was hardly a field for civil campaigns, as can be demonstrated by an example. In June 2003, the G8 meeting in Evian summoned 300,000 demonstrators in Geneva, 3,000 people registered to pressure the delegates and Geneva came to a standstill. In December 2003 the UN Committee of Fiscal Experts met in Geneva and TJN was the only civil society organization that attended and intervened in the meeting.    Functions and objectives.   The main purpose is     Empirical results    In March 2005, TJN published the results of an investigation that demonstrated $ 11.5 trillion of the personal wealth of wealthy individuals held in offshore financial centers. In addition, to minimize taxes or to avoid paying them, a large proportion of this wealth is managed in about 70 tax havens. If the income from this wealth patrimony will pay the taxes in the countries where these rich individuals reside or where they obtain their wealth, the additional tax collection available for the financing of public services and for investment in the whole world would be around 255,000 million of annual dollars. We emphasize that this estimate of the loss of tax revenues does not include the tax evasion of transnational corporations or the reduction of tax revenues caused by tax competition.

In January 2011, Eurasia Group's top risk was the  G-Zero world , where ""the world's major powers set aside aspirations for global leadership—alone, coordinated, or otherwise—and look primarily inward for their policy priorities. Key institutions that provide global governance become arenas not for collaboration but for confrontation"".  In January 2013, Eurasia Group announced that ""the era of emerging market abundance is finished"", and listed volatility in  emerging markets  as the year's top risk. The report breaks down emerging markets into those ""becoming developed"", ""still emerging--and problematically so"", and ""backsliding"", and outlined the downside risk of markets in each category. Also listed in the report as top risks were  in order  ""China v. information"", ""Arab summer"", ""Washington Politics"", ""JIBs - Japan, Israel and Britain"", ""Europe"", ""East Asian geopolitics"", ""Iran"", ""India"", and ""South Africa.""  In 2015, the Top Risk was ""The Politics of Europe"". The report stated, ""Europe's economics are in substantially better shape than at the height of the Eurozone crisis, but the politics is now much worse...That's true on three different levels  bottom-up, intra-EU, and outside-in.""  In 2016, the group predicted that the trend toward a world without a global leader would continue in 2017 in their forecast for the year. They described it as ""a period of geopolitical recession"", and wrote that the continued ""populist revolt"" against globalism was evidenced by the United Kingdom's departure from the EU   Brexit   and the collapse of the  Trans-Pacific Partnership , among other events of 2016.

File Express Building.jpg thumb 200px right Exterior of  Daily Express Building, London Daily Express Building  in London, designed by Ellis and Clark. The ''Daily Express'' was founded in 1900 by  Sir Arthur Pearson, 1st Baronet Sir Arthur Pearson , with the first issue appearing on 24 April 1900. Its success was partly due to aggressive marketing campaign and a circulation war with other populist newspapers.   The ruralist author  Henry Williamson  wrote for the paper on many occasions for half a century, practically the whole of his career. It opened a similar building in Glasgow in 1936 in Albion Street. Glasgow printing ended in 1974 In the same month,  Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh the Duke of Edinburgh  described the ''Express'' as ""a bloody awful newspaper. It is full of lies, scandal and imagination. It is a vicious paper.""  The ''Daily Express'' switched from  broadsheet  to tabloid in 1977     Richard Desmond era     File Chancellor George Osborne and Richard Desmond.jpg thumb In 2000, Express Newspapers was bought by  Richard Desmond   ''left''   In 2000, Express Newspapers was bought by Richard Desmond, publisher of celebrity magazine '' OK! '', for £125 million. Controversy surrounded the deal since Desmond also owned  softcore pornography  magazines. Since payments to the NPA fund the  Press Complaints Commission , it is possible that the ''Express'' and its sister papers could cease being regulated by the PCC. The chairman of the  Press Standards Board of Finance , which manages PCC funds, described Express Newspapers as a ""rogue publisher"".  The Express group lost prominent libel cases in 2008–2009; it paid damages to people involved in the  Disappearance of Madeleine McCann Madeleine McCann  case  see below , a member of the  Muslim Council of Britain , footballer  Marco Materazzi , and sports agent  Willie McKay . The losses led the media commentator  Roy Greenslade  to conclude that Express Newspapers  which also publishes the ''Star'' titles  paid more in libel damages over that period than any other newspaper group. Although most of the individual amounts paid were not disclosed, the total damages were recorded at £1,570,000. Greenslade characterised Desmond as a ""rogue proprietor"".  In early 2008, a previous cost-cutting exercise triggered the first 24-hour national press strike in the UK for 18 years. In late August 2009 came plans for a further 70 redundancies, affecting journalists across Express Newspapers  including the ''Daily'' and ''Sunday Express'', the ''Daily Star'', and the ''Daily Star Sunday'' .  In May 2010, Desmond announced a commitment of £100&nbsp;million over five years to buy new equipment for the printing plants, beginning with the immediate purchase of four new presses, amid industry rumours that he was going to establish a printing plant at Luton.  On 31 December 2010, the Express, with all the media titles in Desmond's  Northern & Shell  group, were excluded from the  Press Complaints Commission  after withholding payment.  In September 2017, '' Daily Mirror '' publisher  Trinity Mirror  announced its interest in buying all of Express Newspapers from Desmond. The '' Financial Times '' called it potentially the biggest change in the British newspaper industry for a decade. It is edited by Michael Booker. Its circulation in February 2019 was 272,259. The press, ""egged on by police leaks, unanimously declared Adams guilty,"" except for  Percy Hoskins , chief crime reporter for the ''Express''.  The article provoked complaints, leading to a front-page apology a  fortnight  later, In 2006 and 2007, these front-page stories consistently appeared on Mondays, and ended only when the paper focused instead on the  Madeleine McCann  story  see below .   Even on 7 July 2006, the anniversary of the  7/7 London bombings   used by most other newspapers to publish commemorations  the front page was given over to Diana. This tendency was also mocked on '' Have I Got News for You '' when on 6 November 2006, the day other papers reported the death sentence given to  Saddam Hussein  on their front pages, the ''Express'' led with ""SPIES COVER UP DIANA 'MURDER'"".  According to '' The Independent '' ""The Diana stories appear on Mondays because Sunday is often a quiet day."" but said coverage needed to be toned down since daily headlines were not necessarily helpful.  In a settlement at the  High Court of Justice , the newspapers ran a front-page apology to the McCanns on 19 March 2008, another apology on the front of the Sunday editions of 23 March and a statement of apology at the High Court. The newspapers also agreed to pay costs and damages, which the McCanns said they would use to fund the search for their daughter. This was followed in October by an apology and payout  forwarded to the fund again  to a group who had become known as the "" Tapas Seven "" in relation to the case.  Appearing in April 2018 before a home affairs select committee that is investigating the treatment of minority groups in print media, ''Daily Express'' editor Gary Jones said that he would be looking to change the tone of the paper. Jones said that he had found past pages of the newspaper “downright offensive,” adding that they made him feel “very uncomfortable” and contributed to an “Islamophobic sentiment” in the media.  the newspaper has declared its support for the  Conservative Party  UK  Conservative Party  at every general election since  World War II , until 2015 where they began supporting the  UK Independence Party . The campaign attracted the support of many celebrities including sportsman/TV personality Sir  Ian Botham  who both gave interviews for 8 January's special edition of the paper. The first week of the campaign saw a response of around 370,000 signatures being received  just over 50% of daily readership or around 0.6% of the UK population .

History and major initiatives       Early years     File The heritage foundation building on mass. ave.jpg thumb right upright 1.05 The Heritage Foundation's headquarters building, on  Massachusetts Avenue  Washington, D.C.  Massachusetts Avenue  on  Capitol Hill .  The Heritage Foundation was founded on February 16, 1973 by  Paul Weyrich ,  Edwin Feulner , and  Joseph Coors . Reagan liked the ideas so much that he gave a copy to each member of his cabinet to review.  Heritage also  advocacy advocated  the development of new  ballistic missile  defense systems for the United States. Reagan adopted this as his top defense priority in 1983, calling it the  Strategic Defense Initiative . In domestic policy, the Bush administration agreed with six of the ten budget reforms contained in ''Mandate for Leadership III'' and included them in their 1990 budget proposal. Heritage also became involved in the  culture war s of the 1990s with the publication of ""The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators"" by  William Bennett . The Index documented how crime, illegitimacy, divorce, teenage suicide, drug use and fourteen other social indicators had become measurably worse since the 1960s. and changes by Malaysia ""moving in the right economic and political direction.""  Pundits predicted his tenure would bring a sharper, more politicized edge to the Foundation. was criticized for what critics called an overly narrow definition of poverty. Criticism was published in opinion editorials in '' The New Republic '', '' The Nation '', the  Center for American Progress , and '' The Washington Post ''. Notably, outlets like '' Reason Magazine '' and the  Cato Institute  criticized the report for failing to employ  dynamic scoring  despite Heritage's support for such methodology in analyzing other policy proposals.  In September 2015, the Foundation stated publicly that it had been targeted by  Hacker  computer security  hackers  and had experienced a breach in which donors' information was taken. '' The Hill  publication  The Hill '' publication compared the attack to  Office of Personnel Management data breach another notable data breach  at the  Office of Personnel Management  a few months before. The identity of those that attacked the Foundation and their motivations are unknown.  Heritage has hosted many influential foreign and domestic political leaders since its founding, including members of  United States Congress Congress , foreign heads of state, and U.S. presidents. On November 1, 2007, President George W. Bush visited Heritage to defend his appointment of  Michael Mukasey  to succeed  Alberto Gonzales  as  Attorney General of the United States ; Mukasey's nomination faced opposition in the  United States Senate U.S. Senate  over the nominee's refusal to label the interrogation tactic of  waterboarding  as illegal.  This was also the model for  Mitt Romney 's health care plan in Massachusetts. and was the first presidential debate to be sponsored by either Heritage or AEI.    Publications and activities   Heritage's 1981 book of policy analysis, '' Mandate for Leadership '', was a landmark in advocacy for limited government. At 1,000-plus pages, ''Mandate for Leadership'' offered specific recommendations on policy, budget and administrative action for all Cabinet departments.  Until 2001, the Heritage Foundation published '' Policy Review '', a public policy journal, which was then acquired by the  Hoover Institution . From 1995 to 2005, the Heritage Foundation ran  Townhall.com , a conservative website that was subsequently acquired by  Camarillo, California -based  Salem Communications . The chart relies on 42 visual images to convey its data, which Heritage makes available to the public for free distribution.  Under Jim DeMint's leadership, the process involved in publishing policy papers changed at the Heritage Foundation.  In 2002, Heritage began publishing its annual Index of Dependence report on the growth of federal government programs that constrain private sector or local government alternatives and impact the dependence of individuals on the federal government. It examines programs in five broad categories  housing; health care and welfare; retirement; higher education; and rural and agricultural services. including reporting on a 15-cent Christmas Tree tax proposed by the Obama administration. Following a Heritage blog post by  David Addington  that was critical of the tax, the story was reported by  ABC News , and according to  Fox News , this criticism in the media led to a delay in the implementation of the tax. According to Bluey, the meetings were launched to provide conservative bloggers with greater understanding of conservative policy debates and a forum to discuss ideas, as there was then no regular meeting of people involved in the conservative blogosphere. Scribe is part of a trend of ""think tank journalism"" The Heritage Foundation has hosted viewings of this film, followed by panel discussions. According to conservative commentator  Michael Barone  pundit  Michael Barone , the debate was ""probably the most substantive and serious presidential debate of this election cycle."" Thatcher herself maintained a long relationship with The Heritage Foundation. Shortly after leaving office, Thatcher was honored by Heritage at a  September 1991 dinner.  Heritage's total revenue for 2011 was $72,170,983 and its expenses were $80,033,828. This is not a focus of the modern Foundation which has endorsed controversial  Citizens United  effectively removing such controls.    Notable Board of Trustees members      Thomas A.

One of the initial board members was author  James Dale Davidson  who edited a financial newsletter. Davidson's co-editor,  William Rees-Mogg Lord Rees-Mogg , former editor of '' The Times '' and  Board of Governors of the BBC Vice Chair of the BBC , later became chairman of Newsmax.  In 2008, a profile in '' The Palm Beach Post '' on Newsmax and founder Ruddy indicated the company generated revenues of approximately $25 million per year, and, according to the company, has been profitable for the past five years. In a 2009  Forbes .com interview, Internet expert Nathan Richardson was asked to identify the ""smartest thing on the web"" today. Richardson identified Newsmax, among several websites, citing its success ""monetizing the web.""  In a January 2010 profile on the company, the '' Financial Times '' reported that the ""Rise of Newsmax Defies the Media Trend"" and said its website, Newsmax.com, is ""one of the strongest conservative voices online"". The paper said Newsmax had witnessed 40 percent growth rates per annum over the past decade and closed 2009 with $35 million revenues, up from $24 million the year before.  A 2010 '' New York Post '' story reported that the paper's long-time former  editor , Kenneth Chandler, was tapped as ''Newsmax Magazine's''  editor-in-chief . CEO Ruddy also told the ''Post'' the company expected annual 2010 revenues to exceed $50 million.  As of May 2018, the Qatari government has been seeking to acquire a major stake in ''Newsmax'' in order to ""to win friends and clout in the United States as it struggle[s] to respond to a Trump-endorsed  2017–18 Qatar diplomatic crisis blockade  by its Arab neighbors.""  Alexa Internet  statistics for Newsmax.com indicate that the readership consists mainly of Internet users over the age of 45, which aligns itself to the average age of Republican leaning voters, as gathered by  The Pew Research Center .  The company has increasingly attracted national and international leaders to its  West Palm Beach, Florida  headquarters. Former President  Bill Clinton , who describes Newsmax's  CEO  Ruddy as a friend, made headlines when he visited Newsmax's offices during the summer of 2010. According to the magazine, Newsmax is a major player in GOP politics, as seen during the 2012 primaries.  In March 2014, Newsmax was profiled in  Bloomberg Businessweek  by correspondent  Karl Taro Greenfeld . The  Bloomberg Businessweek  story detailed Newsmax's successful business model of targeting higher-incomed  Baby boomers . The average age of a Newsmax online reader is 54.7 years of age. The profile detailed Newsmax's plans to launch a linear and  Over-the-top content Over-the-top  OTT  content  cable channel, and suggested their revenue model which sells ""a smorgasbord of political, health, and financial information, self-help books, and even vitamin supplements"" could make the company uniquely competitive in this arena.    Evaluation of content   The website Media Bias - Fact Check, evaluated Newsmax as having an editorial ""right bias,"" rating its reporting as ""...mostly factual and sources properly, but sometimes takes news out of context and is therefore mixed for factual reporting."" It rated its sidebar, ""Around the Web"" as constituting ""...nothing more than deceptive advertising that looks like news links and leads to fake pseudo-science information and products.""    Contributors   Newsmax has a sizable stable of news  correspondent s and  editorialist s, including  George Will ,  John Gizzi ,  Lanny Davis , and  Alan Dershowitz .

History      Early years    The beginnings of the Providence Journal Company started on January 3, 1820, when publisher ""Honest"" John Miller started the ''Manufacturers' & Farmers' Journal, Providence & Pawtucket Advertiser'' in Providence, published twice per week.     Knowles, Anthony & Danielson    During the years 1863 to 1884 the Journal was published by Knowles, Anthony & Danielson. During the Danielson/Anthony years, the paper was solidly allied with textile mill owners and big business, and frequently gave support to nativist anti-Irish Catholic sentiment. It is possible this was an early inspiration for Dow's later development of his "" S&P Dow Jones Indices stock index "" at the  Wall Street Journal . In contrast to Danielson and Anthony, Williams had a sympathetic appreciation for the Irish culture. Still, Rathom remained editor until his death in 1923.  In 1937, the only competing Providence-based daily, the ''Star-Tribune'', went bankrupt and was sold. The Providence Journal company bought it and kept it running for four months, then shut it down. One source passed on to White evidence that President Richard Nixon had paid taxes amounting to $792.81 in 1970 and $878.03 in 1971, despite earning more than $400,000. White would later recall rolling the story out of his typewriter, folding it up and putting it in his wallet. the Journal renamed its website providencejournal.com, a move which meant that most of the previously Internet links to its content no longer worked. It also began implementing a system to require online readers to pay for content. Interactive images of its newspaper pages were initially available on personal computers and the iPad for free. The paywall was put in place on February 28, 2012. The new website was part of a larger rebranding project by  Nail Communications  which also included a campaign entitled ""We Work For The Truth"". The company said it wanted to focus on business interests in Dallas. Workers were not surprised because the announcement came after the company sold one of its other papers, the Riverside Press-Enterprise in California. The sale was completed on Sept. 3, 2014, as several employees, including widely respected columnist Bob Kerr, were told they would not be transferred to the new company.  Bernie Szachara, senior vice president for publishing and group publisher at Local Media Group, a division of GateHouse Media, assumed the title of interim publisher, succeeding Howard G. Sutton.    Headquarters   The paper in its early days changed headquarters frequently as the paper grew. In 1823 it moved to the Union building, on the west side of the bridge, and in the following year to the Granite building, Market Square.   In 1950, editor Sevellon Brown and reporter  Ben Bagdikian  received Honorable Mention from the  Peabody Awards  for a series of commentaries and criticisms of broadcasts by  Walter Winchell    In 1974, reporter Jack White won a Pulitzer Prize in National Reporting for investigating President Richard Nixon's Federal income tax payments in 1970 and 1971.   In 1997, the  Livingston Award , sometimes called the ""Pulitzer Prize for the Young,""    Notable contributors       Henry B. Anthony     Ben Bagdikian     C. J.

It is $4 on Sundays.    Volume numbering   Through the paper's long history, there have been some inconsistencies in its volume numbering. In 1972, when the Saturday editions of the ''Journal'' and ''Bulletin'' were combined to create the ''Journal-Bulletin'', the Saturday edition was reset to become Volume 1, Number 1.

The Journal bills itself as ""America's oldest daily newspaper in continuous publication"", a distinction that comes from the fact that The Hartford Courant, started in 1764, did not become a daily until 1837 and the New York Post, which began daily publication in 1801, had to suspend publication during strikes in 1958 and 1978.The paper's history has reflected the waxing and waning of newspaper popularity throughout the United States.

In January 2002 the ruling was decided in the FFRF's favor; that receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in public money is in violation of the Establishment Clause. The judge wrote ""Because I find that the Department of Workforce Development's grant to Faith Works constitutes unrestricted, direct funding of an organization that engages in religious indoctrination, I conclude that this funding stream violates the establishment clause."" In January 2005, the court vacated HHS's funding of this group citing ""federal funds have been used by the MentorKids program to advance religion in violation of the Establishment Clause"". The parties later agreed to a dismissal of that claim, but additional counts within the lawsuit, alleging separate violations, continued.      Religious displays on public property     In December 2007 the FFRF, on behalf of a group of concerned Green Bay residents and invoking the First Amendment rights of all of the city's residents, sued the city because of the placement of a nativity scene at Green Bay's city hall. Before the case was heard, the city removed the nativity scene. The judge then dismissed the suit, citing lack of jurisdiction. Since the nativity scene already was removed and a moratorium imposed on future such displays, there remained no basis for continued dispute. He went on to say, ""''the plaintiffs have already won''. ...the Plaintiffs have won a concrete victory that changes the circumstances on the ground.""  In September 2011, the FFRF, along with the  American Civil Liberties Union   ACLU , sued the  Giles County, Virginia  school district on behalf of anonymous plaintiffs. A display of the  Ten Commandments  had been placed beside a copy of the U.S. Constitution at Giles County public schools. Prior to the suit, in January and June 2011, the FFRF and the ACLU had sent letters to the school board requesting removal of the display. The school superintendent ordered that the displays of the Ten Commandments be removed. The Giles County school board met in June 2011 and voted to overturn the superintendent's decision to remove the display. The city refused to do so. The FFRF states that it is currently looking for a plaintiff in the area to represent for a suit,  In August 2012 the FFRF, on behalf of a resident, threatened a lawsuit challenging a Latin cross that had been displayed on top of the water tower of  Whiteville, Tennessee . After the FFRF wrote three initial letters, but before the lawsuit was filed, the town removed one arm of the cross. The Forest Service continued to grant renewals of the permit until 2010. When the Service declined to renew, the Knights declined to remove the statue citing ""tradition"" and the ""historical"" value of the statue.      Prayer in government/schools      In October 2008, the FFRF filed suit against the U.S. government over the statute establishing the  National Day of Prayer   NDoP . In 2010, Federal judge  Barbara Brandriff Crabb  ruled it  unconstitutional  as it is ""an inherently religious exercise that serves no secular function"". This ruling was appealed by the U.S. government. In April 2011, the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the FFRF's challenge to the NDoP, holding that the FFRF did not have standing to challenge the NDoP statute or proclamations and that only the President was injured enough to challenge the NDoP statute.     Internal Revenue Service         Parish exemption     The FFRF filed suit against the IRS over the parish exemption that allows ""ministers of the gospel"" to claim part of their salary as an income-tax-free housing allowance. This was originally filed in 2009, in California, In January 2014, the Department of Justice filed an appeal in federal court.      990 Form     In December 2012 the FFRF filed suit against the IRS for not requiring the yearly filing of a 990 Form for religious institutions, which is required for all other non-profit organizations.     Illinois    On December 23, 2009, William J. Kelly, conservative activist and candidate for Illinois Comptroller, attempted to remove a FFRF sign at a holiday display.   In 2013, a natural nativity featuring  Charles Darwin ,  Albert Einstein  and  Mark Twain  as the three wise men, the  Statue of Liberty  and an astronaut as angels and an African American girl baby doll to represent that ""humankind was birthed in Africa"" was added.     Dayton, Tennessee     On July 14, 2017, a statue of  Clarence Darrow  was unveiled in  Dayton, Tennessee  on the  Rhea County Courthouse  lawn, funded by a $150,000 donation from the FFRF. The courthouse was the site of the historic 1925  Scopes Monkey Trial  wherein Darrow unsuccessfully defended a teacher,  John T. Scopes , who was found guilty of teaching evolution in a public school in violation of what was then a Tennessee state law. The statue was placed just a few feet away from a statue of  William Jennings Bryan , Darrow's  creationist  opponent in the trial, which had been erected in 2005 by nearby  Bryan College . A letter of complaint was sent. After it was decided that the nativity scene would remain, the FFRF petitioned to have its own banner placed on the site, but county officials declined to discuss its placement. The FFRF banner was placed without permission on the courthouse property, but was soon removed.    Conventions   FFRF has held conventions since 1977, one year after the group formed and one year prior to its official incorporation. The 2016 convention was the 39th annual convention.    Emperor Has No Clothes Award   The ''Emperor Has No Clothes Award'' has been awarded by the Foundation since 1999 in recognition of ""plain speaking"" on the shortcomings of religion by public figures.

The organization's focus includes election reform, voter rights and voter registration, civic engagement, financial reform, and sustainable economics.    History   In the late 1990s, Demos was conceptualized by  Charles Halpern , President of the  Nathan Cummings Foundation   1989–2000 .  Halpern wanted to create a counter-argument to the growing influence of the many right-wing think tanks and establish a multi-issue organization that would focus on progressive policy development and advocacy.  David Callahan , a Fellow at the Century Foundation, and  Stephen B. Heintz Stephen Heintz , Vice-President of the  EastWest Institute , joined Halpern in helping to found Demos. Founding Board members included Arnie Miller, of Isaccson Miller, an executive search firm;  David Skaggs , a Colorado Congressman; and  Barack Obama , then an Illinois State Senator.  In March 2000, Demos opened its first office in New York with  Stephen B. Heintz Stephen Heintz  as President. In this first year, Demos’ work focused on two issues   1  economic inequities in America and the growing prosperity gap and  2  increasing civic participation and developing a more inclusive democracy. These two areas continue to be a large part of Demos’ core work. Demos’ work became especially relevant after the 2000 Presidential Election’s voter complications increased concern about the efficacy America’s election systems.  In 2001, Stephen Heintz stepped down and was replaced by Miles Rapoport, Connecticut legislator  1985–94  and Secretary of State  1995–98  with a background in social-change advocacy and community-building.  In March 2014, Rapoport left Demos to become the President of  Common Cause . Demos currently has three broad goals  1. Achieving true democracy by reducing the role of money in politics and guaranteeing the freedom to vote 2. Creating pathways to ensure a diverse, expanded middle class in a new, sustainable economy, and 3. Transforming the public narrative to elevate the values of community and racial equity.     Campaigns and Partnerships    The Campaigns and Partnerships Team at Demos contains three programs.   •	Through Campaigns we seek short-to-medium victories on key democracy and economic justice issues in close collaboration with allies.  •	Through Partnerships we build long-term, transformational relationships and pursue strategic movement interventions with national and state-level allies to align and pursue our shared vision for change.  •	Our Political program works to ensure Demos is a key resource for groups mobilizing unprecedented civic participation in this “resistance” climate; and through Demos Action works to build the long term progressive governing power necessary to achieve our multi-racial populist economic and pro-democracy agenda.   The team works with more than 30 partners on campaigns as part of our Inclusive Democracy Project and is a leading member in many strategic coalitions. The program aims to reduce big money in politics, make voting more accessible, build transformation power for the New American Demos, and transform the public dialogue to one that demands equal opportunity and voice to everyone regardless of their race, where they live, or how much money they have.  Demos works to ensure democratic and economic reform is driven by people of color led grassroots organizations.  Among our partners   •	In New York, Demos works with Community Voices Heard, which is a multi-racial organization made up primarily of women of color and low-income families in New York State.  •	Demos supports the Working Families Party in Maryland, which as its name suggests fights for the state’s working families  •	And Olé New Mexico wants to enrich and empower their states families who work hard.     Litigation    Demos is involved in voting rights litigation and advocacy across the country from New York to Arizona, and in places like Ohio and Tennessee related to failure of states and counties to update voter registrations, voter roll purging, language access, and felony disenfranchisement. Their work affects millions of voters. Their lawsuits include   •	In Florida in one of the largest lawsuits of its kind, Demos asked a federal judge to order the state of Florida and local election officials to provide Spanish-language ballot materials in 32 counties that have sizable Puerto Rican populations, who are protected under the Voting Rights Act. There are 143,000 voting age citizens of Puerto Rican descent in the counties. Untold numbers were displaced to the state after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico. The judge ruled in Demos’ favor.  •	In Arizona, Demos filed a lawsuit against the Secretary of State for blatant voting rights violations. The state’s failure to update voter registration addresses threatens to deprive thousands of Arizonans of the right to vote. As many of 500,000 Arizonans voters could be affected. Separately, Demos is negotiating with state public assistance agencies, like those that provide food benefits and cash assistance to families, provide voter registration opportunities as required by federal law.  •	Demos filed a lawsuit against Missouri for failing to comply with federal voting rights law that ensures Missourians have access to voter registration and that their registration records are accurately updated. In 2016, more than 750,000 people moved within Missouri—245,000 to another county. Every time one of these individuals reported a change of address with the state motor vehicle agency, their voter registration information should have been updated to reflect their new address unless they requested otherwise.  •	Demos’ case Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute went to the Supreme Court, and it was one of the more consequential decisions of the term.  Ruling 5-4 against Demos, the high court found that the process by which Ohio removed voters from the polls – targeting citizens who hadn’t voted in two years and purging them if they did not respond to a mailed notice or to vote over the next two federal election cycles – did not violate the National Voter Registration Act. As The New Yorker’s Jeffrey Toobin noted, “Lawmakers in Republican-controlled states will see the Husted decision as an invitation, hydraulic in its force, to launch even more invasive purges of disfavored voters. It’s an invitation that many are likely to accept.” Demos is continuing to litigate this case, however, because the notice the state sent to targeted voters failed to adequately inform them how to avoid being purged. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has endorsed our argument, writing that “Ohio has, for years, been removing voters from the rolls because they failed to respond to forms that are blatantly non-compliant with” federal law.  •	In a win for Indiana voters, a District Judge granted Demos’ motion for a preliminary injunction and blocked a new state law that would have allowed voters to be purged using the Kris Kobach program Crosscheck immediately beginning July 1, 2018. Crosscheck’s identification formula is flawed, and results in millions of people being falsely flagged as double registrants.     Fellows Program    The Demos Fellows Program develops and sustains fellows from diverse backgrounds, who produce books, research and commentary to shape a more vibrant and informed public conversation about policy. The Emerging Voices Initiative nurtures the careers of exciting young thought leaders, particularly those of color, to help address the profound lack of diversity among public commentators and to bring urgently needed new ideas into the debate.     PolicyShop Blog    PolicyShop is the official Demos blog, which ""strives to offer timely commentary and analysis on a range of national and state policy issues."" Frequent topics of commentary include jobs, middle class economic security, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,  Voter ID laws , campaign finance reform, and energy and sustainability.    Voter registration       The Democracy Program has worked to improve states' compliance with the  National Voter Registration Act   NVRA , focusing mainly on expanding voter registration opportunities at social service agencies for low income voters. Demos was part of a settlement in a lawsuit, filed in 2005, alleging Ohio Secretary of State  Ken Blackwell J. Kenneth Blackwell , Governor  Bob Taft , and their predecessors failed to protect the fundamental rights of eligible Ohio voters to cast a meaningful ballot, as required by the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the  Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution . This settlement is binding and requires the state to provide for uniformity and consistency in Ohio election procedures so that the opportunity to vote can be enjoyed equally by all Ohio citizens.     Leadership     Amelia Warren Tyagi , daughter of  Elizabeth Warren , is Board Chair and  Sabeel Rahman  is incoming president.

Mitchell . The founding and current president is Jason Grumet.   On June 17, 2009, BPC's Leaders Project on the State of American Health Care released a report, ''Crossing Our Lines  Working Together to Reform the U.S. Health System.'' The Task Force, led by former  Senate Budget Committee  Chairman  Pete Domenici  and former White House Budget Director and Federal Reserve Vice Chair  Alice Rivlin , was a bipartisan group of former White House and  Cabinet of the United States Cabinet  officials, Senate and House members, governors and mayors, and business and labor leaders.  On October 26, 2011, BPC launched the Housing Commission, a bipartisan effort led by  Kit Bond ,  Henry Cisneros ,  Mel Martinez , and  George J. Mitchell . The Commission released its final recommendations to reform the nation's housing policy in 2013,  In 2013, BPC launched the Commission on Political Reform to investigate the causes and consequences of America's partisan political divide. Senators Tom Daschle, Trent Lott, and Olympia Snowe along with Secretary Dan Glickman and Governor Dirk Kempthorne announced a set of   in June 2014. Over the course of 18 months, the commission, a group of thirty Americans from all political stripes, engaged concerned citizens across the country through town hall events and national surveys to develop the reforms.   In 2015, BPC announced the creation of the Congressional Patriot Awards, a biennial recognition given to two current or former members of the U.S. House of Representatives–one Democrat and one Republican–who have performed patriotic deeds worthy of remembrance.   In January 2018, BPC started the American Congressional Exchange program. In the program, Members of Congress agree to visit, for one weekend, a Member of the opposite party in that Member's district. That member, in turn, reciprocates the following year or when schedules permit.     Policy Areas      Economy    BPC's Economic Policy Project's work responds to the challenges facing the domestic economy by strengthening retirement security and personal savings, promoting sustainable federal fiscal policy, and educating the public about the potential consequences of failing to increase the nation’s debt limit.      Education    Over the last several years, BPC has focused on two areas on the Zero to Career continuum that are ripe for bipartisan engagement and movement  early childhood development, and how the higher education system can better-promote affordability and improve student outcomes.      Energy    As America has emerged as a major force in the global energy landscape through substantial improvements in energy efficiency, increased deployment of renewables, and falling fossil fuel costs, BPC has made significant efforts to help. BPC's Energy Project provides policy insights on what these changes mean for policymakers and the public, and explores how the nation can build upon our new energy abundance to address climate change.      Evidence-Based Policymaking    The Bipartisan Policy Center's Evidence-Based Policymaking Initiative supports the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking. Specifically, the initiative will provide advice and expertise on implementation options and strategies. It will also expand and extend the work of the Commission as Congress develops legislation and as the Executive Branch devises regulations, policies, and standards to improve the generation of high-level, quality evidence.      Governance    BPC's governance work lies within the Democracy Project, which keeps its finger on the pulse of American government. The Project examines trends and advances ideas for reform in areas from public service and election administration to the inner workings of Congress.      Immigration    BPC's Immigration Project and Immigration Task Force analyze and report on the state of U.S. Immigration policy, with an emphasis on the economic, humanitarian, and security aspects of the issue. Their findings allow them to make recommendations and develop the political case for bipartisan legislative immigration reform.      Infrastructure    Because government alone can't fully fund all of the nation's critical infrastructure needs, BPC has stepped in to help in recent years. BPC's Executive Council on Infrastructure is a working group of corporate CEOs and executives that advances recommendations to increase private sector investment in U.S. infrastructure projects.      National Security Project    The National Security Project brings together ideologically diverse experts to develop consensus on realistic recommendations for foreign policy and homeland security challenges. Major projects include the U.S.-Turkey partnership and broader regional issues including the ISIS conflict, Iran's nuclear program, countering violent extremism, defense issues, and cybersecurity.

Started in order to support the campaign of  Sir T. Muthuswamy Iyer  for a judgeship at the  Madras High Court  and to counter the propaganda against him carried out by the  Anglo-Indian  press, ''The Hindu'' was one of the many newspapers of the period established to protest the policies of the  British Raj . About 100 copies of the inaugural issue were printed at Srinidhi Press,  Georgetown, Chennai Georgetown  on one rupee and twelves annas of borrowed money. Subramania Iyer became the first editor and Veera Raghavacharya, the first  managing director  of the newspaper.  The paper was initially printed from Srinidhi Press but later moved to Scottish Press, then to The Hindu Press,  Mylapore . Started as a weekly newspaper, the paper became a tri-weekly in 1883 and an evening daily in 1889. A single copy of the newspaper was priced at four  Indian anna anna s. The offices moved to rented premises at 100  Mount Road  on 3 December 1883. The newspaper started printing at its own press there, named ""The National Press,"" which was established on borrowed capital as public subscriptions were not forthcoming. The building itself became ''The Hindu''s in 1892, after the Maharaja of  Vizianagaram ,  Pusapati Ananda Gajapati Raju , gave The National Press a loan both for the building and to carry out needed expansion.  ''The Hindu'' was initially liberal in its outlook and is now considered left leaning. Its editorial stances have earned it the nickname, the ' Maha Vishnu  of Mount Road'. a politically ambitious lawyer who had migrated from a  Kumbakonam  village to practise in  Coimbatore  and from thence to  Madras .    Modern history   In the late 1985s, when its ownership passed into the hands of the family's younger members, a change<!--cit that prior to 1980 the hindu was not left leaning--> in political leaning was observed. Worldpress.org lists ''The Hindu'' as a left-leaning independent newspaper. The Bofors scandal broke in April 1987 with Swedish Radio alleging that bribes had been paid to top Indian political leaders, officials and Army officers in return for the Swedish arms manufacturing company winning a hefty contract with the Government of India for the purchase of 155&nbsp;mm howitzers. During a six-month period, the newspaper published scores of copies of original papers that documented the secret payments, amounting to $50 million, into Swiss bank accounts, the agreements behind the payments, communications relating to the payments and the crisis response, and other material. The investigation was led by a part-time correspondent of ''The Hindu'',  Chitra Subramaniam , reporting from  Geneva , and was supported by Ram in Chennai. The scandal was a major embarrassment to the party in power at the centre, the  Indian National Congress , and its leader Prime Minister  Rajiv Gandhi . The paper's editorial accused the Prime Minister of being party to massive fraud and cover-up.  In 2003, the  Jayalalitha  government of the state of Tamil Nadu, of which Chennai is the capital, filed cases against ''The Hindu'' for breach of privilege of the state legislative body. The move was perceived as a government's assault on freedom of the press. The paper garnered support from the journalistic community. On 16 September 2013, The Hindu group launched its  Tamil language Tamil  edition with K. Ashokan as editor.  On 5 January 2016,  Malini Parthasarathy , the Editor of the newspaper, resigned with immediate effect. It was reported by the media that she resigned her post, citing ""general dissatisfaction"" with her performance.

The service was designed for viewers for whom ""watching news is not an option"" by providing a direct simulcast to the TV channel, with ""No Comment"" segment being replaced by music. The music of the bulletin openings are also transmitted on Euronews Radio. Weather reports are read by a female announcer.     Africanews      On 20 April 2016, the French subsidiary of Euronews launched an African version of their news service called Africanews in French and English.     Partnership with NBC    In November 2016, the channel's executive board was in talks with  NBCUniversal , parent company of  NBC News , for a ""strategic partnership"". NBCU would acquire 15 to 30% ownership of the Euronews network, would contribute to Euronews content, and facilitate NBC News' expanded operations in Europe. After the formation of the partnership, video reports from NBC News' properties began to appear frequently on the TV channel and reports from  NBCNews.com  began to be distributed on its digital platforms.   On 9 May 2017, Euronews split its service into 12 language-specific editions, of which nine have a linear TV channel with its own language voiceover, but now including contents, on-air graphics  except for some segments  and its lower-third news ticker in the language. The ''glocal'' strategy allows the language editorial teams to personalise the content and presentation of their channel, not only by sharing own-produced content with other languages, but by producing content that is relevant to local audiences, and allowing local reporters and presenters to appear on camera in all its language editions. The splitting process finished on 24 May 2017.  Additionally, the Arabic and Persian language editions became available only on Euronews' website and apps, with the TV channels being discontinued, and the Ukrainian edition was discontinued outright, due to lack of funding from the Ukrainian government.  Alongside conventional rolling news shows, debate programming, talk shows and new presenter-led shows will be offered during the weekly schedule, and throughout programmes, Euronews reporters from different nationalities will be offering context on stories close to their respective home nationalities.  The traditional pre-produced blocks of video content still remains on late nights and weekends. Most overnights now repeat the previous day's edition  either full or half length  of ''Euronews Now''.  New weekly programming is also being produced, including the weekly interview series ''Uncut'', which feature conversations from political leaders and newsmakers worldwide with minimum to no editing. The first episodes feature German-French politician  Daniel Cohn-Bendit  interviewing former  UKIP  leader  Nigel Farage  and former  Prime Minister of the United Kingdom UK Prime Minister   Tony Blair  about  Brexit . Additionally, a new social media unit was created, with journalists with a background on digital news verification leading it. The newly-created team help to produce ''The Cube'', a social media segment during rolling news shows, focusing on analysis on treatment and reactions about news headlines on social media, with special attention at the major stories of the day. ''No Comment'', a long-standing element of Euronews' programming, remains on the channels' schedule, and it's being gradually integrated into the rolling news shows on the English-language channel. .

Also, as of May 4, 2015, ''LNP'', a seven-day newspaper based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, is printed in the same facility as ''The Patriot-News''.     History    ''The Patriot-News'' officially traces its history to March 4, 1854, with the founding of ''The Daily Patriot''.  Its heritage dates, however, to December 1820, involving a weekly newspaper named ''The Pennsylvania Intelligencer''.  In 1855, ''The Patriot'' bought the ''Democratic Union'', successor of the ''Intelligencer,'' and merged them into ''The Patriot & Union.''  It was a weekly paper, but published three days a week when the legislature was in session.  It became a daily publication again in 1868 as ''The Morning Patriot'', changing its name to the ''Harrisburg Daily Patriot'' in 1875 and dropping Harrisburg from its masthead in 1890.  The other half of the paper began in 1917 as ''The Evening News.''  In 1947, both papers were bought by Edwin Russell, with financial backing from the Newhouse chain, forerunner of Advance Publications.  Later that year, the Newhouse chain assumed majority ownership, though Russell remained as the papers' driving force until his death in 2001.  The retraction received considerable national coverage;  NPR  and  Fox News Channel  interviewed several of the paper's editors.  Deputy opinion page editor Matthew Zencey said the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address was the perfect time to ask, ""Gee, can you believe what rock heads ran this outfit 150 years ago?""  In 2003, the paper won the Pennsylvania Newspaper Association]s G. Richard Dew Award for Journalistic Service for its coverage of the attempted sale of  Hershey Foods . In 2004, the newspaper was named as one of ""10 That Do It Right"" by  Editor & Publisher  magazine. The newspaper has won the  Pennsylvania Newspaper Association 's Keystone Press Award Division I Sweepstakes, which goes to the large metro newspaper that wins the most journalism awards, in 2004, 2006, and 2010, competing against the newspapers in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Allentown as the smallest paper in that division.  The year 2004 also began a run in the Pennsylvania Newspaper Association's Newspaper of the Year Awards unmatched in the contest's history. ''The Patriot-News'' has been either first or second place as the state's Newspaper of the Year for seven years in a row, with first-place wins in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2010. The contest includes more than 50 newspapers from across the state, including Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.  The newspaper's reporters have won the Pennsylvania Newspaper Association's Distinguished Writing Award multiple times, most recently to reporter John Luciew in 2013.  Crime reporter and  Penn State  grad Sara Ganim began gaining national attention in the wake of the Penn State sex abuse scandal after coach  Jerry Sandusky 's indictment in November 2011. Ganim had written a substantial piece in March 2011, when few others were covering the story. Among other follow-ups, she then spoke to two of the mothers of alleged victims for the paper in the immediate wake of the indictment. “You can credit the ''Patriot-News'' with giving me the time a reporter needs to cover this kind of story,"" she said to a New York media columnist who specially noted her coverage.    Audience   In 2012, the paper drew 476,000 readers weekly in print and on PennLive. As of November 2018, the newsstand price was $1.50 daily and $3 for the Sunday edition.

The paper is the second largest in the state  first is the  '' Charlotte Observer '' . The paper has  been awarded three  Pulitzer Prize s; the most recent of which was in 1996 for a series on the health and environmental impact of North Carolina's booming hog industry. The paper was one of the first in the world to launch an online version of the publication,  Nando Nando.net  in 1994.    History   The ''News & Observer'' traces its roots to ''The Sentinel,'' which was founded by the Rev. William E. Pell in 1865 'to help expose corruption in state politics""  to maintain  white supremacy   during the  Reconstruction Era .  paper's struggles to stay relevant and make money led to new ownership in 1868. With the new owner ''The Sentinel'' began to cover the  Democratic Party  United States  Democrats ' push to retake the  North Carolina General Assembly North Carolina Legislature , along with the impeachment of  William Woods Holden Gov. William W. Holden  in 1871.  File Josephus Daniels 1.jpg thumb left 150px Josephus Daniels, the principal shaper of ''The News & Observer''  ''The Sentinel'' went bankrupt a little over ten years after the paper was first founded. The owners of the newly founded ''Raleigh Observer'', Peter M. Hale and  William L. Saunders , bought the now-bankrupt paper, ending its publication and focusing on the ''Raleigh Observer''. After about ten years the paper ran out of money, so the two owners sold to the owner of the ''Raleigh News'', Samuel A. Ashe.  Ashe combined the two papers under the new banner ''The News & Observer'' in September 1880, making it the sole daily paper in  Raleigh, North Carolina Raleigh . Ashe ran the company personally until 1894, focusing on politics and the  Democratic Party  United States  Democratic  party. Ashe used connections within the Democratic Party to get an upper leg on upcoming stories. This model worked well for the paper until Ashe lost favor in the Democratic  caucus , leading the paper to fall on hard financial times for the fourth time in its history.     The voice of white supremacy    In 1894 the paper was sold at auction, this time to a  Washington, North Carolina  native who was a strong Democratic supporter.  Josephus Daniels , with help from  Julian Carr  industrialist  Julian S. Carr  and other friends, bought the paper. Quickly Daniels refocused the ''News and Observer'' to combat rampant corruption and other problems he saw within the state. Put differently by Daniels himself, ""The ''News and Observer'' was relied upon to carry the Democratic message and to be the militant voice of  White Supremacy , and it did not fail in what was expected, sometimes going to extremes in its partisanship."" Daniels believed that ""the greatest folly and crime"" in U.S. history was giving negros the vote. According to historian Helen Edmonds, the paper ""led in a campaign of prejudice, bitterness, vilification, misrepresentation, and exaggeration to influence the emotions of the whites against the Negro.""  Daniels also used the ''News and Observer'' to persuade  North Carolina  citizens to support the  Disfranchisement disenfranchisement  of blacks in the 1910s and 1920s. Daniels later  renounce d the racist policies of the 1910s ''News and Observer''.     After Daniels    Daniels continued to run the paper until his death in the mid-1940s. After his death his four sons assumed management of the company. All four sons contributed to the operation of the paper, but  Jonathan W. Daniels Jonathan Daniels , editor from 1933 to 1941 and from 1948 until 1964, kept the paper in the direction of appealing for school desegregation and a reduction in race related discrimination. It was also under Jonathan's leadership that ''The News and Observer'' bought out the '' Raleigh Times '' and moved to a building on South McDowell St. in  downtown Raleigh , where they stayed until the building was sold in 2015.  On September 3, 1934, ''The News and Observer'' began a column about state politics called ""Under the Dome"", which started on the back page, moved to the front and now runs in the local section. Layoffs and buyouts have continued since then.    In 2015 the newspaper announced it would sell its facility in downtown Raleigh for redevelopment, which will entail demolition of much of the facility. New presses will be installed at the newspaper's auxiliary production facility in  Garner, North Carolina Garner . Editorial offices will remain in a portion of the redeveloped facility.  ; 1989 – Pulitzer Prize in Criticism    Michael Skube  was awarded for his writing about books and other literary topics.    Ownership    On May 17, 1995 the News & Observer Publishing Company was sold to  The McClatchy Company McClatchy Newspapers  of  Sacramento, California Sacramento ,  California  for $373 Million ending 101 years of Daniels family ownership. In the mid-1990s  Flexography Flexo  Machines were installed allowing the paper to print thirty-two pages in color which was the largest capacity of any newspaper within the United States at the time.

History        1998–2001  Early years     News24 was launched in October 1998 as part of Naspers’ new internet strategy. Naspers’ new managing director at the time, Koos Bekker, wanted to expand the company's online portfolio by offering News24 users breaking news around the clock.  Rossouw was appointed News24's first publisher. News24 focused on offering its users breaking local news, while relying on wire copy to keep them informed of international news. Within its first year, News24 became the biggest news website in South Africa.  Initially based in Johannesburg, News24 relocated to Cape Town in 2001 to form part of the newly created Media24 Digital division under the leadership of Russell Hanly. The move was brought on by the restructuring of Media24's digital operations. Soon the need to restructure arose, and News24's employees were cut from 30 to 18, with Douw Steyn as business manager and Cobus Heyl as editor. During this time, Independent Newspaper's IOL overtook News24 as South Africa's number one news website.  However, according to Heyl, ""this deficit was made up in the first two months of operation in Cape Town through renewed focus on breaking news. While we publish in text and pictures, News24 should have more uninterrupted broadcast news than daily newspaper news."" Most of News24's content  70%  came from the wires or translated newspaper articles  20% , yet steps were taken to produce more original content.      2001  Reality TV and terror attacks     Two events in 2001 significantly increased News24's popularity amongst internet users. The first Big Brother South Africa reality television show and the  September 11 terrorist attacks  on the  World Trade Center  1973–2001  World Trade Center  in New York City boosted News24's momentum beyond expectation.  Even though Big Brother South Africa wasn't a traditional news event, the site couldn't ignore the show's popularity – especially to those who had access to the internet, as they were captivated by the housemates’ shenanigans. News24 brought users live updates and screengrabs as events happened. This worked well with the trend of high internet usage during the day and TV usage at night.  Heyl described 11 September 2001 as ""one of the most exciting afternoons at News24. This was undoubtedly the day News24 stopped crawling and started walking."" After the first plane hit the World Trade Center, News24's editorial team immediately switched from the Big Brother live application, to focus on images of the unfolding event in the US, commenting on the news as it came in. Other groups in the 24.com network also contributed content by writing background pieces, creating slideshows, graphics and maps. ""Within seconds to minutes all the news on the homepage was replaced with news reports and some of the most dramatic news pictures ever seen,"" said Heyl. The marketing team organised live reads on radio, which made News24 the local breaking news site on the event in South Africa. ""As far as usage was concerned, News24 never looked back again,"" said Heyl.       2002  Restructuring     Despite the fact that News24's traffic continued to climb, it was still struggling to turn a profit and in September 2002 the operation was restructured again. The editorial team was cut back to 12. Heyl took over as business manager, while Bryan Porter became editor. News24 became central to all of Media24 Digital's sites and re-launched in December 2002. For the first time News24's potential to traffic users to other Media 24 Digital sites in the 24.com network was used. The new template included strong homepage focus areas showcasing content from other 24.com sites like Health24, Food24 and Women24.      2003 to 2006  profit, TV and mobile     In 2003, Media24 Digital's advertising team began to earn commission. News24 was the company's best performing digital unit in terms of usage and revenue with remarkable Y-on-Y revenue growth in 2003 and 2004.  During this period News24 branced out into TV and cellphones.  The South African Internet market had few ""at home"" users. Dial-up internet was slow and expensive, which resulted in most people accessing the internet from work. News24's online usage would peak during office hours and significantly drop at night and over the weekends. It was decided that News24 would launch on DStv's interactive platform to strengthen its brand usage during off-peak hours.  At the same time, News24 was working on its first WAP site to make content available on cellphones. According to Porter, ""This heralded a new brand position for News24 – ‘Anywhere, Anytime’, meaning our users could access the news wherever they were, whenever they liked, on the device of their choice.""  To differentiate themselves from their competitors in a market that relied heavily on wire service content, News24 began to recruit regular columnists to cover a wide range of issues. The columnist section was launched in mid 2004, focusing on news analysis, as well as financial and sport commentary.  Usage-wise, News24 became the first online site to register one million unique local users in a single month and during the course of 2004 witnessed some profitable months. In November 2004, Heyl was replaced as business manager by the Sunday Times's Elan Lohmann. Porter remained as editor and Jannie Momberg and Elmarie Jack as news editors. Lohmann sought to monetise News24 by restructuring the advertising model, extending the product offering and focussing on a more service-orientated approach to advertisers.4 Momberg became the editor of News24 in 2006.       2007  MyNews24     News24 introduced a user-generated content section in 2007 to reflect the web 2.0 and the growth of social media. This section in effect replaced the letters section of the site and allowed users to have their articles, and later photos and blogs published.      2009  Facelift     In May 2009 News24 underwent a facelift to update its look.  New features on the site included  Inside News24, which offered users links to more in-depth  content from other 24.com channels. Two new sections, Opinion and Multimedia, were created as well.  MyNews24 experienced major changes as users could now rate content and authors, user-generated photographs featured more and the leaderboard allowed users to track the performance of their articles. By 2009 user-generated content had grown by 79%.  News24 ended the year on a high note with a record-breaking 1.5 million unique local users visiting the site in the month of November.      2010  Over two million users     In April 2010, News24 became the first South African website and online news provider to reach more than two million domestic unique browsers  UBs  in a month. Including international readership, the site reached over 2.8 million unique users in April.  ""Given that no other news site to date has surpassed the one million UB mark, the two million South Africans per month milestone is a major achievement and proves we are on the cutting-edge of local internet engagement,"" said Momberg.  News24’s mobile application also experienced significant growth. Traffic to the site’s WAP application increased by more than 124% from February to April in 2010.      2011  Exploring new markets     In April 2011, News24 launched a Zulu language news site to meet the public’s demand for news in their home language. As expected, the site quickly flourished on the mobile platform, offering a new channel of accessing news for users who do not access the web through a computer.  News24 Kenya was launched in October 2011, followed by News24 Nigeria in June 2012 in a bid to create a presence in other African territories. As expected, the growth of the sites has been most obvious on mobile.     Content        News     The main news sections on the site are South Africa, World, Africa, Travel, Technology, Green and Opinion. News24 also publishes Special Reports  SA Politics, Zimbabwe, AIDS Focus and more  that offer readers in-depth coverage of the most important news events.  Regular columnists feature on the site and deliver comments on events in the news. Reportage on business news is done through Fin24.com and on sport through Sport24.co.za.   Entertainment news is reported on Channel24.co.za.      MyNews24     Inspired by the South Korean citizen journalism website, OhmyNews, News24 launched MyNews24 in 2007. This section allows users to publish their own articles and photographs. Cathryn Reece, who was in charge of running MyNews24, said that it took some time for it to take off, but that the number of unique users have grown from 5,000 in 2007 to 183,000 in 2010 and 480,500 in May 2014.  While users can write about whatever they want, Reece said that most of the submissions they receive are “news-related opinion based articles”. The amount of user-generated content is also dependent on news events.  Photographs sent in by users are “a big component” of MyNews24. Reece said that it seems that more people are willing to send in photographs if they witness something newsworthy than actually write an article about it. Also, through advertising the fact that users can publish photographs on MyNews24, many have become used to the idea of sending in images. According to Momberg, MyNews24 allows users to “engage with the news of the day, giving it more depth and public perspective”.       Lifestyle     News24 links to softer health, lifestyle, and entertainment stories across the 24.com network through their Special Focus or Inside News24 sections, both of which appear on the homepage.  Other 24.com sites include  •	Health24 •	Women24 •	Traveller24 •	Wheels24 •	Food24 •	GoTravel24 •	Channel24 •	Parent24 •	Ancestry24 •	Careers24 •	Property24 •	isiZulu News24 •	Wheels24 •	Fin24 •	News24 Nigeria •	News24 Kenya      Multimedia     Multimedia has been part of News24 since 2009. The site’s multimedia coverage is offered across the site’s news sections with specific significance to locally produced South African content.  Having grown to an average of 150,000 unique browsers per month, it is the biggest multimedia component of a news website in South Africa.     Mobile    In 2003 News24 started to develop its WAP site to make content available on cellphones. Mobile was identified as a key growth sector for News24.  In South Africa, and other African countries, internet penetration is still low as many people only have web access at work, while others don’t have any access at all. However, South Africa’s cellular penetration stood at 98% in 2009. This, coupled with the increased availability of cheaper smartphones, would suggest that more and more people are accessing the internet from their phones.  By visiting m.news24.com, users can download the mobile version of News24, which is designed for smaller cellphone screens.      Applications     News24's iPhone application was the first application of its kind among digital news sources in South Africa. The application is available for Apple, Windows, BlackBerry, Android users, as well as Java-enabled phones, and includes top stories, multimedia, the latest sport and entertainment news – and so much more. The application can also be used to submit  news tips or photographs.  The News24 app is the most downloaded news application in Africa .  In August 2010, News24 launched its iPad application, the first of its kind in South Africa. The application takes advantage of the iPads bigger screen and is a hybrid of the current iPhone application and the website.     Interactive TV    News24’s interactive channel on DStv was launched in October 2003. This service allows DStv subscribers to view News24’s top stories via their TV sets. Other sections include general news, sport and finance, with particular focus on South Africa and Africa.  The decision to launch this channel was inspired by the trend in South Africa whereby internet usage drops significantly after office hours and TV usage rises at night. When stories are updated on the website, they are automatically fed to DStv, which is updated at various intervals, day and night, seven days a week.     References      News24 turns ten.

Patton  for the song "" John Brown's Body "". These rivaled  The Battle Hymn of the Republic the lyrics  published two months later by  Julia Ward Howe . Medill served as mayor of Chicago for one term after the  Great Chicago Fire  of 1871.     Years of McCormick    Under the 20th-century editorship of Colonel  Robert R. McCormick , who took control in the 1920s, the paper was strongly  United States non-interventionism isolationist  and aligned with the  Old Right  United States  Old Right  in its coverage of political news and social trends. It used the motto ""The American Paper for Americans"". Through the 1930s to the 1950s, it excoriated the  Democratic Party  United States  Democrats  and the  New Deal  of  Franklin D. Roosevelt , was resolutely disdainful of the British and French, and greatly enthusiastic for  Chiang Kai-shek  and Sen.  Joseph McCarthy .  When McCormick assumed the position of co-editor  with his cousin  Joseph Medill Patterson   in 1910, the ''Tribune'' was the third-best-selling paper among Chicago's eight dailies, with a circulation of only 188,000. But, the aircraft was destroyed by ice on July 15, 1929, near  Ungava Bay  at the tip of  Labrador , Canada. The crew were rescued by the Canadian science ship  CSS Acadia CSS ''Acadia'' .  During the McCormick years, the ''Tribune'' was a champion of  modified spelling  for simplicity  such as spelling ""although"" as ""altho"" . The story revealing that Americans broke the enemy naval codes was not cleared by censors, and had US President  Franklin D. Roosevelt  so enraged that he considered shutting down the ''Tribune''.  After leaving, Soll married  Pam Zekman , a Chicago newspaper  and future TV  reporter. He worked for the short-lived ''Chicago Times'' magazine in the late 1980s.  In January 1977, ''Tribune'' columnist Will Leonard died at age 64.  In May 1983, ''Tribune'' columnist Aaron Gold died at age 45 of complications from  leukemia .  In 1986, the ''Tribune'' announced that celebrated film critic  Gene Siskel , the ''Tribune''s best-known writer, was no longer the paper's film critic, and that his position with the paper had shifted from being that of a full-time film critic to that of a freelance contract writer who was to write about the film industry for the Sunday paper and also provide capsule film reviews for the paper's entertainment sections. The demotion occurred after Siskel and longtime Chicago film critic colleague  Roger Ebert  decided to shift the production of their weekly movie-review show—then known as '' At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert '' and later known as '' Siskel & Ebert & The Movies ''—from  Tribune Entertainment  to  The Walt Disney Company 's  Disney–ABC Domestic Television Buena Vista Television  unit. ""He has done a great job for us,"" editor James Squires said at the time. ""It's a question of how much a person can do physically. We think you need to be a newspaper person first, and Gene Siskel has always tried to do that. But there comes a point when a career is so big that you can't do that."" Siskel declined to comment on the new arrangement, but Ebert publicly criticized Siskel's ''Tribune'' bosses for punishing Siskel for taking their television program to a company other than Tribune Entertainment.  In November 1992, ''Tribune'' associate subject editor Searle ""Ed"" Hawley was arrested by Chicago police and charged with seven counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse for allegedly having sex with three juveniles in his home in  Evanston, Illinois .  In December 1993, the ''Tribune''s longtime Washington, D.C. bureau chief,  Nicholas Horrock , was removed from his post after he chose not to attend a meeting that editor  Howard Tyner  requested of him in Chicago. In mid-1995, Holt was replaced as sports editor by Tim Franklin and shifted to a newly created job, customer service editor. You later worked for the '' National Enquirer '' and as a producer for '' The Jerry Springer Show '' before committing suicide in November 2005. Eight months later, Perkins stepped down as TV critic, and he left the paper shortly thereafter.  In 1997, the ''Tribune'' celebrated its 150th anniversary in part by tapping longtime reporter  Stevenson Swanson  to edit the book ''Chicago Days  150 Defining Moments in the Life of a Great City''.  On April 29, 1997, popular columnist  Mike Royko  died of a  brain aneurysm . On September 2, 1997, the ''Tribune'' promoted longtime City Hall reporter  John Kass  to take Royko's place as the paper's principal Page Two news columnist.  On June 6, 1999, the ''Tribune'' published a first-person travel article from freelance writer Gaby Plattner that described a supposed incident in which a pilot for  Air Zimbabwe  who was flying without a copilot inadvertently locked himself out of his cockpit while the plane was flying on  autopilot  and as a result needed to use a large ax to chop a hole in the cockpit door. In early August 2008, managing editor for news  Hanke Gratteau  resigned, and several weeks later, managing editor for features  James Warren  journalist  James Warren  resigned as well.  Tribune's Baltimore Community papers include ''Arbutus Times'', ''Baltimore Messenger'', ''Catonsville Times'', ''Columbia Flier'', ''Howard County Times'', ''The Jeffersonian'', ''Laurel Leader'', ''Lifetimes'', ''North County News'', ''Northeast Booster'', ''Northeast Reporter'', ''Owings Mills Times'', and ''Towson Times''.  The ''Howard County Times'' was named 2010 Newspaper of the Year by the Suburban Newspaper Association. In 2003, editorial writer  Cornelia Grumman  snagged the award for editorial writing. He ultimately returned to the '' Boston Globe '', where he had been working immediately before the ''Tribune'' had hired him.  In May 2004, the ''Tribune'' revealed that freelance reporter  Mark Falanga  was unable to verify some facts that he inserted in a lifestyle-related column that ran on April 18, 2004, about an expensive lunch at a Chicago restaurant—namely, that the restaurant charged $15 for a bottle of water and $35 for a pasta entree. ""Upon questioning, the freelance writer indicated the column was based on an amalgam of three restaurants and could not verify the prices,"" the paper noted. The paper ordered every spare body to go to the ''Tribune''s printing plant to pull already-printed WomanNews sections containing the story from the Wednesday, October 27, 2004, package of preprinted sections in the ''Tribune''. Discussions ultimately ended, however, after the ''Sun-Times'' threatened to sue for violating Mariotti's noncompete agreement, which was to run until August 2009.  In the first decade of the 21st century, the ''Tribune'' had multiple rounds of reductions of staff through layoffs and buyouts as it has coped with the industrywide declines in advertising revenues    In December 2005, the ''Tribune'' eliminated 28 editorial positions through a combination of buyouts and layoffs, including what were believed to be the first layoffs in the paper's history.   In March 2008, the paper gave buyouts to about 25 newsroom employees, including sportswriter  Sam Smith  sportswriter  Sam Smith .   Also in August 2008, about 36 editorial employees took voluntary buyouts or resigned, including well-known bylines like Michael Tackett, Ron Silverman, Timothy McNulty, Ed Sherman, Evan Osnos, Steve Franklin, Maurice Possley, Hanke Gratteau, Chuck Osgood and Skip Myslenski.   On December 4, 2008, about 11 newsroom employees were laid-off, with one sports columnist,  Mike Downey , having departed several weeks earlier when his contract was not renewed. Well-known bylines who were laid off included Neil Milbert, Stevenson Swanson, Lisa Anderson, Phil Marty, Charles Storch, Courtney Flynn and Deborah Horan. That number was less than the 90 newsroom jobs that Crain's Chicago Business previously had reported were to be eliminated. Among those let go were DuPage County reporter  Art Barnum , Editorial Board member  Pat Widder  and photographer  Dave Pierini .  In September 2012, ''Tribune'' education reporter Joel Hood resigned from the paper to become a real estate broker, City Hall reporter Kristen Mack left the paper to become press secretary for Cook County Board President  Toni Preckwinkle ,  Also in October 2012, the ''Tribune'' announced plans to create a pay wall for its website, offering digital-only subscriptions at $14.99 per month, starting on November 1, 2012. Seven-day print subscribers would continue to have unlimited online access at no additional charge. The suit had been filed in federal court on behalf of Carolyn Rusin, who had been a TribLocal staff reporter from July 2010 until October 2011. On the graphic on June 12, the word ""Bruins"" was ripped off and the comment was added, ""Yeah, not right now we're not"", in a reference to the  2013 Stanley Cup Finals , which play the  Chicago Blackhawks  against the  Boston Bruins .  On April 6, 2014, the ''Tribune'' increased the newsstand price of its Sunday/Thanksgiving Day paper by 50 percent to $2.99 for a single copy. The newsrack price increased $0.75, or 42.9%, to $2.50.  On February 18, 2016, the Tribune announced the retirement of editor Gerould Kern and the immediate promotion of the paper's editorial page editor, R. Bruce Dold, to be the Tribune's editor. The ''Tribune'' endorsed Obama once again for reelection in 2012. and in 1912 the paper endorsed  Theodore Roosevelt , who ran on the  Progressive Party  United States, 1912  Progressive Party  slate against Republican President  William Howard Taft . In 2016, the Tribune endorsed the  Libertarian Party  United States  Libertarian Party  candidate, former New Mexico Governor  Gary Johnson  for president, over Republican  Donald Trump  and Democrat  Hillary Clinton . despite the newspapers having had two years to prepare for it. on the ''Tribune''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s web site  was controversial and is largely regarded as an effort in cost-cutting. A year after going private, following a $124&nbsp;million third-quarter loss, the Tribune Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 8, 2008. The company made its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, citing a debt of $13&nbsp;billion and assets of $7.6&nbsp;billion.  As part of its bankruptcy plan, owner Sam Zell intended to sell the Cubs to reduce debt. This sale has become linked to the corruption charges leading to the December 9, 2008, arrest of former Illinois Governor  Rod Blagojevich . Specifically, the ex-governor was accused of exploiting the paper's financial trouble in an effort to have several editors fired.  The law firm Brown Rudnick, representing the Aurelius group of junior creditors, filed fraudulent transfer claims and fraud claims against 33,000 to 35,000 stockholders who bought Tribune stock.

Founded in 1914 by leaders of the  Progressivism in the United States progressive movement , it attempted to find a balance between a humanitarian progressivism and an intellectual scientism, and ultimately discarded the latter.    Political views   Domestically, ''The New Republic'' as of 2011 supported a largely  modern liberalism in the United States modern liberal  stance on fiscal and social issues, Prior to 2014, while defending federal programs like Medicare and the EPA, it advocated some policies that, while seeking to achieve the ends of traditional social welfare programs, often used market solutions as their means, and so were often called ""business-friendly"". Typical of some of the policies supported by both ''The New Republic'' and the DLC during the 1990s were increased funding for the  Earned Income Tax Credit  program and reform of the Federal welfare system, and  supply-side economics , especially the idea of reducing higher  marginal income tax rate s, which received heavy criticism from senior editor  Jonathan Chait .</blockquote>  ''The New Republic'' does not focus solely on domestic policy, as it also brings analysis and commentary of various international affairs. Support for  Israel  was a strong theme in ''The New Republic'' under  Martin Peretz , the former owner of ''The New Republic''  ""Support for Israel is deep down an expression of America's best view of itself.""</blockquote>  On June 23, 2006, in response to criticism of the magazine from the blog  Daily Kos ,  Marty Peretz Martin Peretz  wrote the following as a summary of ''The New Republic''s stances on then-recent issues  Such editorials and articles exemplify the liberal political orientation of ''The New Republic''.    History       Early years    ''The New Republic'' was founded by  Herbert Croly ,  Walter Lippmann , and  Walter Weyl  through the financial backing of heiress  Dorothy Payne Whitney  and her husband,  Willard Straight , who maintained majority ownership. The magazine's first issue was published on November 7, 1914. The magazine's politics were  liberalism in the United States liberal  and  Progressive Movement progressive , and as such concerned with coping with the great changes brought about by middle-class reform efforts designed to remedy the weaknesses in America's changing economy and society. The magazine is widely considered important in changing the character of liberalism in the direction of governmental interventionism, both foreign and domestic. Amongst the most important of these was the emergence of the U.S. as a  great power  on the international scene. In 1917, ''TNR'' urged America's entry into  World War I the Great War  on the side of the  Allies of World War I Allies .  One consequence of World War I was the  Russian Revolution of 1917 . During the inter-war years, the magazine was generally positive in its assessment of the  Soviet Union  and  Joseph Stalin . However, the magazine changed its position after the  Cold War  began in 1947, and in 1948 its leftist editor,  Henry A. Wallace , departed to run for president on the  Progressive Party  United States, 1948  Progressive  ticket. After Wallace, ''TNR'' moved toward positions more typical of mainstream American liberalism. Throughout the 1950s, the publication was critical of both Soviet foreign policy and domestic  anti-communism , particularly  McCarthyism . During the 1960s, the magazine opposed the  Vietnam War , but was also often critical of the  New Left .  Up until the late 1960s, the magazine had a certain ""cachet as the voice of re-invigorated liberalism"", in the opinion of commentator Eric Alterman. He has criticized the magazine's politics from the left. That cachet, Alterman wrote, ""was perhaps best illustrated when the dashing, young President Kennedy had been photographed boarding Air Force One holding a copy"". from Gilbert Harrison.  A final ingredient that led to the magazine's increased stature in the 1980s was its ""back of the book"" or literary, cultural and arts pages, which were edited by  Leon Wieseltier . Peretz discovered Wieseltier, then working at Harvard's Society of Fellows, and put him in charge of the section. Wieseltier reinvented the section along the lines of '' The New York Review of Books '', allowing his critics, many of them academics, to write longer, critical essays instead of simple book reviews. Alterman calls the selection of Wieseltier ""probably [...] Peretz's single most significant positive achievement"" in running the magazine. During other changes of editors, Wieseltier remained as cultural editor. Under him the section was ""simultaneously erudite and zestful,"" according to Alterman, who added, ""Amazingly, a full generation later, it still sings."" The magazine also published a very critical article by  Elizabeth McCaughey  about the  Presidency of Bill Clinton Clinton Administration 's  Clinton health care plan of 1993 health care plan , commonly known as ""Hillarycare"" due to its close association with First Lady  Hillary Clinton . Alterman described this article as ""dishonest, misinformed"", and ""the single most influential article published in the magazine during the entire Clinton presidency"",   Charles Lane  journalist  Chuck Lane  held the editor's position between 1997 and 1999. During Lane's tenure, the  Stephen Glass  reporter  Stephen Glass   #Stephen Glass scandal scandal  occurred. Peretz has written that Lane ultimately ""put the ship back on its course,"" for which Peretz said he was ""immensely grateful."" But Peretz later fired Lane, who learned of his ouster when a '' Washington Post '' reporter called him for a comment. In the  Entourage  Pilot  pilot episode  of the  HBO  series '' Entourage  U.S. TV series  Entourage ,'' which first aired on July 18, 2004,  Ari Gold  Entourage  Ari Gold  asks  Eric Murphy   ""Do you read ''The New Republic''? Well, I do, and it says that you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.""     Peretz sells remaining shares, then buys magazine back from CanWest    Until February 2007, ''The New Republic'' was owned by Martin Peretz, New York financiers  Roger Hertog  and  Michael Steinhardt , and Canadian media conglomerate  Canwest .  In late February 2007, Peretz sold his share of the magazine to CanWest, which announced that a subsidiary,  CanWest Media Works International , had acquired a full interest in the publication. Peretz retained his position as editor-in-chief.  In March 2009, Peretz and a group of investors, led by former Lazard executive Laurence Grafstein and that also included  Michael Atler ,     New format    Starting with the March 19, 2007 issue, the magazine implemented major changes    ''Decreased frequency''  the magazine went to publishing twice a month, or 24 times a year. This replaced the old plan of publishing 44 issues a year. The magazine described its publication schedule as ""biweekly,"" with specified ""skipped publication dates."" There were ten of these in 2010.   ''New design and layout''  Issues featured more visuals, new art and other ""reader friendly"" content. Warnock typeface throughout were accented by woodcut-style illustrations.   ''More pages and bigger size''  Issues are bigger and contain more pages.   ''Improved paper''  Covers and pages became sturdier.   ''Increased newsstand price''  Although the subscription prices did not change, the newsstand price increased from $3.95 to $4.95.   ''Website redesign''  The website offered more daily content and new features. Under Hughes, the magazine became less focused on "" Inside the Beltway The Beltway "", with more cultural coverage and attention to visuals. It stopped running an editorial in every issue. Media observers noted a less uniformly pro-Israel tone in the magazine's coverage  in contrast to its editorial stance during Marty Peretz's ownership . These changes provoked a major crisis among the publication's editorial staff and contributing editors. The magazine’s literary editor,  Leon Wieseltier , resigned in protest. Subsequent days brought many more resignations, including those of executive editors Rachel Morris and Greg Veis; nine of the magazine’s eleven active senior writers; legal-affairs editor  Jeffrey Rosen  academic  Jeffrey Rosen ; the digital-media editor; six culture writers and editors; and thirty-six out of thirty-eight contributing editors  including Paul Berman, Jonathan Chait, William Deresiewicz, Ruth Franklin, Anthony Grafton, Enrique Krauze, Ryan Lizza, Sacha Z. Scoblic, Helen Vendler, Sean Wilentz . In all, two-thirds of the names on the editorial masthead were gone. with a circulation of approximately 50,000. He published an open letter about his ""commitment"" to give the magazine ""a new mandate for a new century.""

By June 9, 2012, the ''TNR'' website's monthly page visits dropped to 421,000 in the U.S. and 521,000 globally. Straight's espionage activities began at Cambridge during the 1930s; he later claimed that they ceased during World War II. Later, shortly before serving in the Kennedy administration, he revealed his past ties and turned in fellow spy Anthony Blunt. In return for his cooperation, his own involvement was kept secret and he continued to serve in various capacities for the US Government until he retired. Straight admitted his involvement in his memoirs; however, subsequent documents obtained from the former KGB after the fall of the Soviet Union indicated that he drastically understated the extent of his espionage activities.     Stephen Glass scandal    In 1998, features writer  Stephen Glass  was revealed in a '' Forbes Forbes Digital '' investigation to have fabricated a story called ""Hack Heaven"". A ''TNR'' investigation found that most of Glass' stories had used or been based on fabricated information. The story of Glass' fall and ''TNR'' editor  Charles Lane  journalist  Chuck Lane 's handling of the scandal was dramatized in the 2003 film '' Shattered Glass  film  Shattered Glass '', based on a 1998 article in '' Vanity Fair  magazine  Vanity Fair ''. The blog was removed from the website and Siegel was suspended from writing for the print magazine. He resumed writing for ''TNR'' in April 2007. Siegel was also controversial for his coinage ""blogofascists"" which he applied to ""the entire political blogosphere"", though with an emphasis on leftwing or center-left bloggers such as  Daily Kos  and  Atrios . saying that he would ""skullfuck"" a terrorist's corpse at an editorial meeting if that was required to ""establish his anti-terrorist ''bona fides''"" and sending Foer an e-mail where he said—in what according to Ackerman was intended to be a joke—he would “make a niche in your skull” with a baseball bat. Ackerman, by contrast, argued that the dismissal was due to “irreconcilable ideological differences.” He believed that his leftward drift as a result of the Iraq War and the actions of the Bush administration was not appreciated by the senior editorial staff.

PolitiFact.com argued that this was not the case, since all health care and insurance would remain in the hands of private companies. PolitiFact determined that, though the Republican plan would make significant changes to Medicare, it would not end it. PolitiFact had originally labeled nine similar statements as ""false"" or ""pants on fire"" since April 2011.

TV critic  James Poniewozik  at '' Time  magazine  Time '' characterized PolitiFact as having the ""hard-earned and important position as referee in the mudslinging contest—a 'truth vigilante,' as it were"", and ""PolitiFact is trying to do the right thing here.

Otherwise, they’re doing exactly what they were founded to stop  using language to spread false impressions.""  In February 2011,  University of Minnesota  political science professor Eric Ostermeier analyzed 511 PolitiFact stories issued from January 2010 through January 2011. He found that the number of statements analyzed from Republicans and from Democrats was comparable, but Republicans have been assigned substantially harsher grades, receiving 'false' or 'pants on fire' more than three times as often as Democrats. Ostermeier suggested that this may indicate a bias in the selection of statements to analyze, concluding  ""The question is not whether PolitiFact will ultimately convert skeptics on the right that they do not have ulterior motives in the selection of what statements are rated, but whether the organization can give a convincing argument that either a  Republicans in fact do lie much more than Democrats, or b  if they do not, that it is immaterial that PolitiFact covers political discourse with a frame that suggests this is the case.""   Matt Welch , in the February 2013 issue of '' Reason  magazine  Reason '' magazine, criticized PolitiFact and other media fact-checkers for focusing much more on statements by politicians about their opponents, rather than statements by politicians and government officials about their own policies, thus serving as ""a check on the exercise of rhetoric"" but not ""a check on the exercise of power"".

It gained formal status in January 2015 under the Swiss Host-State Act, confirming the role of the Forum as an International Institution for Public-Private Cooperation.  There have been many other international conferences nicknamed with ""Davos"". First named the ""European Management Forum"", it changed its name to the World Economic Forum in 1987 and sought to broaden its vision to include providing a platform for resolving international conflicts.  In the summer of 1971, Schwab invited 444 executives from  Western European  firms to the first European Management Symposium held in the  Davos Congress Centre  under the patronage of the  European Commission  and European industrial associations, where Schwab sought to introduce European firms to American management practices. He then founded the WEF as a nonprofit organization based in Geneva and drew European business leaders to Davos for the annual meetings each January. Events in 1973, including the collapse of the  Bretton Woods system Bretton Woods  fixed-exchange rate mechanism and the  Arab–Israeli War , saw the annual meeting expand its focus from management to economic and social issues, and, for the first time, political leaders were invited to the annual meeting in January 1974.  In late 2015, the invitation was extended to include a North Korean delegation for the 2016 forum, ""in view of positive signs coming out of the country"", the WEF organizers noted. North Korea has not been attending the WEF since 1998. The invitation was accepted but after the  January 2016 North Korean nuclear test  on 6 January, the invitation was revoked, and the country's delegation was made subject to ""existing and possible forthcoming sanctions"".  In 2018, Indian Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  gave the plenary speech, becoming the first head of state from India to deliver the inaugural keynote for the annual meet at Davos. Modi highlighted climate change, terrorism and protectionism as the three major global challenges, and expressed confidence that they can be tackled with collective effort.  Environmental concerns like extreme weather events, and the failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation were among the top-ranking global risks expressed by WEF attendees.  The World Economic Forum strives to be  impartial  and is not tied to any political,  partisan  political  partisan , or national interests. The foundation is ""committed to improving the State of the World"".  The Managing Board is chaired by the Forum's President,  Børge Brende , and acts as the executive body of the World Economic Forum. Managing Board members are W. Lee Howell, Jeremy Jurgens, Cheryl Martin, Adrian Monck, Philipp Rösler, Richard Samans, Olivier Schwab, Murat Sönmez and Alois Zwinggi.

This set of recommendations, endorsed by a global group of CEOs, was presented to leaders ahead of the G8 Summit in  Toyako  and  Hokkaido  held in July 2008.

They promote common ideas, and serve common interests  their own.""     History of criticism    During the late 1990s the foundation, along with the  G7 ,  World Bank ,  World Trade Organization , and  International Monetary Fund , came under heavy criticism by  anti-globalization  activists who claimed that capitalism and globalization were increasing poverty and destroying the environment. Ten thousand demonstrators disrupted the World Economic Forum in  Melbourne , obstructing the path of two hundred delegates to the meeting. Around 150  Tibetan people Tibetans  and  Uyghurs Uighurs  protested in  Geneva  and 400 Tibetans in  Bern  against the visit of the Chinese  President Xi  for the 2017 meeting, with subsequent confrontations and arrests.   At the 2019 meeting, the Oxfam director presented another report claiming that the gap between rich and poor has only increased. The report “Public Good or Private Wealth” stated that 2,200 billionaires worldwide saw their wealth grow by 12 percent while the poorest half saw its wealth fall by 11 percent. Oxfam calls for a global tax overhaul to increase and harmonise global tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals. The tight security measures around the campus of Davos have kept demonstrators from the Alpine resort, and most demonstrations were held in  Zürich ,  Bern , or  Basel .

Public Eye Awards is a public competition of the worst corporations in the world. In 2011, more than 50,000 people voted for companies that acted irresponsibly. At a ceremony at a Davos hotel, the ""winners"" in 2011 were named as Indonesian  palm oil  diesel maker,  Neste Oil  in Finland, and mining company  AngloGold Ashanti  in South Africa. they are people who ""have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the élite's global operations"". In his 2004 article ""Dead Souls  The Denationalization of the American Elite"", Huntington argues that this international perspective is a minority elitist position not shared by the nationalist majority of the people.     Gender debate     Since 2011, the World Economic Forum has been addressing its very own  Women in government#Quotas gender quota , to introduce at least one woman for every five senior executives that attended. Female participation increased from 9% to 15% between 2001 and 2005. In 2016, 18% of the WEF attendees were female; this number increased to 21% in 2017. referring to it as the ""bell jar"". Although internationally connected, each country's elite lives in a  bell jar  in the sense of being out of touch with its own populace. Their isolation fosters a tendency to be oblivious to the fate of their fellow citizens.

The Commercial Radio Institute, by then a division of Chesapeake Television Corporation, later founded WPTT  channel 22, now  WPNT   in  Pittsburgh , in 1978; and  WTTE   channel 28  in  Columbus, Ohio , in 1984. All three stations originally were  independent station  North America  independents , though WBFF and WTTE became charter affiliates of the  Fox Broadcasting Company  at its launch in 1986, while the Fox affiliation in Pittsburgh went to higher-rated  WPGH-TV , which would later be purchased by Sinclair in 1990.     Sinclair Broadcast Group        1985–2010      File Sinclair Broadcast Group Logo.svg thumb Sinclair Broadcast Group logo  1985–2017   Smith's son David D. Smith began taking a more active role in the company in the 1980s. In 1985, the Chesapeake Television Corporation changed its name to the '''Sinclair Broadcast Group'''. In 1990, David Smith and his three brothers bought their parents' remaining stock and went on a buying spree that eventually made it one of the largest station owners in the country, through the purchases of groups such as  Act III Broadcasting   in 1995  and  River City Broadcasting   in 1996 .  Sinclair pioneered the concept of the  local marketing agreement   LMA  in American television in 1991, when it sold WPTT to its  general manager  Eddie Edwards  founder of Glencairn, Ltd., the Sinclair-affiliated licensee that would eventually become  Cunningham Broadcasting   in order to purchase fellow Pittsburgh station  WPGH-TV  to comply with FCC ownership rules of the time that prohibited  Duopoly  broadcasting  duopolies , while agreeing to allow Sinclair to retain operational responsibilities for the station. However, while LMAs would become an integral part of the company's business model in subsequent years, Sinclair's plans to acquire  KOKH-TV  in  Oklahoma City  through Glencairn, which would subsequently attempt to sell five of its 11 existing LMA-operated stations to Sinclair outright in turn  with Sinclair stock included in the deal  was challenged by the  Rainbow/PUSH  coalition  headed by  Jesse Jackson   to the  Federal Communications Commission   FCC  in 1998, citing concerns over a single company controlling two broadcast licenses in the same market in violation of FCC rules. The coalition argued that Glencairn passed itself off as a minority-owned company  Edwards is  African American   which, since the Smith family controlled most of the company's stock, was technically a Sinclair arm that planned to use the LMA with KOKH to gain control of the station and create an illegal duopoly with  KOCB . However, the company seemingly recovered its financial fortunes enough, as it would begin a major string of acquisitions involving television stations and other properties two years later.      2011–13     On September 8, 2011, Sinclair entered into an agreement to purchase all of the assets of  Four Points Media Group  from  Cerberus Capital Management  for $200 million. The station was subsequently sold to Manhan Media, who entered into a shared services agreement with Sinclair. Deerfield Media also acquired  Beaumont, Texas  Fox affiliate  KBTV-TV  from Nexstar. Following the acquisition, Sinclair-owned  KFDM  took over its operations under a shared services agreement. Sinclair operates the former Cox and Barrington stations through a subsidiary, Chesapeake Television, which focuses on smaller markets; On April 23, TTBG had filed to sell a seventh station,  KDBC-TV  in El Paso, Texas, to Cunningham Broadcasting, On July 29, 2013, Sinclair agreed to acquire seven television stations owned by  Allbritton Communications  for $985 million. Allbritton sold the stations in order to refocus on its '' Politico '' website and newspaper. In addition to the television stations  all of which are affiliated with ABC  including  Washington, D.C.  flagship station  WJLA-TV , the deal included a regional  United States cable news cable news  channel in Washington, D.C.,  NewsChannel 8  cable channel  NewsChannel 8 , which Sinclair has indicated may be the base for a larger expansion in cable news. In July of that year, Sinclair announced the launch of the  American Sports Network   ASN  service, operating within its Sinclair Networks company. This service, which produces and distributes  college sports  broadcasts, is primarily carried on Sinclair stations. The purchase of KSNV's non-license assets was completed on November 1, 2014. Sinclair's news operations had launched six  Unmanned aerial vehicle drone  teams in September 2016. Initial stations getting drone teams were in Washington, Baltimore, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Columbus, Ohio; Tulsa, Oklahoma and Little Rock, Arkansas. On April 21, 2017, following the reinstatement of the ""UHF discount""  a policy that counts television stations broadcasting on  UHF television broadcasting UHF  channels by 50% of their total audience towards the FCC's 39% market cap , Sinclair announced its intent to purchase  Bonten Media Group  for $240 million. To comply with  United States Department of Justice Department of Justice  antitrust and FCC ownership regulations, it was suggested that Sinclair would have to divest stations in multiple markets. In January 2019, Sinclair launched an OTT multi-channel streaming service  Stirr  providing free streaming access to local Sinclair station content as well as  On demand television on-demand  shows and movies. It was also, for a time, aired by  Destination America .  On July 1, 2017, Sinclair launched a new daily morning kids' TV block called  KidsClick , partnering with  This TV . It was part of a pitch to have reporters embedded in the Trump campaign.  In 2004, Sinclair's political slant was scrutinized by critics when it was publicized that nearly all of Sinclair's recent campaign contributions were to the  Republican Party  United States  Republican Party . In particular, the  Center for Public Integrity  showed concern that the Republican slant of Sinclair's news programming, along with Mark Hyman's past history of government lobbying  such as for the FCC to loosen rules regarding  concentration of media ownership —a factor that has assisted in the company's growth , All Sinclair stations are required to air Mr. Ephsteyn's commentary nine times per week.     Must-run segments     File DanratherGSFC.PNG thumb right Former news anchor  Dan Rather  wrote  ""News anchors looking into camera and reading a script handed down by a corporate overlord, words meant to obscure the truth not elucidate it, isn’t journalism. It’s propaganda. It’s Orwellian. A slippery slope to how despots wrest power, silence dissent, and oppress the masses."" The practice has been criticized by some of Sinclair's stations' news staff due to the viewpoints they propagate; in 1996, after CEO David Smith was arrested in a prostitution sting, he ordered Sinclair's Baltimore station  WBFF  to produce reports on a local drug counseling program as part of his community service sentence. The order was criticized by WBFF reporter LuAnne Canipe.     ''Nightline'' reading of the names    In April 2004, ABC broadcast a special episode of '' Nightline '' where host  Ted Koppel  listed the names of soldiers killed in the  2003 invasion of Iraq 2003 invasion  and subsequent  History of Iraq  2003–11  occupation  of  Iraq . The film was produced by  Carlton Sherwood , a former associate of  Tom Ridge , and accused Kerry of prolonging the Vietnam War because of his  anti-war   activism . The organization  Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , an anti-Kerry organization in the 2004 election year, was cross-promoting the film as part of a $1.4 million advertising campaign. The infomercial painted Obama as an extremist, and claimed that, during the 2008 presidential campaign, he received some campaign money from the  Hamas  terrorist group, and that Obama said in a speech, ""You want freedom? You’re gonna have to kill some crackers! You gonna have to kill some of those babies."" The special also discusses Obama advisers  Van Jones  and  John Holdren , as well as Obama staff  Anita Dunn ,  Kevin Jennings ,  Carol Browner  and  Cass Sunstein  – all in an unflattering light; in one case, the special claimed that Holdren said that trees should be permitted to sue humans in court. The infomercial aired at various times during the weekend of October 30, 2010 on Sinclair-owned stations in  WMSN-TV Madison ,  KBSI Cape Girardeau ,  WDKY-TV Lexington ,  WPGH-TV Pittsburgh ,  KDSM-TV Des Moines , and  WXLV-TV Winston-Salem  – all in  swing state s vital to the  United States elections, 2010 2010 elections .     Coverage during the 2016 presidential election campaign    On December 16, 2016,  Jared Kushner , son-in-law of then-President-elect  Donald Trump , stated that it had reached deals with Sinclair to give the company extended access to the Trump campaign, in exchange for airing, without further commentary, interviews with the Republican Party candidate on its stations, which Kushner said had a better reach than cable networks such as  CNN .  In May 2017, in response to Sinclair's announced intent to acquire Tribune Media, Craig Aaron, president/CEO of media advocacy group  Free Press  organization  Free Press , accused Sinclair of  quid pro quo currying favor  with the Trump administration through the interview arrangement with Trump, the group's February hiring of former Trump campaign aide  Boris Epshteyn  as a political analyst, and executive chair David Smith's meetings with then-FCC commissioner Ajit Pai prior to his appointment as the agency's chair in exchange for deregulating media ownership rules to allow the company to expand its broadcasting portfolio. At least 66 Sinclair-owned stations produced their own version of the message, with the first being aired on March 23, 2018. The statement cited a Monmouth University poll that found large majorities of Americans believe that traditional news media outlets report fake news. A report in '' Advertising Age '' magazine suggested that a boycott would not be easy, since it involves users first identifying the station as a Sinclair station, and then figuring out which advertisers are putting commercials on that station, and then discouraging those advertisers. This led to a protracted media battle and smear campaign between the two companies, and Sinclair pulled the two stations off of Charter's systems in the neighboring  Beckley, West Virginia  market. After several weeks of negotiations, the two companies reached an agreement which allowed WCHS-TV and WVAH-TV to continue transmission over the Suddenlink cable system. The terms of the agreement were not released to the public.  Despite a plea from Iowa's  United States Congress Congressional  delegation urging the two sides to submit to binding arbitration, Sinclair rejected the plea on January 11. On December 31, Mediacom and Sinclair agreed to an eight-day extension of the retransmission agreement that permitted Sinclair's stations to remain on Mediacom until January 8.  In November 2010, Sinclair announced that it would pull 33 of its stations in 21 cities from Time Warner Cable on January 1, 2011, if the two parties did not come to an agreement. Comcast was granted an extension to March 1, Dish and Sinclair came to an agreement on August 16, averting the removal of its any of the group's stations.     DirecTV    DirecTV's retransmission agreement with Sinclair was slated to expire on February 28, 2013. If an agreement had not been reached by that date, 87 Sinclair stations were to be blacked out by the satellite provider. Representatives for Sinclair noted that they ""...have been negotiating for quite some time in an effort to reach a new agreement, at this time it does not appear that these efforts will be successful. Although Sinclair does not believe that it is constructive to negotiate its private business relationships in public, Sinclair is informing the public in advance of the end of carriage because it is aware of the impact on a segment of the public from the end of the relationship between the Sinclair stations and DirecTV."" DirecTV stated ""we will compensate Sinclair fairly, but our customers should not be forced to pay more than twice as much for the same programs that remain available completely free of charge over the air and online.""  – a company created by Sinclair in January 2014, with the hiring of its chief operating officer Doron Gorshein. The company runs    Stirr   2019  is a free, ad-supported streaming service launched on January 16, 2019 and draws on programming from the Sinclair TV stations and other streaming live channels. Some program would be available on demand. Its main channel is Stirr City, which pulls content based on the location you select. When network programming runs on its local channel, Stirr City would provide alternative programming.     Chesapeake Television      '''Chesapeake Television''' is a subsidiary of Sinclair Broadcast Group that owns television stations in smaller markets. Chesapeake was founded in 2013, to acquire small-market stations purchased through Sinclair's run of acquisitions.  As early as January 2013, Sinclair was looking at forming a new subsidiary group for its smaller-market stations.    Circa News  Keyser Capital sold on March 7, 2017 Alarm Funding Associates, LLC to Riverside Partners' RPAFA Investors, LLC for $200 million netting pre-tax $70 million.

Sinclair has faced scrutiny from some media critics, as well as some of its station employees, for the conservative slant of their stations' news reporting and other programming decisions, and how the company's rapid growth has aided the airing of content that supports these views. Sinclair has also faced criticism over business practices that circumvent concentration of media ownership regulations, particularly the use of local marketing agreements, accusations that the company had been currying favor with the Trump administration in order to loosen these rules and about its management lacking diversity and being totally controlled by a single family.

History   The station signed on the air on October 11, 1959, as '''KXGO-TV'''  the GO for Fargo , an  American Broadcasting Company ABC  affiliate. It was originally owned by North Dakota Broadcasting. In 1963, the call letters were changed to '''KEND-TV'''. On August 13, 1963, channel 11 moved to its current tower near Blanchard. In 1964, the call letters were changed to as '''KTHI-TV'''  for '''T'''ower-'''HI''' . Fuqua sold the station to  Morgan Murphy Media   owner of  KXLY-TV  in  Spokane, Washington   in 1968. On August 22, 1983, KTHI became an NBC affiliate, swapping affiliations with longtime NBC outlet  WDAY-TV   channel 6 . The current call sign, adopted on May 2, 1995, represents the station's slogan, ""The Valley's Choice for Local News,"" as it serves the communities along the  Red River of the North  and its tributaries.  From 1968 until the mid-1980s, channel 11 was carried by  cable television cable systems  across  Manitoba  and northwestern  Ontario , including the  Winnipeg  area. When KTHI switched affiliation to NBC, it was replaced by ABC affiliate  WDAZ-TV   channel 8  in  Grand Forks, North Dakota Grand Forks , until Canadian cable companies were granted permission to replace most of the North Dakota stations with network affiliates from  Detroit .  In September 2005, ten years after changing its call sign from KTHI, KVLY became the first major network affiliate in Fargo to broadcast in  high-definition television high-definition . In May 2006, KVLY made its logo bolder to reflect the change to HDTV. KVLY is the second-most-watched television station in the Red River Valley, behind WDAY/WDAZ, which are owned by Forum Communications Company.  Meyer Broadcasting of  Bismarck, North Dakota , owner of  KFYR-TV  in  Bismarck, North Dakota Bismarck  and its network of satellites in western North Dakota, bought the station in 1995. It sold its television stations to  Smith Media Sunrise Television  in 1997. In 2002, Sunrise sold its North Dakota stations to the Wicks Group of  New York City .  Hoak Media  bought all of Wicks' television stations, including KVLY, in January 2007.

In May 2016 there was a backlash to a report they aired, promoted with the tagline ""Could Kindness Be Bad for Your Health"", implying that the kindness of letting refugees settle in the Fargo–Moorhead area could lead to an epidemic of  latent tuberculosis , a disease that isn't contagious. In his report, Bradford Arick dismissed the criticism the story was getting as people ""not even from the viewing area and may or may not be affiliated with organizations pushing an agenda"". Host of the ''Valley News Live'' program ""Point of View"", Chris Berg, devoted his full show to interviewing the resident, referring to him by his preferred title, ""pro-white activist"". Area activists took issue with this terminology, especially because ''Valley News Live'' refused to put quotes around ""pro-white activist"".

Allies of the ACLU in legal actions have included the  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , the  American Jewish Congress ,  People For the American Way , the  National Rifle Association , the  Electronic Frontier Foundation ,  Americans United for Separation of Church and State , and the  National Organization for Women .  The ACLU has been criticized by  Liberalism in the United States liberals , such as when it excluded  Communism communists  from its leadership ranks, when it defended  Neo-Nazism Neo-Nazis , when it declined to defend  Paul Robeson , or when it opposed the passage of the  National Labor Relations Act . The focus of the CLB was on  freedom of speech , primarily anti-war speech, and on supporting  conscientious objector s who did not want to serve in World War I. In '' Debs v. United States ,'' the court upheld the conviction of  Eugene Debs . While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in '' Abrams v. United States '', Justice  Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. Oliver Wendell Holmes  wrote an important dissent which has gradually been absorbed as an American principle  he urged the court to treat  freedom of speech  as a fundamental right, which should rarely be restricted. After assuming sole leadership of the CLB, Baldwin insisted that the organization be reorganized. He wanted to change its focus from litigation to direct action and public education. Baldwin was ascetic, wearing hand-me-down clothes, pinching pennies, and living on a very small salary. Right-wing conservatives wielded vast amounts of power, and activists that promoted unionization, socialism, or government reform were often denounced as un-American or unpatriotic. Another group, including  Walter Nelles  and Walter Pollak felt that lawsuits taken to the Supreme Court were the best way to achieve change. Because most of the ACLU's efforts were associated with the labor movement, the ACLU itself came under heavy attack from conservative groups, such as the  American Legion , the  National Civic Federation , and Industrial Defense Association and the Allied Patriotic Societies. The ACLU itself was banned from speaking in New York public schools in 1921. At the same time, the Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal conduct such as denying their party membership under oath. This led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU. That changed in 1925, when the ACLU persuaded  John T. Scopes  to defy Tennessee's anti- evolution  law in '' Scopes Trial The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes ''.  Clarence Darrow , a member of the ACLU National Committee, headed Scopes' legal team. The prosecution, led by  William Jennings Bryan , contended that the Bible should be interpreted literally in teaching  creationism  in school. The ACLU lost the case and Scopes was fined $100. The Tennessee Supreme Court later upheld the law but overturned the conviction on a technicality. The ACLU became well known across America, and the case led to the first endorsement of the ACLU by a major US newspaper.  The most important ACLU case of the 1920s was '' Gitlow v. New York '', in which  Benjamin Gitlow  was arrested for violating a state law against inciting anarchy and violence, when he distributed literature promoting communism. A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, and there was a growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions. Starting in 1926, the ACLU began to expand its free speech activities to encompass censorship of art and literature.  Mary Ware Dennett  was fined $300 in 1928, for distributing a pamphlet containing sex education material. The ACLU, led by Morris Ernst, appealed her conviction and won a reversal, in which judge  Learned Hand  ruled that the pamphlet's main purpose was to ""promote understanding"". In '' Near v. Minnesota '', also decided in 1931, the Supreme Court ruled that states may not exercise  prior restraint  and prevent a newspaper from publishing, simply because the newspaper had a reputation for being scandalous. National leaders hailed the  United States Bill of Rights Bill of Rights , particularly as it protected minorities, as the essence of democracy.  The ACLU played a major role in passing the 1932  Norris–La Guardia Act , a federal law which prohibited employers from preventing employees from joining unions, and stopped the practice of outlawing strikes, unions, and labor organizing activities with the use of injunctions. Funded by the  Garland Fund , the ACLU also participated in producing the influential  Margold Report , which outlined a strategy to fight for civil rights for blacks. But the  Great Depression  brought new assaults on civil liberties; the year 1930 saw a large increase in the number of free speech prosecutions, a doubling of the number of lynchings, and all meetings of unemployed persons were banned in Philadelphia. Roosevelt was not personally interested in civil rights, but did appoint many  civil libertarianism civil libertarians  to key positions, including Interior Secretary  Harold L. Ickes Harold Ickes , a member of the ACLU. Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned; as was '' Life  magazine  Life '' magazine's April 11, 1938 issue which included photos of the birth process. The ACLU fought these bans, but did not prevail.  The ACLU took no official position on president Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1937  court-packing plan , which threatened to increase the number of Supreme Court justices, unless the Supreme Court reversed its course and began approving New Deal legislation. The ACLU attorney  Osmond Fraenkel , working with  International Labor Defense , defended De Jonge in 1937, and won a major victory when the Supreme Court ruled that ""peaceable assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made a crime."" The newly formed  National Labor Relations Board   NLRB  posed a dilemma for the ACLU, because in 1937 it issued an order to  Henry Ford , prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti-union literature. Until 1937, the ACLU felt that civil rights were best upheld by citizens and private organizations. Other ACLU members wanted the ACLU to shift focus into the political arena, and to be more willing to compromise their ideals in order to strike deals with politicians. This initiative was also rejected by the ACLU leadership. Cases that the ACLU supported included '' Lovell v. City of Griffin ''  which struck down a city ordinance that required a permit before a person could distribute ""literature of any kind"" ; '' Martin v. Struthers ''  which struck down an ordinance prohibiting door-to-door canvassing ; and '' Cantwell v. Connecticut ''  which reversed the conviction of a Witness who was reciting offensive speech on a street corner . But three years later, in '' West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette '', the Supreme court reversed itself and wrote ""If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein."" To underscore its decision, the Supreme Court announced it on  Flag Day  United States  Flag Day .  The ACLU leadership was divided over whether or not to defend pro- Nazi  speech in the United States; pro-labor elements within the ACLU were hostile towards Nazism and fascism, and objected when the ACLU defended Nazis. The ACLU benefited because affiliates from the Popular Front could often fight local civil rights battles much more effectively than the New York-based ACLU. When witnesses testified at its hearings, the ACLU was mentioned several times, leading the HUAC to mention the ACLU prominently in its 1939 report. The ACLU was one of the few organizations to protest  unsuccessfully  against passage of the  Smith Act  in 1940, which would later be used to imprison many persons who supported Communism. A bitter struggle ensued throughout 1939, and the anti-Communists prevailed in February 1940, when the board voted to prohibit anyone who supported totalitarianism from ACLU leadership roles. Ward immediately resigned, andfollowing a contentious six-hour debateFlynn was voted off the ACLU's board. Chicago and New York proclaimed ""Civil Rights"" weeks, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt announced a national Bill of Rights day.  Eleanor Roosevelt  was the keynote speaker at the 1939 ACLU convention. The most significant exception was the  internment of Japanese Americans . The ACLU immediately protested to Roosevelt, comparing the evacuations to Nazi concentration camps. However, the San Francisco branch, led by  Ernest Besig , refused to discontinue its support for  Fred Korematsu , whose case had been taken on prior to the June 22 directive, and attorney  Wayne M. Collins Wayne Collins , with Besig's full support, centered his defense on the illegality of Korematsu's exclusion. although it had earlier forced its local office in L.A. to stop aiding Hirabayashi, the ACLU donated $1,000 to the case  over a third of the legal team's total budget  and submitted an  Amicus brief ''amicus'' brief . Besig, dissatisfied with  Osmond Fraenkel 's tamer defense, filed an additional ''amicus'' brief that directly addressed Hirabayashi's constitutional rights. In the meantime, A.L. Wirin served as one of the attorneys in '' Yasui v. United States ''  decided the same day as the Hirabayashi case, and with the same results , but he kept his arguments within the perimeters established by the national office. The only case to receive a favorable ruling, '' ex parte Endo '', was also aided by two ''amicus'' briefs from the ACLU, one from the more conservative Fraenkel and another from the more putative Wayne Collins. although Korematsu's, Hirabayashi's and Yasui's convictions were later overturned in '' coram nobis '' proceedings in the 1980s. Included in this group were the thousands of Nisei who  Renunciation Act of 1944 renounced their US citizenship  during the war but later regretted the decision and tried to revoke their applications for ""repatriation.""  A significant number of those slated to ""go back"" to Japan had never actually been to the country and were in fact being deported rather than repatriated.  Ernest Besig had in 1944 visited the  Tule Lake Unit, World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument Tule Lake Segregation Center , where the majority of these ""renunciants"" were concentrated, and subsequently enlisted Wayne Collins' help to file a lawsuit on their behalf, arguing the renunciations had been given under duress. The national organization prohibited local branches from representing the renunciants, forcing Collins to pursue the case on his own, although Besig and the Northern California office provided some support. President  Harry S. Truman  sent a congratulatory telegram to the ACLU on the occasion of their 25th anniversary.     Cold War era    Anti-Communist sentiment gripped the United States during the  Cold War  beginning in 1946. Federal investigations caused many persons with Communist or left-leaning affiliations to lose their jobs, become blacklisted, or be jailed. This ambivalent state of affairs would last until 1954, when the civil liberties faction prevailed, leading to the resignation of most of the anti-Communist leaders. Any association with these programs was ground for barring the person from employment. The Hollywood establishment panicked after the HUAC hearings, and created a  blacklist  which prohibited anyone with leftist associations from working. The ACLU supported legal challenges to the blacklist, but those challenges failed. The case hinged on whether or not mere membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government. The ACLU issued a public condemnation of the ''Dennis'' decision, and resolved to fight it. The ACLU supported many of the Communists during their appeals  although most of the initiative originated with local ACLU affiliates, not the national headquarters  but most convictions were upheld. California ACLU affiliates successfully challenged the California state loyalty oath. Several ACLU leaders were sympathetic to the FBI, and as a consequence, the ACLU rarely investigated any of the many complaints alleging abuse of power by the FBI during the Cold War.     Organizational change    In 1950, the ACLU board of directors asked executive director Baldwin to resign, feeling that he lacked the organizational skills to lead the 9,000  and growing  member organization. Baldwin objected, but a majority of the board elected to remove him from the position, and he was replaced by  Patrick Murphy Malin . A bi-annual conference, open to the entire membership, was instituted in the same year, and in later decades it became a pulpit for activist members, who suggested new directions for the ACLU, including abortion rights, death penalty, and rights of the poor. The ACLU later reversed their stance, and supported  William Worthy  and  Rockwell Kent  in their passport confiscation cases, which resulted in legal victories in the late 1950s. Government agencies and private organizations, in response, established policies which inferred communist party membership for anyone who invoked the fifth amendment. In 1953, the anti-communists, led by  Norman Thomas  and  James Fly , proposed a set of resolutions that inferred guilt of persons that invoked the fifth amendment. The controversies over the Bill of Rights that were generated by the Cold War ushered in a new era in American Civil liberties. In 1954, in '' Brown v. Board of Education '', the Supreme Court unanimously overturned state-sanctioned school segregation, and thereafter a flood of civil rights victories dominated the legal landscape. In 1965, the Supreme Court produced some decisions, including '' Lamont v. Postmaster General ''  in which the plaintiff was  Corliss Lamont , a former ACLU board member , which upheld fifth amendment protections and brought an end to restrictions on political activity. Membership rose from 30,000 to 80,000, and by 1965 it had affiliates in seventeen states. The Catholic church was a leading proponent of such laws; and the primary opponents  the ""separationists""  were the ACLU,  Americans United for Separation of Church and State , and the  American Jewish Congress . In the 1960s, the ACLU, in response to member insistence, turned its attention to in-class promotion of religion. In 1948, the New York affiliate of the ACLU received mixed results from the Supreme Court, winning the appeal of  Carl Jacob Kunz , who was convicted for speaking without a police permit, but losing the appeal of  Irving Feiner  who was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace, based on his oration denouncing president Truman and the American Legion. The film '' L'Amore  film  The Miracle '' was banned in New York in 1951, at the behest of the Catholic Church, but the ACLU supported the film's distributor in an appeal of the ban, and won a major victory in the 1952 decision '' Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson ''.  The ACLU lost an  Roth v. United States important press censorship case  when, in 1957, the Supreme Court upheld the obscenity conviction of publisher  Samuel Roth  for distributing adult magazines. Several civil liberties organizations worked together for progress, including the  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People   NAACP , the ACLU, and the  American Jewish Congress . Southern states instituted a McCarthyism-style witch-hunt against the NAACP, attempting it to disclose membership lists. The ACLU's fight against racism was not limited to segregation; in 1964 the ACLU provided key support to plaintiffs, primarily lower income urban residents, in '' Reynolds v. Sims '', which required states to establish the voting districts in accordance with the ""one person, one vote"" principle. In the late 1940s, several ACLU local affiliates established permanent committees to address policing issues. The '' Gideon v. Wainwright '' decision in 1963 provided legal representation to indigents. Civil liberties actions in the 1960s were often led by young people, and often employed tactics such as  sit in s and marches. Protests were often peaceful, but sometimes employed militant tactics. During 1960–61, the ACLU defended black students arrested for demonstrating in North Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. But it fell to the ACLU and other legal volunteer efforts to provide legal representation to hundreds of protestorswhite and blackwho were arrested while protesting in the South. Much of the ACLU's progress in the South was due to  Charles Morgan, Jr. , the charismatic leader of the Atlanta office. He was responsible for desegregating juries  '' Whitus v. Georgia '' , desegregating prisons  '' Lee v. Washington '' , and  Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction era reforming election laws .     Vietnam War    The ACLU was at the center of several legal aspects of the Vietnam war  defending  draft resister s, challenging the constitutionality of the war, the  Watergate scandal potential impeachment of Richard Nixon , and the use of national security concerns to preemptively  Censorship censor  newspapers.  David J. Miller was the first person prosecuted for burning his  draft card . The New York affiliate of the ACLU appealed his 1965 conviction  367 F.2d 72  ''United States of America v. David J. Miller'', 1966 , but the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal. Two years later, the Massachusetts affiliate took the card-burning case of David O'Brien to the Supreme Court, arguing that the act of burning was a form of symbolic speech, but the Supreme Court upheld the conviction in '' United States v. O'Brien '', 391 US 367  1968 . The ACLU successfully defended Paul Cohen, who was arrested for wearing a jacket with the words ""fuck the draft"" on its back, while he walked through the Los Angeles courthouse. The Supreme Court, in '' Cohen v. California '', held that the vulgarity of the wording was essential to convey the intensity of the message. After the  Kent State shootings  in 1970, ACLU leaders took another step towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal. Historically, the ACLU was known for its appellate work which led to landmark Supreme Court decisions, but by 1968, 90% of the ACLU's legal activities involved direct representation. The symposium concluded that both roles were valid for the ACLU.  As the  Watergate scandal Watergate  saga unfolded, the ACLU became the first national organization to call for Nixon's impeachment.  During those years, the ACLU led the way in expanding legal rights in three directions  new rights for persons within government-run ""enclaves"", new rights for victim groups, and privacy rights for mainstream citizens.  As early as 1945, the ACLU had taken a stand to protect the rights of the mentally ill, when it drafted a model statute governing mental commitments. That changed in the late 1950s, when the ACLU began representing prisoners that were subject to police brutality, or deprived of religious reading material. She was later appointed to the  Supreme Court of the United States  by President  Bill Clinton .   The ACLU, during the 1960s and 1970s, expanded its scope to include what it referred to as ""victim groups"", namely women, the poor, and  homosexual s. This support continues even today. After then-Senator  Larry Craig  was arrested for soliciting sex in a public restroom, the ACLU wrote an amicus brief for Craig, saying that sex between consenting adults in public places was protected under privacy rights. The ACLU played a key role in the 1968 '' King v. Smith '' decision, where the Supreme Court ruled that welfare benefits for children could not be denied by a state simply because the mother cohabited with a boyfriend. Often the American Civil Liberties Union is the group to stand up for an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, race, or class, even when they are not the popular opinion. In some cases, Reproductive Freedom Programs fund ultrasounds and abortions and any lodging, meals, or transportation that go with that. and  3  to ""stop the elimination of vital reproductive health services as a result of hospital mergers and health care networks"". The New York affiliate of the ACLU pushed to eliminate  Opposition to the legalization of abortion anti-abortion laws  starting in 1964, a year before ''Griswold'' was decided, and in 1967 the ACLU itself formally adopted the  Support for the legalization of abortion right to abortion  as a policy.     Allegations of bias    In the early 1970s, conservatives and  Libertarianism libertarians  began to criticize the ACLU for being too political and too liberal. The ACLU has defended American Nazis many times, and their actions often brought protests, particularly from American Jews. Skokie immediately passed three ordinances aimed at preventing the group from meeting in Skokie. The ACLU assisted Collin and appealed to federal court.  In 1982, the ACLU became involved in a case involving the distribution of  child pornography   '' New York v. Ferber '' . In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the  three prong obscenity test  should be outlawed, but that the law in question was overly restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. The court did not adopt the ACLU's position. The phrase subsequently was used by the organization in an advertising campaign.  In 2000, Marvin Johnson, a legislative counsel for the ACLU, stated that proposed anti- Spamming spam  legislation infringed on free speech by denying anonymity and by forcing spam to be labeled as such, ""Standardized labeling is compelled speech."" He also stated, ""It's relatively simple to click and delete."" The 2009 film '' American Violet '' depicts this case. Also in 2000, the ACLU lost the '' Boy Scouts of America v. Dale '' case, which had asked the Supreme Court to require the  Boy Scouts of America  to drop their policy of prohibiting homosexuals from becoming Boy Scout leaders. The ACLU,  Lambda Legal  and the  National Center for Lesbian Rights  then challenged   California Proposition 8  2008  Proposition 8  In June 2004, the  Dover Area School District school district  in  Dover, Pennsylvania , required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of  evolution  is not fact and mentioning  intelligent design  as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the  Establishment Clause  of the  First Amendment to the United States Constitution First Amendment . The ACLU, joined by  Americans United for Separation of Church and State , represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge  John E. Jones III  ruled in favor of the parents in the '' Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District '' decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes. On September 20, 2006, the Los Angeles City Council voted to reject the compromise. In 2012, the ACLU sued the same library system for refusing to temporarily, at the request of an adult patron, disable Internet filters which blocked access to  Google Images . Since 2008, the ACLU has increasingly assisted gun owners in recovering firearms that have been seized illegally by law enforcement. This stance on the landmark ''Citizens United'' case caused considerable disagreement within the organization, resulting in a discussion about its future stance during a quarterly board meeting in 2010.  In 2011, the ACLU started its  Don't Filter Me  project, countering  LGBT -related  Internet censorship  in  State school#United States public schools  in the United States. Some 181 were expected to receive about $13,000 each.   During the ensuing debate regarding the proper balance of civil liberties and security, the membership of the ACLU increased by 20%, bringing the group's total enrollment to 330,000. The campaign imposed a requirement that ACLU employees must be checked against a federal anti-terrorism watch list. The ACLU has stated that it would ""reject $500,000 in contributions from private individuals rather than submit to a government 'blacklist' policy."" On August 17, 2006, that court ruled that the warrantless wiretapping program is unconstitutional and ordered it ended immediately. and two others in California requesting injunctions against  AT&T  and  Verizon Communications Verizon . In January 2010, the  American military  released the names of 645 detainees held at the  Bagram Theater Internment Facility  in  Afghanistan , modifying its long-held position against publicizing such information. This list was prompted by a  Freedom of Information Act  United States  Freedom of Information Act  lawsuit filed in September 2009 by the ACLU, whose lawyers had also requested detailed information about conditions, rules and regulations.

Shooting of Jocques Clemmons    The ACLU of Tennessee protested the  shooting of Jocques Clemmons  which occurred in  Nashville, Tennessee  on February 10, 2017. The ACLU had previously defended the free speech rights of the KKK and Nazis.  The law prohibited sidewalk counselors from approaching women outside abortion facilities and offering them alternatives to abortion but allowed escorts to speak with them and accompany them into the building.

Officially  nonpartisan, the organization has been supported and criticized by liberal and conservative organizations alike. The ACLU works through litigation and lobbying and it has over 1,200,000 members and an annual budget of over $100 million. Local affiliates of the ACLU are active in almost all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The ACLU provides legal assistance in cases when it considers civil liberties to be at risk. Legal support from the ACLU can take the form of direct legal representation or preparation of amicus curiae briefs expressing legal arguments when another law firm is already providing representation. In addition to representing persons and organizations in lawsuits, the ACLU lobbies for policy positions that have been established by its board of directors. Current positions of the ACLU include  opposing the death penalty; supporting same-sex marriage and the right of LGBT people to adopt; supporting birth control and abortion rights; eliminating discrimination against women, minorities, and LGBT people; supporting the rights of prisoners and opposing torture; and opposing government preference for religion over non-religion, or for particular faiths over others. Legally, the ACLU consists of two separate but closely affiliated nonprofit organizations  the American Civil Liberties Union, a 501 c  4  social welfare group, and the ACLU Foundation, a 501 c  3  public charity. Both organizations engage in civil rights litigation, advocacy, and education, but only donations to the 501 c  3  foundation are tax deductible, and only the 501 c  4  group can engage in unlimited political lobbying.

Although women initiated and lead the group, Code Pink encourages people of all genders to participate in its activities.  In February 2003, just weeks before the invasion of Iraq, Code Pink organized its first trip to that nation, and subsequently led five delegations there. These delegations included parents who had lost their children in Iraq, and parents of active soldiers. Additionally, they brought six Iraqi women on a tour of the United States, and published a report about how the U.S. occupation affected the  Women's rights in Iraq status of Iraqi women .  On its website, Code Pink lists allegations of U.S. war crimes, and states that thousands of civilians were killed in  Fallujah  in 2004 due to the actions of the U.S. military. To those that faulted aggressive chants and signs, Code Pink responded that certain of the disruptive protesters were not part of their group and that they have asked these protesters to be respectful.   In an interview on Carlson's  MSNBC  show, Benjamin was asked, ""Do you want to revise that given the news that Hugo Chávez has closed the last nationally broadcast opposition television station for criticizing him?"" Benjamin replied that it was not true and that Chávez simply did not renew the license because the station ""participated in a coup against a democratically elected government, his [Chavez's] government."" Benjamin also said "" Peru  recently did not renew a license.  Uruguay  didn't renew a license. Why do you hold Venezuela to a different standard?"" This campaign was a response to the Obama administration's continued and increased use of unmanned drones in the ""war on terror,"" specifically in regions surrounding Pakistan and Afghanistan.  Code Pink claimed that many of the drone strikes intended to target terrorist leaders and strongholds often miss their targets, causing the unnecessary deaths of innocent civilians.  In August 2013, Code Pink's national coordinator, Alli McCracken, disrupted the annual Aerial Unmanned Vehicles Systems Integrated summit, in Washington, DC.  During a speech advocating the full automation of unmanned drones, McCracken interrupted by shouting “Are you going to talk about the innocent people who have been killed by the drones?,” while producing a ""STOP KILLER DRONES"" banner, until she was escorted out by security. The event gained some notoriety when complaints surfaced about Reuters' characterization of their protest as ""taunting"" children, a characterization that Reuters stood by. Prior to the march, Benjamin said the Hamas government had ""pledged to ensure our safety."" Other members of the international delegation, including American, French, Belgian, and British citizens, who arrived the next day were also deported. Some members made it into Cairo, although no one from the delegation made it to Gaza.    National Rifle Association Protest 2012   Code Pink protesters were present at the  National Rifle Association 's  NRA  first press conference following the  Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting , where NRA's Executive Vice President  Wayne LaPierre  advocated placing armed guards in schools and said ""The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.""    Arrest during Jeff Sessions confirmation hearing   Code Pink member Desiree Fairooz was arrested for laughing after a description of Senator  Jeff Sessions  by Alabama U.S. Senator  Richard Shelby  of the nominee as having a history of his ""treating all Americans equally under the law is clear and well-documented,"" during the January 2017 confirmation hearing as  United States Attorney General . After she had been convicted at trial, that verdict was reversed by the chief District Court Judge Robert Morin. The judge said Fairooz should not have been tried for laughing, only for speaking out as she was being removed, and called a mistrial. Instead of dismissing the case, Morin set her retrial for September.

This left Champaign with only one daily newspaper for the first time. The two papers had long been equally alike, as both were afternoon newspapers. The Courier focused on news specifically from Urbana.  From its founding until June 2009, The News-Gazette published its main edition in the afternoon. The paper was well known in the area as being one of the only afternoon papers left. Beginning in the late 1990s, the paper printed an edition specifically geared towards Champaign and Urbana that was published in the morning. Due to the decreasing revenue from print advertising, ''The News-Gazette'' switched to morning publication only on June 1, 2009.  Since 1937, it has been co-owned with the area's oldest commercial radio station,  WDWS .  An FM sister was added in 1949; it is now  WHMS .

It argues that the CPI embeds a powerful and misleading elite bias in popular perceptions of corruption, potentially contributing to a vicious cycle and at the same time incentivizing inappropriate policy responses. Cobham writes, ""the index corrupts perceptions to the extent that it's hard to see a justification for its continuing publication.""  In the United States, many lawyers advise international businesses to consult the CPI when attempting to measure the risk of  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  violations in different nations. This practice has been criticized by the ''Minnesota Journal of International Law'', which wrote that since the CPI may be subject to perceptual biases it therefore should not be considered by lawyers to be a measure of actual national corruption risk.

Anxiety disorder is the class of mental disorder in which anxiety is the predominant feature. This disorder, an illness characterized by constant and boundless worry that interferes with the daily life, is the most common psychiatric illness in the United States, affecting 40 million American adults. Furthermore, anxiety stems from a complex arrangement of factors such as life experiences, personality, brain chemistry, or even genetics, so as a developing, mental disorder, anxiety requires patience to overcome. It was officially incorporated on December 1, 1980.  In 1980 a small group emerged and founded the Phobia Society of America  PSA  which is what it was primarily called, they promoted awareness of treatments for phobias. In 1990 the PSA changed their name to the Anxiety Disorders Association of America, often referred as ADAA.  From a pool of callers to the ADAA, 1000 individuals were selected to answer a 97 item questionnaire in order to ascertain information relating to social anxiety disorder, as well as sub-threshold social anxiety disorder. The ADAA found that those individuals suffering from SAD were likely to be younger in age, unmarried, and in lower income brackets than those non-sufferers in the control group. The ADAA found that sufferers of SAD made more extensive use of the health care system, and were also disadvantaged in many ways. In light of these facts, the ADAA strives to bring about public consciousness of the mental health issue and highlight the importance of early diagnosis and effective treatment, with the broad goal of improving people's lives.

The paper benefited from the growth of  San Francisco  and was the largest circulation newspaper on the  West Coast of the United States  by 1880. Like many other newspapers, it has experienced a rapid fall in circulation in the early 21st century, and was ranked 24th by circulation nationally for the six months to March 2010.

Audrey Cooper  was named editor-in-chief in January 2015 and is the first woman to hold the position.  The editorial page editor is John Diaz. The Chronicle's free and breaking news website, SFGATE is managed by executive producer Brandon M. Mercer, who also oversees the '' Seattle Post-Intelligencer ''.

Fainaru-Wada and Williams were recognized for their work on uncovering the  BALCO  scandal, which linked  San Francisco Giants  star  Barry Bonds  to performance-enhancing drugs. While the two above-named reporters broke the news, they are by no means the only sports writers of note at the ''Chronicle''. The ''Chronicle''s sports section, edited by Al Saracevic and called ''Sporting Green'' as it is printed on green-tinted pages, is staffed by a dozen writers. The section's best-known writers are its columnists  Bruce Jenkins, Ann Killion, Scott Ostler, Saracevic and Tom Stienstra.

The ''Chronicle'''s daily readership dropped by 16.6% between 2004 and 2005 to 400,906; The cuts were made.  In spite of, or perhaps because of the threats, the loss of readers and advertisers accelerated. On October 26, 2009, the Audit Bureau of Circulations reported that the ''Chronicle'' had suffered a 25.8% drop in circulation for the six-month period ending September 2009, to 251,782 subscribers, the largest percentage drop in circulation of any major newspaper in the United States.

He served as the ninth  White House Press Secretary  under the  Lyndon B. Johnson Administration Johnson administration  from 1965 to 1967. He also worked as a network TV news commentator for ten years. Moyers has been extensively involved with  public broadcasting , producing documentaries and news journal programs. He has won numerous awards and honorary degrees for his investigative journalism and civic activities. He has become well-known as a trenchant critic of the corporately structured  U.S. news media .    Life and career       Early years and education     Image BillMoyers LBJ 1963B.jpg 130px thumbnail right President Johnson  right  meets with special assistant Moyers in the  White House   Oval Office , 1963  Born Billy Don Moyers     Kennedy and Johnson administrations    During the  John F. Kennedy Kennedy Administration , Moyers was first appointed as associate director of public affairs for the newly created  Peace Corps  in 1961. He served as Deputy Director from 1962 to 1963.  When  Lyndon B. Johnson  took office after the  Assassination of John F. Kennedy Kennedy assassination , Moyers became a special assistant to Johnson, serving from 1963 to 1967. Moyers is the last surviving person identifiable in the photograph taken of Johnson's  First inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson#Love Field, Dallas first inauguration on Air Force One . He played a key role in organizing and supervising the 1964  Great Society  legislative task forces and was a principal architect of Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign. Moyers acted as the President's informal chief of staff from October 1964 until 1966. From July 1965 to February 1967, he also served as  White House press secretary . ordered Moyers to request  FBI Name Check FBI name checks  on 15 members of  Barry Goldwater Goldwater's  staff to find ""derogatory"" material on their personal lives. Moyers indicated his memory was unclear on why Johnson directed him to request such information, ""but that he may have been simply looking for details of allegations first brought to the president by  J. Edgar Hoover Hoover ."" Goldwater blamed him for it, and once said of Moyers, ""Every time I see him, I get sick to my stomach and want to throw up."" During the meeting, Safer alleges, Johnson threatened to expose Safer's ""communist ties"". This was a bluff, according to Safer. Safer says that Moyers was ""if not a key player, certainly a key bystander"" in the incident.  Moyers has consistently refused to discuss his experience in the Johnson administration with Robert A. Caro, Johnson's most famous biographer. but Moyers led the paper in a progressive direction,      CBS News     In 1976 he moved to  CBS , where he worked as editor and chief correspondent for ''CBS Reports'' until 1980, then as senior news analyst and commentator for the '' CBS Evening News  with  Dan Rather '' from 1981 to 1986. He was the last regular commentator for the network broadcast. Moyers and Campbell discuss the relationship between Campbell's theories and Lucas's creative work. Twelve years after the making of ''The Power of Myth'', Moyers and Lucas met again for the 1999 interview, the ''Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas & Bill Moyers'', to further discuss the impact of Campbell's work on Lucas's films.      ''A World of Ideas''     In 1988, Moyers produced an interview series featuring writers, artists, philosophers, scientists, and historians he had become acquainted with. The series broke new ground for national television by bringing thoughtful, intelligent, provocative, and noteworthy people to the screen, most of whom had little prior exposure in the mass media.      ''Faith and Reason''     In 2006, he presented two public television series. ''Faith and Reason'', a series of conversations with esteemed writers of various faiths and of no faith, explored the question ""In a world in which religion is poison to some and salvation to others, how do we live together?""      ''Moyers on America''     The series, ''Moyers on America'', analyzed in depth the ramifications of three important issues  the  Jack Abramoff  scandal, evangelical religion and environmentalism   Evangelical environmentalism  , and threats to open public access of the Internet.      ''Bill Moyers Journal''     On April 25, 2007, Moyers returned to PBS with '' Bill Moyers Journal ''. In the first episode, ""Buying the War"", Moyers investigated what he called the general media's shortcomings in the runup to the  Iraq War War in Iraq .      ''Moyers & Company''     In August 2011 Moyers announced a new hour-long weekly interview show, '' Moyers & Company '', which premiered in January 2012.       Awards      In 1995, Bill Moyers was inducted into the  Television Hall of Fame . Moyers said, ""The corporate right and the political right declared class warfare on working people a quarter of a century ago and they've won."" He noted, ""The rich are getting richer, which arguably wouldn't matter if the rising tide lifted all boats."" Instead, however, ""[t]he inequality gap is the widest it's been since 1929; the middle class is besieged and the working poor are barely keeping their heads above water."" He added that as ""the corporate and governing elites are helping themselves to the spoils of victory,"" access to political power has become ""who gets what and who pays for it.""  Meanwhile, the public has failed to react because it is, in his words, ""distracted by the media circus and news has been neutered or politicized for partisan purposes."" In support of this, he referred to ""the paradox of Rush Limbaugh, ensconced in a Palm Beach mansion massaging the resentments across the country of white-knuckled wage earners, who are barely making ends meet in no small part because of the corporate and ideological forces for whom Rush has been a hero. ... As Eric Alterman reports in his recent book—a book that I'm proud to have helped make happen—part of the red-meat strategy is to attack mainstream media relentlessly, knowing that if the press is effectively intimidated, either by the accusation of liberal bias or by a reporter's own mistaken belief in the charge's validity, the institutions that conservatives revere—corporate America, the military, organized religion, and their own ideological bastions of influence—will be able to escape scrutiny and increase their influence over American public life with relatively no challenge.""     On Karl Rove and U.S. politics    ;""The Progressive Story of America"" speech On June 4, 2003, Moyers gave a speech at the ""Take Back America"" conference. In it, Moyers defined what he considered   Karl Rove 's influence on  George W. Bush 's administration. Moyers asserted that, from his reading of Rove, the mid-to-late 19th century was to Rove a ""cherished period of American history."" He further stated, ""From his own public comments and my reading of the record, it is apparent that Karl Rove has modeled the Bush presidency on that of  William McKinley  ... and modeled himself on  Mark Hanna , the man who virtually manufactured McKinley"",  He concludes, ""This 'degenerate and unlovely age', as one historian calls it, exists in the mind of Karl Rove, the reputed brain of George W. Bush, as the seminal age of inspiration for the politics and governance of America today."" In 2005, Tomlinson commissioned a study of the show, without informing or getting authorization from the CPB board.

Since 2010, Mickey Huff has been the group's director. The project focused on student media literacy and critical thinking skills as applied to the US news media censorship.  Corporate media reporters, editors, and executives lampooned Jensen for claiming they ""censored"" news stories. They argued that the stories were not censored, but that due to time and space constraints they could not publish every story. Jensen began an annual study that found that, rather than covering rather newsworthy stories, the corporate media often featured trivial and non-newsworthy stories, which Jensen termed "" junk food news "" in a 1983 interview published in ''Penthouse''. Dating back to the first ''Censored'' yearbook, published in 1993, each annual ''Censored'' volume has featured a chapter dedicated to exposing what Jensen originally identified as ""junk food news.""  In 1996, when Jensen retired,  Peter Phillips , also a sociology professor at Sonoma State University, became director of Project Censored. He continued to expand the Project's educational outreach and the annual book, adding the concept and analysis of ""News Abuse"" to elaborate Jensen's idea of ""junk food"" news.  Mickey Huff of Diablo Valley College became director in 2010. The first Project Censored yearbook, ''Censored  The News That Didn’t Make the News—And Why'', edited by Carl Jensen, was published by Shelburne Press in 1993.  In addition to being included in the ''Censored'' book series, the organization's annual listing of the most significant but underreported news stories, dating back to 1976, is archived on the Project Censored website.     Documentary films    Project Censored has been the subject of two feature-length documentary films.  In 2013, Doug Hecker and Christopher Oscar produced and directed ''Project Censored  The Movie  Ending the Reign of Junk Food News''.  In 1998, Differential Films released ''Project Censored  Is the Press Really Free?'', directed and produced by Steven Keller. In May 2000, ''Project Censored  Is the Press Really Free?'' aired on  PBS  stations across the United States. It has also been criticized for reporting on stories which are arguably not ""under-reported"" or ""censored"" at all, as they have sometimes appeared in '' The New York Times '' and other high-profile publications. William Powers, writing in '' The New Republic '' called this broad use of the term ""pernicious and deceptive."" In December 2013, Nader selected ''Censored 2014  Fearless Speech in Fateful Times'' as one of his ""10 Books to Provoke Conversation"" in 2014.  In July 2014, Mickey Huff and Andy Lee Roth received the National Whistleblowers Center's Pillar Award for New Media on behalf of Project Censored.

Organized in reaction to the establishment of its  Liberalism liberal  counterpart, the  National Organization for Women ; Because many of the CWA's members were supporters of the  Right to life Right to Life  Movement and strongly opposed these rulings, The CWA lobbies for defunding domestic and international family planning programs, especially those that perform abortions or provide Norplant. As such, the CWA is a supporter of the sanctity of marriage and reproduction, and strongly opposes  divorce . The CWA was a supporter of the  Defense of Marriage Act  The CWA also testified against the Family and Medical Leave Act on the premise that it was biased against those who could not afford to take leave. It is for these reasons that the CWA initially gained recognition as a public policy organization, for it publicly opposed the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings in 1962 and 1963, which banned religious teachings and practices, such as prayers and Bible readings, in public schools. The dispute quickly escalated as a group of likeminded parents joined Frost and filed a federal lawsuit, resulting in the CWA's public support against the school and  People for the American Way , one of its many liberal counterparts. However, they also concede that if it is taught in school, then it needs to be  abstinence-only sex education . As described above, the CWA aided the plaintiff in the 1983 case '' Mozert v. Hawkins Mozert v. Hawkins County School Board '', by arguing it is unconstitutional for public schools to require reading material that conflicts with the religious values of parents. Contrary to ''Mozert v. Hawkins County School Board'', in which the CWA protested against the school's nonsecular teaching, ''Lee v. Weisman'' resulted in support from conservative Christian organizations, such as the CWA, who fought to defend the maintenance of religious practices in public schools, such prayer at graduation.      National sovereignty     The CWA originally opposed the U.S. involvement in the  United Nations , but have since accepted the UN and instead focus on the alleged dangers of conferences and treaties. They view CEDAW as a tool to undermine the traditional family and guarantee global abortion and prostitution.      Sexual exploitation     The CWA sees a problem with men becoming addicted to pornography asserting that it leads to the exploitation and victimization of women . The CWA believes that legalizing prostitution would increase sex trafficking, not decrease it as other organizations have proposed. This relationship is backed by a long history of conservative Christians' support for Israel.

It serves as a national  Radio syndication syndicator  to a network of over 1,000  public radio   List of NPR stations stations  in the United States.    Name   The organization's legal name is ''National Public Radio'' and its  trademark ed brand is ''NPR''; it is known by both names. This act was signed into law by 36th   President of the United States President   Lyndon B. Johnson , and established the  Corporation for Public Broadcasting , which also created the  PBS Public Broadcasting Service  PBS   for television in addition to NPR. A CPB organizing committee under John Witherspoon first created a board of directors chaired by  Bernard Mayes .  The board then hired  Don Quayle Donald Quayle  to be the first president of NPR with 30 employees and 90 charter member local stations, and studios in  Washington, D.C.  In exchange, NPR agreed to a new arrangement whereby the annual CPB stipend that it had previously received directly would be divided among local stations instead; in turn, those stations would support NPR productions on a subscription basis. NPR also agreed to turn its satellite service into a cooperative venture  the  Public Radio Satellite System  , making it possible for non-NPR shows to get national distribution. It took NPR approximately three years to pay off the debt. Lewis resigned in August 1998.  In November 2003, NPR received $235 million from the estate of the late  Joan B. Kroc , the widow of  Ray Kroc , founder of  McDonald's Corporation . This was the largest monetary gift ever to a cultural institution. The endowment fund before the gift totaled $35 million. NPR will use the interest from the bequest to expand its news staff and reduce some member stations' fees. and NPR podcasts like Fresh Air and TED Radio Hour routinely made the  iTunes  Top Podcasts list. The organization indicated this was in response to a rapid drop in corporate  underwriting spot underwriting  in the wake of the  economic crisis of 2008 .  In March 2008, the NPR Board announced that Stern would be stepping down from his role as chief executive officer, following conflict with NPR's board of directors ""over the direction of the organization""  including issues NPR's member station managers had had with NPR's expansion into  new media  ""at the expense of serving"" the stations that financially support NPR . The OSI has made previous donations, but does not take on air credit for its gifts. The new headquarters—at the corner of North Capitol Street NE and L Street NW—is in the burgeoning  NoMa  neighborhood of Washington.  In December 2018,  The Washington Post  reported that between 20 and 22 percent of NPR staff was classified as  Temporary work temps , while this compares to about five percent of a typical for-profit television station. Some of the temporary staff member told the newspaper the systems was ""exploitative"", but NPR's president of operations said the current systems was in place because the station ""media company that strives to be innovative and nimble.""    Governance   NPR is a membership organization. Member stations are required to be  non-commercial  or  non-commercial educational  radio stations; have at least five full-time professional employees; operate for at least 18 hours per day; and not be designed solely to further a  religious broadcasting  philosophy or be used for classroom  distance learning  programming. Each member station receives one vote at the annual NPR board meetings—exercised by its designated Authorized Station Representative  ""A-Rep"" .  To oversee the day-to-day operations and prepare its budget, members elect a board of directors. This board is composed of ten A-Reps, five members of the general public, and the chair of the NPR Foundation. Terms are for three years and are  Staggered board of directors staggered  such that some stand for election every year.  ;NPR member station managers   Mike Crane, director,  Wisconsin Public Radio    Betsy Gardella, president and CEO,  New Hampshire Public Radio    Kit Jensen, chief operating officer  WVIZ/PBS  & 90.3  WCPN  ideastream, chair of the board   Roger LaMay, general manager,  WXPN    Caryn Mathes, president and general manager,  KUOW-FM KUOW    Greg Petrowich, executive director,  WSIU  FM  WSIU Public Broadcasting    Florence Rogers, president and general manager,  Nevada Public Radio    Mike Savage, general manager,  WBAA    Kerry Swanson, station manager,  Northwest Public Radio    Connie Walker, general manager,  WUNC  FM  WUNC   ;President of NPR    Jarl Mohn , president and CEO  ;Chair of the NPR Foundation   Howard Wollner, senior vice president, retired,  Starbucks Coffee Company   ;Public members of the board   Fabiola Arredondo, managing partner, Siempre Holdings   Chris Boskin, media company consultant   Patricia Diaz Dennis, senior vice president and assistant general counsel, retired,  AT&T    Paul G.

Provide extended coverage of public events, issues and ideas, and to acquire and produce special public affairs programs.   Acquire and produce cultural programs which can be scheduled individually by stations.

Establish liaison with foreign broadcasters for a program exchange service.   Produce materials specifically intended to develop the art and technical potential of radio The position reports to the president and CEO  Jarl Mohn . in 2012 10.9% of the revenues for Public Radio came from federal sources.  2013 saw the launch of ''Center Stage'', a mix of  native advertising  and  banner ad  featured prominently on the NPR homepage, above-the-fold. The launch partner for ''Center Stage'' was  Squarespace .     Underwriting spots vs. commercials    In contrast with  commercial broadcasting , NPR's radio broadcasts do not carry traditional commercials, but has advertising in the form of brief statements from major sponsors which may include corporate  Advertising slogan slogans , descriptions of products and services, contact information such as website addresses and  telephone number s.  According to 2009, NPR statistics, about 20.9 million listeners tune into NPR each week.

It is one of the French-speaking province's last two English-language dailies; the other is the '' Sherbrooke Record '', which serves the anglophone community in the Eastern Townships southeast of Montreal.  Founded in 1778 by  Fleury Mesplet , ''The Gazette'' is Quebec's oldest daily newspaper and Canada's oldest daily newspaper still in publication. It was the first entirely French-language newspaper in Canada.  French columns were in the left-hand column and English columns in the right-hand column. The columns were originally written in French and translated to English by Valentin Jautard, who served as editor until his death in 1787. This was among the main events leading to the  Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal burning of the Parliament Buildings . Ferres was subsequently arrested.  In 1968, ''The Gazette'' was acquired by the  Southam Inc. Southam  newspaper chain, which owned major dailies across Canada.  ''The Gazette'' was second in circulation to the ''Montreal Star'', which sold more newspapers in the city and had a significant national reputation in the first half of the 20th century. The ''Montreal Herald'' closed in 1957, after publishing for 146 years.  The ''Montreal Star'', part of the FP Publications chain  which owned the '' Winnipeg Free Press '' and, at the time, '' The Globe and Mail '' , endured a long strike and ceased publication in 1979, less than a year after the strike was settled.  File Gazette reader.jpg thumb left upright A statue in  Westmount, Quebec Westmount  of man reading ''The Gazette''  In 1988, a competing English-language daily, the '' Montreal Daily News '', was launched. The ''Montreal Daily News'' adopted a tabloid format and introduced a Sunday edition, forcing ''The Gazette'' to respond. After the ''Montreal Daily News'' closed in 1989, after less than two years in operation, ''The Gazette'' kept its Sunday edition going until August 2010.  In 1996, the Southam papers were bought by  Conrad Black 's  Hollinger Inc.  Then in August 2000, Hollinger sold the Southam newspapers, including ''The Gazette'', to  Canwest Canwest Global Communications Corp. , controlled by the Winnipeg-based Asper family. In 2010, a new media group,  Postmedia , bought the Gazette and other papers from the financially troubled Canwest.    Today   Today, ''The Gazette''s audience is primarily Quebec's English-speaking community. ''The Gazette'' is one of the four dailies published in Montreal, the other three being French-language newspapers  '' La Presse  Canada  La Presse '', '' Le Journal de Montréal '', and '' Le Devoir '' .  In recent years, ''The Gazette'' has stepped up efforts to reach bilingual francophone professionals and adjusted its coverage accordingly. The current editor-in-chief is Lucinda Chodan and the associate managing editors are James Bassil and Jeff Blond. On May 5, 2014, it was announced that printing of ''The Gazette'' would be contracted out to  Transcontinental Media  in August 2014 and that the existing Notre-Dame-de-Grâce facility would be closed, resulting in a loss of 54 full-time and 61 part-time positions at the paper.

It was co-founded in 2006 by  Jon Soltz  and Jeremy Broussard.  Initially composed of United States  Iraq  and  Afghanistan  war  veterans , the organization views defense policy as an American priority. The stated goal of the PAC is to put in Congress Afghanistan or Iraq war veterans who are critical of the execution of the  Iraq War war in Iraq .  According to the VoteVets.org, the goal of the 501 c  4  is to educate the American public on the war and military issues, and hold politicians accountable. In February 2007, a VoteVets.org spokesman told '' The Washington Post '' that the group had 20,000 members, including 1,000 veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan'. In a June 2011 press release, the organization specifically identified itself as the ""largest  Progressivism in the United States progressive  group of veterans in America.""   VoteVets claim was based, in part, on the  Republican Party  United States  Republican  senators' vote against an amendment offered   The group  FactCheck.org   a self-described non-partisan project of the  Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania Annenberg Center  at the  University of Pennsylvania   stated that the ad was misleading because the 2003 Senate budget amendment  on which the criticism was based  made no specific reference to ""body armor"".   The group also endorsed the candidates who it endorsed in 2006 and reached Congress, Democratic Representatives  Patrick Murphy  Pennsylvania politician  Patrick Murphy ,  Joe Sestak ,  Tim Walz , and  Chris Carney . Overall, VoteVets PAC contributed nearly $500,000 to candidates and other PACs during the 2008 election cycle. The exposing of the email caused Senator  Barack Obama  to call for hearings, and for Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee in the Senate, Senator  Daniel Akaka , to hold such hearings. with an attached petition, which received 30,000 signatures, according to the group. It also aired television ads, targeting Senator  John McCain      Close Gitmo Now campaign    In January 2010,  dozens of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans from VoteVets.org traveled to  Washington, D.C.  to join with the Campaign to Close Guantanamo in lobbying the  United States Congress  to close the prison at  Guantanamo Bay . The veterans delivered a letter to a number of Congressmen and Senators, co-signed by about 2000 veterans, calling for Congress to follow President  Barack Obama 's lead, and move to shut down the facility that they felt had become a blight on America's reputation.  The 30-second ads were directed at Senators  Mitch McConnell , the minority leader from  Kentucky ,  Evan Bayh , Democrat of  Indiana ,  John Thune , Republican of  South Dakota ,  John Barrasso , Republican of  Wyoming ,  Richard Lugar , Republican of Indiana,  Charles Grassley , Republican of  Iowa , and Representative  Mark Kirk , Republican of  Illinois .   United States Senate Senator   John Kerry , the sponsor of the bi-partisan clean energy bill on the Senate, endorsed the ad on the same day.     Clean energy poll     In April 2010, VoteVets conducted a poll of  Iraq  and  Afghanistan  veterans regarding their positions on clean energy. The poll found that 73 percent of them supported Clean Energy Climate Change legislation in the  United States Congress , 79 percent believed ending our dependence on foreign oil was important to national security, and 67 percent supported the argument that such legislation will help their own economic prospects.  The poll was conducted by Lake Research Group for VoteVets.org In February, and is made up of 45 percent self-identified  Republican Party  United States  Republicans , 25 percent Independents, and 20 percent  Democratic Party  United States  Democrats .     Summer ad campaign     In June 2010, VoteVets partnered with the  League of Conservation Voters ,  Service Employees International Union , and  Sierra Club  and announced an $11 million campaign to help ensure that the U.S. Senate takes decisive action on comprehensive energy and climate legislation that summer. This unprecedented effort is one of the largest coordinated efforts to date to educate the public on where key Senators stand on the historic fight to put America back in control of its energy future with legislation that creates new clean energy jobs, reduces our dangerous addiction to oil and curbs harmful carbon pollution.  As part of the campaign, VoteVets ran ads criticizing Senators  Richard Burr   R-NC ,  Mike Johanns   R-NE , and  Ben Nelson   D-NE  for opposing clean energy climate legislation.  The coalition also ran ads supporting Senators  Claire McCaskill   D-MO  and  Harry Reid   D-NV  for their support of the legislation.     SGLI petition     In August 2010, VoteVets helped expose an alleged scam perpetrated by banks in the disbursement of  Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance   SGLI  funds to gold star  service flag  families. According to VoteVets,  Prudential Financial  and  MetLife  had been investing life insurance benefits for service members killed and Iraq and Afghanistan and not turning the accrued interest over to the families of the deceased. VoteVets launched a petition asking Congress to hold hearings on the issue.  ""Harry Reid has always been there for us,"" said  Jon Soltz ,  Iraq War  veteran and Chairman of VoteVets.org.  ""This ad truly encapsulates how we feel about him and the dogged leadership he's provided, especially when it comes to veterans.  In very many ways, veterans coming home face the same kind of challenges that Harry Reid has always conquered - getting an education, working our way up the ladder.  So not only are we thankful for his leadership, and respect it, but we identify with his character.  That's why we've chosen to run an ad like this."". VoteVets also spent $200,000 in Virginia to run ads criticizing Republican House candidate  Robert Hurt  Virginia politician  Robert Hurt  for his lack of support for unemployment benefit extension which the group claimed disproportionately affected Veterans.  On December 12, 2011, Soltz returned as chairman after completing his deployment.  The blog is edited by  War in Afghanistan  2001–present  Afghanistan War  veteran Richard Allen Smith.   As part of a $500,000 campaign, variations of the video were shown in a number of congressional districts and also included two other retired generals   Paul D. Eaton  and  Wesley K. Clark .

The newspaper has a generally  centrist  audience. ''USA Today'' shares the position of having the widest  List of newspapers in the United States by circulation circulation of any newspaper in the United States  with '' The Wall Street Journal '' and '' The New York Times ''. On June 11, 1981, Gannett printed the first prototypes of the proposed publication. The  two proposed design layouts were mailed to newsmakers and prominent leaders in journalism, for review and feedback. Although ''USA Today'' had been profitable for just ten years as of 1997, it changed the appearance and feel of newspapers around the world.     Newsroom restructuring and 2011 graphical tweaks    On August 27, 2010, ''USA Today'' announced that it would undergo a reorganization of its newsroom, announcing the layoffs of 130 staffers. It also announced that the paper would shift its focus away from print and place more emphasis on its digital platforms  including USAToday.com and its related  mobile app lications  and launch of a new publication called ''USA Today Sports''.  On January 24, 2011, to reverse a revenue slide, the paper introduced a tweaked format that modified the appearance of its front section pages, which included a larger logo at the top of each page; coloring tweaks to section front pages; a new  sans-serif  font, called Prelo, for certain headlines of main stories  replacing the Gulliver typeface that had been implemented for story headers in April 2000 ; an updated ""Newsline"" feature featuring larger, ""newsier"" headline entry points; and the increasing and decreasing of  Masthead  publishing  mastheads  and white space to present a cleaner style. Developed in conjunction with brand design firm  Wolff Olins , the print edition of ''USA Today'' added a page covering technology stories and expanded travel coverage within the Life section and increased the number of color pages included in each edition, while retaining longtime elements. On September 3, 2014, ''USA Today'' announced that it would lay off roughly 70 employees in a restructuring of its newsroom and business operations. Orange is used for bonus sections  section E or above , which are published occasionally such as for  business travel  trends and the  Olympic Games Olympics ; other bonus sections for sports  such as for the  PGA Tour  preview,  NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship NCAA Basketball Tournaments ,  Memorial Day  auto races   Indianapolis 500  and  Coca-Cola 600  ,  National Football League NFL  opening weekend and the  Super Bowl   previously used the orange color, but now use the red designated for sports in their bonus sections. To increase their ties to ''USA Today'', Gannett incorporated the ''USA Today'' coloring scheme into an internally created graphics package for news programming that the company began phasing in across its television station group – which were spun-off in July 2015 into the separate broadcast and digital media company  Tegna, Inc. Tegna  – in late 2012  the package utilizes the color scheme for a rundown graphic used on most stations – outside those that Gannett acquired in 2014 from London Broadcasting, which began implementing the package in late 2015 – that persists throughout its stations' newscasts, as well as bumpers for individual story topics . Gannett's television stations began to a new on-air appearance that uses a color-coding system identical to that of the paper. , sometimes using sentence-length blurbs to describe stories inside; the lead reefer is the cover page feature ""Newsline,"" which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured in all four main sections and any special sections. As a national newspaper, ''USA Today'' cannot focus on the weather for any one city. Therefore, the entire back page of the News section is used for weather maps for the  continental United States ,  Puerto Rico  and the  United States Virgin Islands , and temperature lists for many cities throughout the U.S. and the world  temperatures for individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are suffixed with a one- or two-letter code, such as ""t"" for  thunderstorm s, referencing the expected weather conditions ; the colorized forecast map, originally created by staff designer George Rorick  who left ''USA Today'' for a similar position at '' The Detroit News '' in 1986 , was copied by newspapers around the world, breaking from the traditional style of using monochrome contouring or simplistic text to denote temperature ranges.  Also, in most of the sections' front pages, on the lower left hand corner, are ""USA Today Snapshots"", which give statistics of various lifestyle interests according to the section it is in  for example, a snapshot in ""Life"" could show how many people tend to watch a certain genre of television show based upon the type of mood they are in at the time . These ""Snapshots"" are shown through graphs which are made up of various illustrations of objects that roughly pertain to the graphs subject matter  using the example above, the graph's bars could be made up of several TV sets, or ended by one . These are usually loosely based on research by a national institute  with the credited source mentioned in fine print in the box below the graph .  The newspaper also features an occasional magazine supplement called ''Open Air'', which launched on March 7, 2008 and appears several times a year.

In November 2008, the organization announced that it was eliminating 202 jobs, representing 18 percent of its workforce. The organization also cut its budget from $160&nbsp;million in fiscal 2008 to $138&nbsp;million for fiscal 2009. He left Focus on the Family in early 2010, and subsequently founded Family Talk as a non-profit organization and launched a new broadcast that began airing nationally on May 3, 2010.  He is no longer affiliated with Focus on the Family.  On June 23, 2017,  Vice President of the United States Vice President   Mike Pence  attended the organization's 40th anniversary celebration; at the event, he praised founder James Dobson, stated that  President of the United States President   Donald Trump  is an ally of the organization, and added that the Trump administration supports its goals  including the abolition of  Planned Parenthood  .    Ministries       Marriage and family    Focus on the Family sees its primary ministry as helping couples ""build healthy marriages that reflect God's design"", based on what it sees as ""morals and values grounded in biblical principles.""     Love Won Out     Focus on the Family formed  Love Won Out , an  ex-gay  ministry, in 1998 and in 2009, it was sold to  Exodus International . In June 2013, however, Exodus ceased activities, and it issued a statement which repudiated its aims and apologized for the harm their pursuit caused to  LGBT  people; see .

The website of the NDP Task Force states that ""its business affairs are separate"" from those of Focus on the Family, but also that ""between 1990 and 1993, Focus on the Family did provide grants in support of the NDP Task Force"" and that ""Focus on the Family is compensated for services rendered."" Focus on the Family's magazine ''Citizen'' is exclusively devoted to cultural and public policy issues. FOTF also has an affiliated group, Family Policy Alliance, though the two groups are legally separate. As a  501 c  4   social welfare group, Family Policy Alliance has fewer political lobbying restrictions. FOTF's revenue in 2012 was USD $90.5&nbsp;million, and that of Family Policy Alliance  formerly CitizenLink  was USD $8&nbsp;million. It strongly opposes  LGBT rights , abortion, pornography, gambling, and pre-marital and extramarital sexual activity.

Opposition to same-sex marriage    Focus on the Family works to preserve its interpretation of Biblical ideals of marriage and parenthood, taking a strong stance against LGBT rights, including same-sex marriage. Dobson expressed great concern for the institution of marriage in a 2003 letter to the Christian community. In reference to the same-sex marriage movement, Dobson says that the institution of marriage, ""is about to descend into a state of turmoil unlike any other in human history."" Focus on the Family believes that marriage should be defined as only being between a man and a woman. Dobson supported the failed  Federal Marriage Amendment , which would have defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman, preventing courts and state legislatures from challenging this definition.  In an interview with  Christianity Today ''Christianity Today'' magazine , Dobson also explained that he was not in favor of  civil unions . He stated that civil unions are just same-sex marriage under a different name. The main priority of the opposing same-sex marriage movement is to define marriage on the federal level as between a man and a woman and combat the passage of civil unions later. described Focus on the Family as one of a ""dozen major groups [which] help drive the religious right's anti-gay crusade"". but was subsequently struck down as being unconstitutional by a federal court in '' Perry v.

In an article entitled ""Why America Needs an Immigration Time-Out"", explains it  ""would ease the pressure on the environment and give us a chance to repair our institutions."" Its Board of Advisors has included individuals such as former Congressman  Brian Bilbray   R-CA  and former Governor  Richard Lamm   D-CO . The group promotes policies to improve border security and stop  illegal immigration , and to reduce legal immigration into the United States to around 300,000 people a year. FAIR's policy studies emphasize the environmental, economic, and social effects of mass immigration. FAIR's President Dan Stein serves on the 61-member board of the  Citizens' Debate Commission , a nonpartisan American organization formed in 2004, which was established to sponsor future general election presidential debates.  FAIR is a member of the  Coalition for the Future American Worker , which describes itself as ""an umbrella organization of professional trade groups, population/environment organizations, and  immigration reform  groups. CFAW was formed to represent the interests of American workers and students in the formulation of immigration policy.""    History   The ""founder of the modern immigration reform movement""—John Tanton—an ophthalmologist in  Petoskey, Michigan —""saw a threat coming in the soaring rates of immigration"" and that the ""environment was threatened by overpopulation"".  Dan Stein  attorney  Dan Stein  has been president of FAIR since 1988.  In ''American Immigration  An Encyclopedia of Political, Social, and Cultural Change'', Brian N. Fry described Tanton as the ""leader of the drive to restrict immigration"" starting in the mid-1970s. Fry described those who favored maintaining or increasing immigration numbers as ""expansionists"" and those who sought to reduce them as """"restrictionists."" Fry traced ""restrictions roots"" to a surprising surge in illegal and legal immigration—the ""new immigration""—following the 1964 termination of the  Bracero Program  and the enactment of the  Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 . It was in this context that Tanton as President of Zero Population Growth from 1975–77 attempted to get members to ""support immigration restrictions."" When they were unwilling, he launched FAIR with seed money in 1979. and the  Pioneer Fund  which contributed $1.2 million to FAIR in the 1980s and early 1990s. FAIR stopped ""receiving grants"" from Pioneer that required ""public disclosure."" The SPLC claimed FAIR continued to ""receive private financial support from Pioneer's leaders for several years."" and Tanton, U.S. English became a well-organized and well-funded official movement resulting in a twenty-two states enacting official language laws to protect English between 1981–97. and Tanton was perceived as the leader. As a result, liberal groups who opposed FAIR focused on Tanton who was at that time ""in his 32nd year on the board."" Tanton was concerned that US birthrates had dropped ""below replacement level. annual event of ""like-minded talk radio hosts"" At the ninth annual ""radio row"" on June 22 and 23, 2016 fifty talk show hosts from all over the United States broadcast their shows and debated immigration policy.""

United States Senate Senators  who had previously ""embraced the framework"" were convinced by Senate Republican Leader  Mitch McConnell  that they were being politically unwise. Their rhetoric turned ""shrill"" and ""anti-reform"" with one Senator talking about ""death panels that would kill grandma."" In 2014 in a FAIR press release, they strongly challenged Holder's lawsuits against Arizona, South Carolina and Alabama, states that opposed sanctuary cities' protecting illegal immigrants. Stein warned that the United States was at ""the verge of 'civil violence' thanks to ""Holder and immigration reform advocates"". Kaufman shared Stein's concerns that President Obama had ""done nothing but destroy everything my country represented."" As of the end 2016, FAIR's annual budget reached $11.2 million.  A 2017 FAIR report claimed that undocumented immigrants in the United States cost taxpayers approximately $134.9 billion. This report included the children of undocumented immigrants, even those who were U.S. citizens, in the cost calculation. According to the  Associated Press , ""the estimate was criticized for making broad generalizations and other major methodological flaws.""

Judicial Watch was involved in a similar legal dispute with Vice President Dick Cheney in 2002 when the group filed a shareholder lawsuit against  Halliburton . The lawsuit, which accused Halliburton of accounting fraud, alleged that ""when Mr. Cheney was chief executive of Halliburton, he and other directors inflated revenue reports, boosting Halliburton's share price.""  A federal judge ruled on February 23, 2016 that top aides to Hillary Clinton could be questioned under oath by Judicial Watch about her use of a private email server as secretary of state. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted Judicial Watch's motion for discovery into whether the State Department and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deliberately thwarted the Freedom of Information Act by using a private email server to obscure her communications from public records requests.     Commerce Department trade mission scandal      In 1995, Judicial Watch, Inc. filed an action in the District Court under the FOIA, seeking information from the  Department of Commerce   DOC  regarding DOC's selection of participants for foreign trade missions. In May 1995, following a search in response to Judicial Watch's FOIA requests, DOC produced approximately 28,000 pages of nonexempt information and withheld about 1,000 documents as exempt. Disputes arose between the parties over the adequacy of DOC's search, and Judicial Watch charged that some DOC officials had destroyed or removed responsive documents. In December 1998, following discovery, the District Court granted partial summary judgment to Judicial Watch and ordered DOC to perform a new search. The  United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  partially affirmed the decision, holding that the Secret Service did not have to produce records of visitors to the president's office. Judicial Watch also made false claims about Pelosi's air travel in 2008 as well. On May 2, 2011 Judicial Watch filed a FOIA request with the  United States Department of Defense Department of Defense  and the CIA for photographs and videos of bin Laden taken during or after the operation.     Kennedy assassination records     Judicial Watch filed a FOIA lawsuit against the  National Archives and Records Administration   NARA  to obtain the records from  Robert F. Kennedy 's tenure as the U.S. Attorney General. The records covered sensitive intelligence operations conducted during the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson administrations.  In a separate case, on March 29, 2016 U.S. District Court Judge  Royce Lamberth  granted Judicial Watch limited discovery, citing potential bad faith by the government in responding to requests for documents related to talking points provided to Susan Rice in response to the Benghazi attack.     False claims about George Zimmermann protests     In 2013, Judicial Watch claimed that the Department of Justice under the Obama administration organized protests against George Zimmermann after the Trayvon Martin shooting; ''PolitiFact'' said that this ""mostly false"" and that while Justice Department employees were sent to Florida, they ""were sent with the idea of keeping the situation peaceful and calm, not to instigate or condone protests or violence."" Judicial Watch paid Bannon's group Victory Film Project $382,143 for the film. Judicial Watch's president Tom Fitton said ""Liberal activists want to destroy Breitbart, but we won’t be cowed"".     False voter fraud claims     In August 2017, Judicial Watch falsely alleged that 11 California counties had more registered voters than their estimated populations of citizens eligible to vote; the claims were picked up by outlets such as  Breitbart News  and Russian propaganda network  RT  TV network  RT  Russia Today  .     False claims about Trump Nazi billboard     In 2017, Judicial Watch falsely claimed that taxpayer money went into a billboard which depicted President Donald Trump as a Nazi;  The Arizona Republic  noted that this was false. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton has called for the Special Counsel investigation to be shut down, arguing that prosecutors in the probe were too biased against President Trump to conduct a credible investigation, a claim rejected by Republican Senators  Tom Tillis  and  Bob Corker . After the release of the documents, Fitton said that they seemed to ""confirm the FBI and DoJ misled the courts in withholding info about Clinton-DNC being behind the info used to get the FISA warrant."" ''The Washington Post'' fact-checked the claim a year earlier and found that it was ""lacking any evidence"". Judicial Watch linked to the court filing, but did not mention that the DOJ said this was ""typical in proceedings before the FISC."" Judicial Watch had been engaged in what NPR described as a ""full-throated campaign against Soros"". Among other things, Judicial Watch raised money by running ads with a call to action  ""Expose Soros!"" Judicial Watch said the statue ""needs to go"" because ""Pancho Villa did great harm to people."" In 2006 Klayman sued Judicial Watch and its president  Tom Fitton . The lawsuit charged Fitton with misrepresentation of his academic and professional credentials upon hiring, and upon assuming his position engaged in false and misleading fund raising, misuse of donor money, failure to appoint an attorney as Chairman, failure to comply with a promised  severance package  to Klayman, and other actions which damaged Judicial Watch, the donors and Klayman.   On October 14, 2009, the Court found that Klayman breached the severance agreement by failing to pay Judicial Watch, around $69,000 in un-reimbursed personal expenses.  In 2014, Klayman agreed to be publicly censured by the  District of Columbia Bar D.C. Bar . Klayman represented three individuals who had sued Judicial Watch, his former employer and client, but he failed to obtain Judicial Watch's consent to waive his conflict of interest.  Klayman maintained that the bar ""recognized there was no evidence of dishonesty or personal gain"".    Peter Paul lawsuit    In 2007 former donor  Peter F. Paul  sued Judicial Watch, accusing it of using his name to raise more than $15 million to support his lawsuit against  Bill Clinton  and  Hillary Clinton  while doing little to advance his case. Between 1997 and 2002 Judicial Watch received $7,069,500 in 19 grants from a handful of foundations. The bulk of this funding came from three foundations  the  Sarah Scaife Foundation , a funder of  conservatism in the United States politically conservative  causes;    Notes       Further reading      Fitton, Tom ''The Corruption Chronicles  Obama's Big Secrecy, Big Corruption, and Big Government''  New York  Simon & Schuster, 2012 .

Audrey Cooper  was named editor-in-chief in January 2015 and is the first woman to hold the position.  The editorial page editor is John Diaz.

Fainaru-Wada and Williams were recognized for their work on uncovering the  BALCO  scandal, which linked  San Francisco Giants  star  Barry Bonds  to performance-enhancing drugs. While the two above-named reporters broke the news, they are by no means the only sports writers of note at the ''Chronicle''. The ''Chronicle''s sports section, edited by Al Saracevic and called ''Sporting Green'' as it is printed on green-tinted pages, is staffed by a dozen writers. The section's best-known writers are its columnists  Bruce Jenkins, Ann Killion, Scott Ostler, Saracevic and Tom Stienstra. Its baseball coverage is anchored by Henry Schulman, John Shea and  Susan Slusser , the first female president of the  Baseball Writers' Association of America   BBWAA .  Another area of note is the architecture column by John King; the Chronicle is still one of the few American papers to present a regular column on architectural issues. The paper also has regular weekly sections devoted to Food & Home and Style.    Challenges   Circulation has fallen sharply since the heyday of the  dot-com bubble dot-com boom  from 1997 to 2001.

Lish is noted for encouraging Carver's  minimalism  and publishing the short stories of  Richard Ford . Using the influential publication as a vehicle to introduce new fiction by emerging authors, he promoted the work of such writers as  T. Coraghessan Boyle ,  Barry Hannah ,  Cynthia Ozick  and  Reynolds Price .  In February 1977, ''Esquire'' published ""For Rupert – with no promises"" as an unsigned work of fiction  this was the first time it had published a work without identifying the author. Readers speculated that it was the work of  J. D. Salinger , the reclusive author best known for '' The Catcher in the Rye ''. Told in first-person, the story features events and Glass family names from the story "" For Esmé – with Love and Squalor "".  Gordon Lish  is quoted as saying, ""I tried to borrow Salinger's voice and the psychological circumstances of his life, as I imagine them to be now. And I tried to use those things to elaborate on certain circumstances and events in his fiction to deepen them and add complexity.""    The Napkin Fiction Project   In 2007 ''Esquire'' launched the Napkin Fiction Project, in which 250 cocktail napkins were mailed to writers all over the country by the incoming fiction editor, in a playful attempt to revive short fiction—""some with a half dozen books to their name, others just finishing their first."" However, after a nine-year hiatus, the feature was revived in the January 2017 issue with a skewering of 2016 events.    Sexiest Woman Alive     The annual feature '''Sexiest Woman Alive''' designation by the magazine is billed as a benchmark of female attractiveness.  Originally, it was a part of the ""Women We Love"" issue that was released in November. To build interest, the magazine would do a tease, releasing partial images of the woman in the issues preceding the November issue. By 2007, it had become the dominating story of the issue and to create an element of surprise the hints were abandoned.  { class ""wikitable sortable""  -   Year   Choice   Age  -   2004   Angelina Jolie    23  -   2006   Scarlett Johansson    32  -   2008   Halle Berry    29  -   2013   Scarlett Johansson   40  -   2015   Emilia Clarke   ; 2011   In March, ''Esquire'' won a National Magazine Award for Digital Media—the first Mobile Edition prize—from the American Society of Magazine Editors.

It has editorial and sales offices in  Toronto , Ontario, Canada;  New Internationalist Australia Adelaide, Australia ; and  Christchurch , New Zealand.  New Internationalist has produced films, books and other materials for various United Nations and related bodies concerned with world development. Its forerunner was ''The Internationalist'', sent to members of the student development organisation  Third World First , since renamed  People & Planet .  It was set up with financial help from two UK NGOs,  Oxfam  and  Christian Aid , who wanted to encourage more people to understand the processes of ""development"" by publishing a monthly magazine to discuss and debate development issues in an accessible way. and Bishop  Helder Camara  in Brazil, and features on Vietnam, drought in the  Sahel , and the legacy of  Che Guevara . It was an issue of ''New Internationalist'' magazine, in August 1973, that first drew attention to the irresponsible marketing of  baby milk  in the Third World by multinational companies. It aimed to offer readers ""a radical analysis of rich-poor world relationships, looking critically at the effects of aid programmes, for example, and providing a refreshing alternative to the mainstream development and news channels, and  mainstream media "". The transfer of ownership from the Adamsons came about with the creation of Advisory Trustees and Employee Trustees, with the limited company being owned by New Internationalist Trust. The Co-op's legal status was achieved in June 1992.     Recent history      ''New Internationalist'' magazine has a circulation of 75,000 and offices in  New Internationalist Australia Australia , New Zealand and Canada, in addition to the UK operation.  Starting in September 2018, the magazine is published bimonthly, six times a year, with its size doubled to 84 pages.  In addition to publishing the magazine, since 1982 the NI team has produced its own full-colour One World Calendar in collaboration with a consortium of European aid agencies. Other one-off projects have included  a Peace Pack, a resource kit for anti-nuclear-weapons campaigners; a book to mark the end of the UN Decade for Women in 1985 and a television film for the UK's  Channel 4  about women and food production in Africa  ''Man-Made Famine'' . This film provided the basis for a project to assess the use of video as a teaching device with rural women in  Kenya . In 1987 they made another film, ''Girls Apart'', which contrasted the lives of a black and a white girl in South Africa. This film was shown in Britain on  BBC2 .  However, the group felt it did not have the resources to make film a central part of its activities. As a result, they looked to concentrating on areas of work that could be incorporated more readily into their existing operations – design and print.  The main initiative, begun early in 1988, was to extend the range of items sold by the ''NI'' to include a One World Almanac, T-shirts, mugs and other goods. These made a useful contribution to the ''NI''′s income which was ploughed back into the magazine – for example by introducing colour throughout the magazine in 1993 and switching to fully recycled paper in 1999.  In 1990, the range of products included the group's second major publication, ''The Food Book'', which brought together recipes from around the world. There have been a further three books in this series. The ''NI'' now regularly publishes two–four titles a year, including many No-Nonsense Guides.    See also     P. J.

A trial court granted CU's motion for  summary judgment , and the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit  affirmed the favorable judgment.  ''CR'' stated in a letter from its president Jim Guest to its subscribers that it would retest the seats.

PRI offers over 280 hours of programming each week to stations and listeners. ratings, 8.1 million people listened to PRI programming each week.

In January 2008, PRI and WNYC announced that the name of their new morning drive news program is '' The Takeaway '' with  John Hockenberry  and  Adaora Udoji . This program's editorial partners include The BBC World Service, ''The New York Times'', and WGBH Radio Boston.

In 2017  PRI launches its Engagement Lab    Public radio, PRI, NPR    Public radio  is a generic term for non-commercial radio stations or programming that are covered under the Public Broadcasting Act. Public radio organizations receive funding from corporate sponsors, public  e.g.,  Corporation for Public Broadcasting   and private foundation grants as well as donations and gifts from individuals. The mix of revenue differs by station, network and/or producer. PRI, NPR and American Public Media are the largest providers of public radio programming in the United States. They compete with each other for slots on public radio stations and the attention of listeners. Each has distinct missions and emphases in programming—PRI is focused on global journalism, providing diverse voices, and arts and cultural perspectives. Any given public radio station may be simultaneously both an NPR member and an affiliate of PRI and APM. PRI is a not-for-profit organization that has an independent governing board with an independent board of directors. NPR is a membership organization; its board is composed of public radio stations which run for seats on the board.  PRI is a younger organization than NPR, and focuses on pushing the sound of public radio forward through innovative programming strategies and leading media in its areas of focus—global news and cultural perspectives.  NPR was founded in 1970 and PRI in 1983.  Many PRI shows draw a younger overall audience than shows produced by NPR. PRI's stated purpose is to offer a wider range of voices than NPR programs. APM was formed by Minnesota Public Radio to distribute programs it owned and produced, thereby moving distribution from PRI to APM.  In addition, PRI distributed '' World Cafe '' for many years, but in 2005, the show's distribution was switched to NPR. At the same time, PRI has also picked up the distribution of programs originally distributed by  NPR , including '' Michael Feldman's Whad'Ya Know? '', and, in 2006, '' Living on Earth ''— public radio 's leading news and information program focused on the environment. In September 2007, PRI became the national distributor of '' Selected Shorts '' which was previously distributed by NPR. In January 2014, PRI became the national distributor of '' Science Friday '', also previously distributed by NPR.

Cato has stated on its ""About Cato"" page  ""The Jeffersonian philosophy that animates Cato's work has increasingly come to be called 'libertarianism' or 'market liberalism.' It combines an appreciation for entrepreneurship, the market process, and lower taxes with strict respect for civil liberties and skepticism about the benefits of both the welfare state and foreign military adventurism.""

He is a former ARI board member and is reported to be an ""ardent devotee"" of Rand who has promoted reading her books to colleges nationwide. and  Eric Lichtblau  called Cato ""one of the country's most widely cited research organizations.""     On domestic issues    Cato scholars have consistently called for the privatization of many government services and institutions, including  NASA ,  Social Security  United States  Social Security , the  United States Postal Service , the  Transportation Security Administration ,  public schooling ,  public transportation  systems, and  public broadcasting . In 2004, Cato scholar Daniel Griswold wrote in support of President George W. Bush's failed proposal to grant temporary work visas to otherwise undocumented laborers which would have granted limited residency for the purpose of employment in the U.S.  In 2003, Cato filed an  Amicus curiae amicus brief  in support of the Supreme Court's decision in '' Lawrence v. Texas '', which struck down the remaining state laws that made private, non-commercial homosexual relations between consenting adults illegal. Cato cited the  Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution 14th Amendment , among other things, as the source of their support for the ruling. The amicus brief was cited in Justice Kennedy's majority opinion for the Court. The amendment would have changed the United States Constitution to prohibit  same-sex marriage ; the amendment failed in both houses of Congress.  Cato scholars have been sharp critics of current U.S. drug policy and the perceived growing militarization of U.S. law enforcement. Cato has published numerous studies criticizing what it calls ""corporate welfare"", the practice of public officials funneling taxpayer money, usually via targeted budgetary spending, to politically connected corporate interests. Again in 2005, Cato scholar Jerry Taylor teamed up with Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club to attack the Republican  Energy Policy Act of 2005 Energy Bill  as a give-away to corporate interests.     On foreign policy    Cato's  Non-interventionism non-interventionist  foreign policy views, and strong support for civil liberties, have frequently led Cato scholars to criticize those in power, both Republican and Democratic. Cato scholars opposed President  George H. W. Bush 's 1991  Gulf War  operations  a position which caused the organization to lose nearly $1 million in funding , Carpenter also predicted  ""Most notably there is the issue posed by two persistent regional secession movements  the Kurds in the north and the Shiites in the south.""     On environmental policy    Cato scholars have written about the issues of the environment, including global warming, environmental regulation, and energy policy.   PolitiFact.com  and '' Scientific American '' have criticized Cato's work on global warming. They also spoke out against the former president's calls for larger ethanol subsidies.     Other commentaries of presidential administrations     Cato scholars were critical of  George W.

It is owned by the Gannett Company, Inc. The Journal News was created through a merger of several daily community newspapers serving the three counties. Although the current newspaper's name comes from the Rockland Journal-News, which was based in West Nyack, N.Y., and served Rockland County, the Rockland Journal-News was actually the third-largest newspaper that Gannett merged to create the larger newspaper. The Reporter Dispatch from White Plains, N.Y., and the Herald Statesman in Yonkers, N.Y. were larger and served Westchester County.  For years prior to the October 12, 1998, merger that created The Journal News, ten of the newspapers shared substantial content and printing presses.Gannett acquired nine of the newspapers in 1964 from the Macy family and added The Star in Peekskill, N.Y., in 1985. These newspapers previously appeared on newsstands in the evening. In 1989, Gannett created a morning edition for Putnam County, Westchester, and the Bronx called The Sunrise, but it folded after a year.

The Abell family and descendents owned ''The Sun''  later after 1910 colloquially known in Baltimore as ''The Sunpapers''  for the senior morning paper and the added afternoon daily ''The Evening Sun''  until that same year of 1910, when the local Black and Garrett families of wealthy financial means invested funds in the paper under the suggestion of former rival owner/publisher of  Baltimore News-American ''The News'' ,  Charles H. Grasty , and they, along with Grasty gained a  controlling interest ; they retained  the name A. S. Abell Company for the parent publishing company. That same year, an additional daily publication was established called ''The Evening Sun'' under the guidance of former reporter, editor/columnist  H.L. Mencken Henry Louis Mencken  nationally famous as ""H.L. Mencken""    1880-1956 , From 1947 to 1986, ''The Sun'' was the owner of Maryland's first  television  station,  WMAR-TV   Channel 2 , founded 1947 and longtime affiliate of the  Columbia Broadcasting System    CBS  television network, along with several radio stations.  In the postwar years, ''The Sun'' significantly expanded its overseas presence. The newspaper opened its first foreign bureau in  London  in 1924. Between 1955 and 1961, it added four new foreign offices. As  Cold War  tensions grew, it set up shop in  Bonn, Germany Bonn, West Germany , in February 1955.  The bureau later moved to  Berlin .  Eleven months later, ''The Sun'' opened a  Moscow  bureau, becoming one of the first U.S. newspapers to do so. A  Rome  office followed in July 1957, and in 1961, The Sun expanded to  New Delhi . A decade later in 1997, ''The Sun'' acquired the  The Howard County Times Patuxent Publishing Company , a local suburban newspaper publisher that had a stable of 15 weekly papers and a few magazines in several communities and counties. All were closed by 2008, as the Tribune Co. streamlined and downsized the newspaper chain's foreign reporting. Some material from ''The Sun's'' foreign correspondents is archived at the  University of Maryland, Baltimore County . and competition in 2005 from a new free daily, '' The Baltimore Examiner '' that lasted two years to 2007, along with a similar Washington publication of a small chain recently started by new owners that took over the old Hearst flagship paper, the '' San Francisco Examiner ''. Its circulation  was 195,561 for the daily edition and 343,552 on Sundays. On April 29, 2009, the  Tribune Company  announced that it would lay off 61 of the 205 staff members in the ''Sun'' newsroom. On September 23, 2011, it was reported  On February 20, 2014, The Baltimore Sun Media Group announced that they would buy the alternative weekly  Baltimore City Paper ''City Paper'' . However, by the 1980s, cultural, technological and economic shifts in America were eating away at afternoon newspapers' market share, with readers flocking to either morning papers or switching to nightly television news broadcasts. Features sections debuting in 2010 included a Saturday ""Home"" section, a Thursday ""Style"" section and a Monday section called ""Sunrise."" The sports article written by  Peter Schmuck  is published only on week-days.     Sunday    The ''Sunday Sun'' for many years was noted for a locally produced  rotogravure  Maryland pictorial magazine section, featuring works by such acclaimed photographers as  A. Aubrey Bodine . The ''Sunday Sun'' dropped the Sunday ''Sun Magazine'' in 1996 and now only carries '' Parade  magazine  Parade '' magazine on a weekly basis. A quarterly version of the ''Sun Magazine'' The paper transitioned from daily to weekly publication in 2011. It ceased publication entirely in August 2015, more than a year after the Baltimore Sun Media Group acquired ''City Paper.'' ''The Sun''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s printing facility at Sun Park has highly sophisticated computerized presses and automated insertion equipment in the packaging area. To keep pace with the speed of the presses and Automated Guided Vehicles; ""intelligent"" electronic forklifts deliver the newsprint to the presses.  In 1885, ''The Sun'' constructed a  Sun Building building for its Washington Bureau  at 1317 F Street, NW.   The same Olesker was forced to resign on January 4, 2006, after being accused of  plagiarism .  The '' Baltimore City Paper '' reported that several of his columns contained sentences or paragraphs that were extremely similar  although not identical  to material previously published in '' The Washington Post '', '' The New York Times '', and ''The Sun''. In June 2011, all 10 original charges were dropped, in what was widely viewed as an acknowledgement that the government had no valid case against the whistleblower, who eventually pleaded to one misdemeanor count for exceeding authorized use of a computer. Drake was the 2011 recipient of the  The Ridenhour Prizes Ridenhour Prize for Truth-Telling .    In popular culture   ''The Baltimore Sun'' is featured in  The Wire  season 5  season 5  of '' The Wire '', which was created by former ''Sun'' reporter  David Simon .  Like all of the institutions featured in ''The Wire'', the ''Sun'' is portrayed as having many deeply dysfunctional qualities while also having very dedicated people on its staff. The season focuses on the role of the media in affecting political decisions in  City Hall  Baltimore  City Hall  and the priorities of the  Baltimore Police Department . Additionally, the show explores the business pressures of modern media through layoffs and buyouts occurring at the ''Sun'', on the orders of the  Tribune Company , the corporate owner of the ''Sun''.  One storyline involves a troubled ''Sun'' reporter named  Scott Templeton  with an escalating tendency of sensationalizing and falsifying stories. ''The Wire'' portrays the managing editors of the ''Sun'' as turning a blind eye to the protests of a concerned line editor in the search for a  Pulitzer Prize . The show insinuates that the motivation for this institutional dysfunction is the business pressures of modern media, and working for a flagship newspaper in a major media market like '' The New York Times '' or '' The Washington Post '' is seen as the only way to avoid the cutbacks occurring at the ''Sun''.   The Wire  season 5  Season 5  was ''The Wire''s last. The last episode, "" -30-  The Wire episode  -30- "", features a montage at the end portraying the ultimate fate of the major characters. It shows Templeton at Columbia University with the senior editors of the fictional ''Sun'' accepting the Pulitzer Prize, with no mention being made as to the aftermath of Templeton's career.

472,1,thewalrus.ca,Category 2003 establishments in Ontario Category All articles needing additional references Category Articles needing additional references from April 2017 Category Canadian cultural magazines Category Magazines established in 2003 Category Magazines published in Toronto,"    issn                 1708-4032    '''''The Walrus''''' is a  Canada Canadian  general interest  magazine  which publishes  long-form journalism  on Canadian and international affairs, along with fiction and poetry by Canadian writers.    History        Creation     In 2002,  David Berlin , a former editor and owner of the '' Literary Review of Canada '', began promoting his vision of a world-class Canadian magazine. This led him to meet with then-''Harper's'' editor  Lewis H. Lapham  to discuss creating a ""''Harper's'' North,"" which would combine the American magazine with 40 pages of Canadian content. As Berlin searched for funding to create that content, a mutual friend put him in touch with Ken Alexander, a former high school English and history teacher and then senior producer of  CBC Newsworld 's  CounterSpin  television program  CounterSpin . Like Berlin, Alexander was hoping to found an intelligent Canadian magazine that dealt with world affairs.  Before long, the Chawkers Foundation, run by Alexander's family, had agreed to provide the prospective magazine with $5 million over five years, and the George Cedric Metcalf Charitable Foundation promised $150,000 for an internship program. This provided enough money to get by without the partnership with ''Harper's''.      Name     The "" walrus "" name was at first a working title, but quickly grew on the staff of the magazine. According to their website, the rationale behind it was ""to dissociate this country with the 'log chomping' and 'earnestness' of our national animal  and cliché , the beaver""; the walrus, just as much a Canadian native, is ""curmudgeonly but clever, bulky but agile  if only in water .""      Magazine     Berlin resigned as editor in 2004, and Ken Alexander ended his tumultuous reign as publisher, then editor, in June 2008. John Macfarlane, former editor-in-chief of '' Toronto Life '' and publisher of '' Saturday Night  magazine  Saturday Night '', joined ''The Walrus'' in July 2008 as editor and co-publisher. With newly returned art director Brian Morgan, Macfarlane oversaw a revamping of the editorial and art direction of the magazine. The new ''Walrus'' was to be more consistent and current, with a ""far more internally driven"" process for story selection, and the reworked cover featuring illustrations that correspond to each issue's content.  ''The Walrus'' soon began to receive critical acclaim  its two 2003 issues alone garnered eleven National Magazine Award nominations and three wins, In 2006, it won the  Canadian National Magazine Awards National Magazine Award  for Magazine of the Year in Canada. As of April 2017, it has consistently led in the National Magazine Awards, earning a total of 70 wins and 231 nominations to date. The two companies plan on creating more documentaries in the future.      Unpaid internship programme     In March 2014, ''The Walrus'' was required to shut down its unpaid internship programme after the Ontario Ministry of Labour declared that its longstanding practice of not paying interns was in contravention of the Employment Standards Act.  In October 2015, a report in  Canadaland  provided details of a toxic and disorganized environment at the magazine.    Finances   Though ''The Walrus'' was initially pledged $1 million annually by the Chawkers Foundation for its first five years, it was unable to access this money without first being recognized as a charitable organization by the Canada Revenue Agency. Ken Alexander was forced to support the magazine out of his own pocket until it finally received charitable status in 2005, creating the charitable non-profit Walrus Foundation. In addition to publishing the magazine, the Foundation runs events across Canada, including talks and debates on public policy.  In the relatively small and geographically dispersed Canadian market, magazines producing long-form journalism have often struggled to stay afloat. ''Saturday Night'', which ''The Walrus'' editor John Macfarlane formerly published, lost money continuously despite being a celebrated publication. But as Macfarlane reports, ''The Walrus'''s charitable model, similar to that of ''Harper's'', is so far sustaining it  donations covered about half of the costs of producing the magazine in 2010, with the traditional revenue streams of circulation and advertising providing the rest.

Jack Kemp  of New York, Sen.  Jesse Helms  of North Carolina, Sen.  James L. Buckley  of New York, Rep.  Phil Crane  of Illinois, and Rep  Eric Cantor  of Virginia. In 1985, ALEC also published a memo that opposed ""the current homosexual movement"", portrayed  homosexuality  as a result of a conscious choice, and said that  pedophilia  was ""one of the more dominant practices within the homosexual world"". Lori Roman, who served in the same role from 2006 to 2008, had an imperious style that led to financial difficulties and the departure of two thirds of ALEC's staff.  The criticism among media outlets and political opponents was that ALEC was secretly subverting democratic institutions to further the aims of its corporate benefactors.  The  shooting of Trayvon Martin  on February 26, 2012 led to increased public attention on  Stand-your-ground law ""Stand-your-ground"" gun laws  that ALEC had supported.  Newt Gingrich  aide, and  GOPAC  executive director, Lisa B. Nelson, succeeded Scheberle as CEO of ALEC in 2014.  T-Mobile  and  BP  severed ties with ALEC in 2015. It also has approximately 300 corporate, foundation, and other private-sector members. Former ALEC co-chairman  Noble Ellington  said in 2011, ""I really kind of think of us as one board,"" although he added, ""It’s certainly not our goal to sit there and do everything that business wants to have done.""  ALEC also has a ""Board of Scholars"" that advises staff and members. The board is composed of  Arthur Laffer , an economist who served on  Ronald Reagan 's  Economic Policy Advisory Board ; Victor Schwartz, chair of Public Policy at  Shook, Hardy & Bacon ; and ALEC is an associate member of the SPN.    Notable policies and model bills   The ALEC website states that its goal is to advance ""the fundamental principles of free-market enterprise, limited government, and federalism"".  A  Brookings Institution  study of state legislation introduced in 2011–2012 found that ALEC model bills that became law were linked most often to controversial social and economic issues. The study concluded that this phenomenon has hurt ALEC because, ""Dirtying its hands with social issues undermines ALEC's ability to exercise influence over fiscal ones."" Enacted in 2010, SB 1070 was described as the toughest  illegal immigration  law in the U.S.     Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act    One of ALEC's model bills is the ""Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act"", which classifies certain property destruction, acts of intimidation, and  civil disobedience  by environmental and  animal rights  activists as  terrorism . This model bill appeared across the U.S. in various forms since it was drafted in 2003. The federal "" Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act "" has notable similarities, and at points almost verbatim language, to ALEC's model ""Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act"". The Senate version of the "" Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act "" was sponsored by Senator  James Inhofe , a long-time member of ALEC. Critics argue that by funding and participating in ALEC's Criminal Justice Task Force,  private prison  companies directly influence legislation for tougher, longer sentences.  Corrections Corporation of America  and  Wackenhut Corrections , two of the largest for-profit prison companies in the U.S.   , have been contributors to ALEC. Economist  Paul Krugman  wrote in 2012 that ALEC had ""a special interest in privatization—that is, on turning the provision of public services, from schools to prisons, over to for-profit corporations,"" and as such played a significant role in the "" Prison–industrial complex penal–industrial complex "". As an example, Krugman wrote that the  American Bail Coalition  had declared publicly that ALEC was its ""life preserver.""  Also in 2013, ALEC adopted a model bill saying that the role of human activity in causing  climate change  was uncertain, that man-made climate change could be ""deleterious, neutral or possibly beneficial,"" and that the cost of regulating  greenhouse gas emissions  could cause ""great economic dislocation."" ALEC also has invited climate change skeptics, such as  Craig Idso , to speak at its national meetings. In 2015  Common Cause  and the  League of Conservation Voters  pointed to such behavior to accuse ALEC of  climate change denial denying climate change . ALEC responded by threatening legal action, denying that ALEC supports climate change denial, and saying it has more recently welcomed debate on the subject and supported  renewable energy  and  carbon tax  policies to curb global warming.  British Petroleum , Names of its 172-member task force, the agenda of a December 2010 meeting, and its minutes that included a resolution regarding  traffic pumping  were published by  Common Cause . Health insurance experts have predicted that if the bill were widely adopted by Republican-controlled states, it would seriously disrupt the exchange and threaten the ACA.     Other issues    ALEC has worked to privatize public education, Governor  Sam Brownback , who promoted and signed the legislation, was advised by the  supply-side economist  and ALEC board member,  Arthur Laffer , who said at the time that the cuts would pay for themselves and lead to increased growth. ALEC's actions in funding and advising these efforts against ""plain packaging"" of tobacco products was cited as partial motivation for an academic study on the effectiveness of plain packaging, which found that ""plain packaging can reduce positive perceptions of smoking and dissuade tobacco use."" At one ALEC meeting, media experts gave messaging advice and taught legislators how to use  Twitter  to move ALEC bills through their chambers. Shortly after the Milbank incident, the  Brookings Institution  reported that ALEC's activities during its closed-door meetings are ""still a mystery"", and that ""ALEC could have a tremendous influence over lawmaking in the American states, or it could have none at all—we just don't know.""  One exception to this pattern came in November 2011, when former Florida State Representative  Rachel Burgin  introduced legislation to call on the federal government to reduce its corporate tax rate. She mistakenly included the  Boilerplate text boilerplate  ""WHEREAS, it is the mission of the American Legislative Exchange Council to advance Jeffersonian principles of free markets, limited government, federalism, and individual liberty...""  Arizona House of Representatives#Leadership information Arizona House of Representatives Assistant Minority Leader   Steve Farley , sponsor of the Arizona bill, argued that corporations have the right to present arguments, but not secretly. In one instance, a Wisconsin legislative representative had requested of ALEC in June 2012 that all correspondence be sent to his personal account. '' Bloomberg Businessweek '' described the organization as a ""bill laundry"" that ""offers companies substantial benefits that seem to have little to do with ideology."" ""ALEC is unique in the sense that it puts legislators and companies together and they create policy collectively,"" said  Scott Pruitt , then an Oklahoma state representative and ALEC task force chair. said in 2012, ""Legislators don't sit down with a quill pen and draft legislation. I think legislators should have the right to turn to wherever they want to get the ideas they prefer... I have some confidence that they're not being flimflammed."" although Delores Mertz, who had previously served as chairwoman of the ALEC board, said she was ""concerned about the lobbying that's going on, especially with [ALEC's] 501 c 3 status"".  the IRS investigation remained open. In 2013 ALEC created a  501 c  organization#501 c  4  501 c  4  organization  called the ""Jeffersonian Project"" that, according to ''The Guardian'', ""would allow Alec to be far more overt in its lobbying activities than its current charitable status as a 501 c  3 "". ALEC's total revenue in 2011 was $9 million. According to the  Center For Public Integrity , ALEC received $150,000 from Charles and David Koch in 2011.   On their 2016 tax return ALEC reported an increase in total revenue from $9.0 million the prior year to $10.3 million.     Further reading      Alex Hertel-Fernande. 2019.

ALEC has produced model bills on a broad range of issues, such as reducing  regulation and individual and corporate taxation, combating illegal immigration, loosening environmental regulations, tightening voter identification rules, weakening labor unions, and opposing gun control. Some of these bills dominate legislative agendas in states such as Arizona, Wisconsin, Colorado, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Maine. Approximately 200 model bills become law each year. ALEC also serves as a networking tool among certain state legislators, allowing them to research conservative policies implemented in other states. Many ALEC legislators say the organization converts campaign rhetoric and nascent policy ideas into legislative language.ALEC's activities, while legal, received public scrutiny after being reported by liberal groups in 2011 and after news reports from outlets such as The New York Times and Bloomberg Businessweek described ALEC as an organization that gave corporate interests outsized influence.

These subjects ranged from fiscal to monetary policy and from health care to energy, and authors included  Earl Butz ,  John Lintner , former New Dealer  Raymond Moley , and  Felix Morley . Brown died in 1951, and AEA languished. In 1952, a group of young policymakers and public intellectuals—including Laird,  William J.

Other AEI staff have argued for similar policies. and  ethanol   While the report was being drafted, Kagan and Keane were briefing President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and other senior Bush administration officials behind the scenes. According to  Bob Woodward , "" Peter Schoomaker [Peter J.] Schoomaker  was outraged when he saw news coverage that retired Gen.  Jack Keane , the former Army vice chief of staff, had briefed the president on December 11 about a new Iraq strategy being proposed by the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative think tank. 'When does AEI start trumping the  Joint Chiefs of Staff  on this stuff?' Schoomaker asked at the next chiefs' meeting."" Kagan authored three subsequent reports monitoring the progress of the surge.  Papers in AEI's Tocqueville on China Project series ""elicit the underlying civic culture of post- Mao Zedong Mao  China, enabling policymakers to better understand the internal forces and pressures that are shaping China's future"".

Hess coauthored ''Diplomas and Dropouts'', but Hess has been critical of school vouchers  ""[I]t is by now clear that aggressive reforms to bring market principles to American education have failed to live up to their billing. ... In the school choice debate, many reformers have gotten so invested in the language of 'choice' that they seem to forget choice is only half of the market equation. Markets are about both supply and demand—and, while 'choice' is concerned with emboldening consumer demand, the real action when it comes to prosperity, productivity, and progress is typically on the supply side."" In 2014, the  Charity evaluator charity evaluating  service  American Institute of Philanthropy  gave AEI an ""A-"" grade in its CharityWatch ""Top-Rated Charities"" listing. In 2010, AEI received a 2.5 million grant from the  Donors Capital Fund , a  donor-advised fund . After this, AEI's officers scrupulously attempted to avoid even the appearance of political advocacy. This offer was criticized as  bribery .

Christopher DeMuth , former AEI president, accepted that the earth has warmed in recent decades, but he stated that ""it's not clear why this happened"" and charged as well that the IPCC ""has tended to ignore many distinguished physicists and meteorologists whose work casts doubt on the influence of greenhouse gases on global temperature trends"".  After  United States Secretary of Energy Energy Secretary   Steven Chu  recommended painting roofs and roads white in order to reflect sunlight back into space and therefore reduce global warming, AEI's magazine ''The American'' endorsed the idea. It also stated that ""ultimately we need to look more broadly at creative ways of reducing the harmful effects of climate change in the long run.""   AEI visiting scholar  N. Gregory Mankiw  wrote in '' The New York Times '' in support of a  carbon tax  on September 16, 2007. He remarked that ""there is a broad consensus. The scientists tell us that world temperatures are rising because humans are emitting carbon into the atmosphere. Basic economics tells us that when you tax something, you normally get less of it.""

Ten's news division also assists in the production of the current affairs program '' The Project  Australian TV program  The Project ''. It draws upon the resources of  CBS News   whose parent company also owns Network 10 ,  ITN ,  Associated Press Television News APTN  and  Reuters  for select international coverage.    History    Network Ten  introduced its News service in 1965, with the networks founding and was a pioneering force behind the concept of the hour-long news bulletin  the other rival networks where presenting 30 minutes  co-anchored in the form of '' Eyewitness News '' from 1973 onwards. The 1980s were the network's most successful period as a news provider with its local Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane bulletins often rating highest for their 6pm timeslots.

In September 2010, the network announced a major expansion of its news service. From 24 January 2011, It expanded its evening news output by introducing a national current affairs program at 6pm, '' 6.30 with George Negus 6PM with George Negus ''  later ''6.30 with George Negus'' , and an extra local bulletin at 6 30pm on weeknights, with the ''Ten Evening News'' brand reinstated. In addition, the network announced the re-introduction of local weekend bulletins at 6pm and the axing of its 5pm national bulletin.  Two months after the relaunch, the national weekend bulletins were re-introduced owing to poor ratings, although the 6pm local bulletins continued to air. Later that month, the network dropped its 6 30pm local bulletins on weeknights, extended ''Ten News at Five'' to 90 minutes and moved George Negus' program to 6 30pm each weeknight. The changes were introduced on Monday 4 April 2011. and the state-based 6pm weekend bulletins. The 5pm national bulletin on Saturdays and Sundays was extended to 90 minutes a month later. Two months later, a new breakfast program, '' Wake Up  TV program  Wake Up '', was launched.  On 21 May 2014, Network Ten announced it would axe ''Wake Up'' and all national news bulletins on weekdays as part of a wider cost cutting program with the loss of around 150 jobs, caused by poor ratings and advertising revenue.  Until July 2014, a separate edition for Perth and Western Australia was also broadcast from the Pyrmont studios in Sydney. The lack of a separate up-to-date edition of ''Ten Eyewitness News Weekend'' for Perth has led to criticisms when outdated time-sensitive news has been broadcast in Western Australia, as in the case of a local 8-year-old junior drag racing accident victim who had died in hospital several hours prior to Ten airing the three-hour-old national bulletin reporting that she was still alive. after presenting his final 5pm Sydney program as main anchor on Friday 16 January 2009.

It was one of the most well-known and vehement pro-War on Terrorism websites in the early days of the blogosphere.   Johnson stated in 2006   Image Killian memos MSWord animated.gif right thumb   Image Killian memos MSWord animated.gif The animated GIF image  created by Charles Johnson and posted at LGF, comparing a 2004-era Microsoft Word document made with default settings to the document that CBS presented as a typewritten memo from 1973. LGF was one of four sources, along with the  Power Line  blog  Power Line  and  Allah Is in the House Allahpundit  blogs and the  Free Republic  discussion forum, who conducted the initial investigation of  Dan Rather 's assertions on '' 60 Minutes '' that the Killian documents were genuine.     Charitable contributions    Little Green Footballs supporters have helped raise thousands of dollars for  Spirit of America  company  Spirit of America 's ""Friends of Iraq Blogger Challenge"". from Little Green Footballs.     Doctored photographs     On August 5, 2006, LGF showed how a photograph of  Beirut  after an Israeli air strike taken by  Reuters  photographer   Adnan Hajj photographs controversy Adnan Hajj  was manipulated before being published by Reuters. Fox News credited the website for discovering the doctored photos.     Awards    Little Green Footballs once had two annual awards; The Fiskie and The Fallaci.  The Fiskie was named after journalist  Robert Fisk , in a blog post Johnson unilaterally awarded the Fiskie to  Glenn Beck . in posts about global warming.      Palestinian child abuse     Johnson often posts photos taken by Associated Press and Reuters photographers, among others, of Palestinians dressing their children in paramilitary uniforms, or in clothing emblazoned with violent slogans such as ""Death to Israel."" These children are often shown carrying real guns and even wearing mock-ups of the explosive belts used by suicide bombers. Johnson refers to such photographs as evidence of Palestinian  child abuse . Johnson disputes the ISM's account, holding that Corrie, who was regularly mocked as ""Saint Pancake"" on his website, was ""trying to 'protect' a house used for drugs and weapons smuggling"".  In support of this view, he has cited and those who endorse it. He is particularly critical of Louisiana Governor  Bobby Jindal  on this point. In 2009, he stated that the Republican Party's having visible advocates of Intelligent Design is one of the reasons that the Democrats were in power.     Post-2009         Edward Snowden     Johnson has been critical of  Edward Snowden  and his  Global surveillance disclosures  2013–present  disclosures . In 2014, he asserted that ""Snowden himself committed a truly massive violation of civil liberties"".     Rivalries    Johnson and LGF ""regulars""  the self-proclaimed "" Reptilian humanoid Lizardoids ""  have engaged in a number of high-profile  feud s and  Flaming  Internet  flame wars , pitting LGF supporters against readers of other blogs  e.g.,  Daily Kos  and later  Michelle Malkin#Hot Air website and MichelleMalkin.com Hot Air   and alternative media sites  e.g.,  Fark  and  Digg  .  As of 2014, one of Charles Johnson's main targets is an  alt-right  figure and well-known  Internet troll  with the same first and last name as him. When speaking of  Charles C. Johnson , the LGF owner takes pains to point out that this doppelganger ""is not me.""    Controversies       Allegations of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim sentiment     R. J. Smith, writing in ''Los Angeles Magazine'', stated that LGF is a ""dysfunctional mix of beautiful photos Johnson takes on coastal bike rides and constitutionally protected hate speech"" which ""believes all Muslims are terrorists until proven innocent.""    Ibrahim Hooper , spokesman for the  Council of American Islamic Relations   CAIR  called Little Green Footballs ""a vicious, anti-Muslim hate site"" and says that the FBI has ""investigated several threats of physical harm against Muslims posted by Little Green Footballs readers"".     Google and Websense     In March 2005, Johnson called attention to Google's inclusion of the  white supremacist   National Vanguard  American organization  National Vanguard  site  and simultaneous exclusion of LGF  in its news index; the NV site has since been dropped. Websense admitted that the site had been thus categorized briefly  but incorrectly  and subsequently reversed the decision.     Statements about Ron Paul     Johnson removed Ron Paul's name from straw polls regarding the  United States presidential election, 2008 2008 Republican Presidential nomination campaign , asserting that Ron Paul's supporters were fraudulently gaming the vote script to increase Paul's numbers  ""The bottom line  if Ron Paul supporters weren’t spamming, he would still be in our polls. I really don’t have any nefarious motives here; I just don’t like being gamed, and since I run these silly unscientific polls I don’t have to put up with it.""    ''Little Green Footballs has moved, over the space of a few weeks, from mercilessly mocking  Ron Paul  and banning him from its straw polls to putting him at the center of a conspiracy for worldwide Nazi domination. ''  Johnson's allegations were picked up in the '' New York Times '' ""Medium"" section, where  Virginia Heffernan  cited LGF's coverage of claims by  Bill White  neo-nazi  Bill White , writing  This resulted in a falling out with several other prominent right-wing bloggers, including  Diana West ,     2005     '' Vanity Fair  magazine  Vanity Fair '' theater critic  James Wolcott  characterized the LGF community as ''""sort of like a disorganized  Nuremberg Rally , a lot of angry ruffians with nowhere to go....""''     2006      Pajamas Media  contributor  Catherine Seipp Cathy Seipp  wrote in '' National Review '' that    ''I'm losing patience with this notion, surely one of the most successful media  Big Lie s of the past few years, that Charles runs a racist hate site. By now it's been repeated so often that even normally reasonable people believe it.''     2009     Charles Johnson and LGF received attention from the leftist blog the '' Huffington Post '' because of a blog post of Johnsons disassociating himself from "" Right-wing politics the right""  because of perceived, ""anti-Islamic bigotry that goes far beyond simply criticizing radical Islam, into support for  fascism , violence, and genocide,"" embracing of conspiracy theories, and hate speech. Johnson later criticized the article for its negative slant and for lending too much weight to the opinions of people whom, Johnson wrote, the ''Times'' would ""normally assign to the 'wacko far right bigot' category"".

Its  broadsheet  daily edition is distributed throughout the  District of Columbia  and in parts of  Maryland  and  Virginia . A weekly  tabloid  newspaper format  tabloid  edition aimed at a national audience is also published.  Bo Hi Pak , the chief aide of church founder and leader  Sun Myung Moon , was the founding president and the founding chairman of the board. In 2002, at an event held to celebrate ''The Washington Times'' 20th anniversary, Moon said  ""''The Washington Times'' is responsible to let the American people know about God"" and ""''The Washington Times'' will become the instrument in spreading the truth about God to the world."" When ''The Washington Times'' began it had 125 reporters, 25 percent of them Unification Church members. Three years later, editorial page editor William P. Cheshire and four of his staff resigned, charging that, at the explicit direction of Sang Kook Han, a top official of the Unification movement, then-editor Arnaud de Borchgrave had stifled editorial criticism of political repression in South Korea. Borchgrave was credited for encouraging energetic reporting by staff, but was known to make unorthodox journalistic decisions. During his tenure, ''The Washington Times'' mounted a fund-raising drive for  Contras  rebels in  Nicaragua  and offered rewards for information leading to the arrest of  Nazi war criminals . In 1997 he said, ""The American people know the truth. You, my friends at ''The Washington Times'', have told it to them. It wasn't always the popular thing to do. But you were a loud and powerful voice. Like me, you arrived in Washington at the beginning of the most momentous decade of the century. Together, we rolled up our sleeves and got to work. And—oh, yes—we won the Cold War."" During his editorship, the paper took a strongly conservative stance. Controversy ensued when Pruden was accused of pushing  Nativism  politics  nativism .  In 1992, ''The Washington Times'' had only one-eighth the circulation of the ''Post''  100,000 compared to 800,000  and that two-thirds of its subscribers also subscribed to the ''Post''.  In 1997 the '' Washington Report on Middle East Affairs ,'' which is critical of U.S. and Israeli policies, praised ''The Washington Times'' along with '' The Christian Science Monitor ,'' owned by the  Church of Christ, Scientist , and ''The Washington Times'' sister publication '' News World Communications The Middle East Times ,'' for what it called their objective and informative coverage of Islam and the  Middle East , while criticizing the generally pro-Israel editorial policy of ''The Washington Times''. The ''Report'' suggested that these newspapers, being owned by religious institutions, were less influenced by pro-Israel pressure groups in the United States.    In 2006 Moon's second oldest son  Hyun Jin Moon , president and CEO of ''The Washington Times''  parent company   News World Communications , was in the process of ousting managing editor Francis Coombs because of accusations of  racist  editorializing. Coombs had made a number of racist and sexist comments, for which he was in the process of being sued by his colleagues. In August 2010, a deal was made to sell ''The Washington Times'' to a group more closely related to the movement. Editor in chief  Sam Dealey  said that this was a welcome development among ''The Washington Times'' staff. ''The Washington Times'' president Tom McDevitt took his place as chairman, and Larry Beasley was hired as the company's new president and chief executive officer.

In 1955 the  Vivian Bose  Commission of Inquiry found that Ramkrishna Dalmia, in 1947, had engineered the acquisition of the media giant  The Times Group Bennett Coleman & Co.  by transferring money from a bank and an insurance company of which he was the Chairman. In the court case that followed, Ramkrishna Dalmia was sentenced to two years in  Tihar Jail  after having been convicted of embezzlement and fraud. Following that order, Shanti Prasad Jain ceased to be a director and the company ran with new directors on board, appointed by the Government of India, with the exception of a lone stenographer of the Jains. Curiously, the court appointed  Nanasaheb Kunte D K Kunte  as Chairman of the Board. Kunte had no prior business experience and was also an opposition member of the  Lok Sabha .     Back to the Jain family    In 1976, during the  Emergency  India  Emergency  in India, the Government transferred ownership of the newspaper back to  Ashok Kumar Jain    Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain 's son,  Ramkrishna Dalmia 's grandson and the father of  Samir Jain  and  Vineet Jain  . The move was a critique of Prime Minister  Indira Gandhi 's 21-month state of emergency, which is now widely known as ""the Emergency"" and seen by many as a roundly  authoritarian  era of Indian government.

'' Cricbuzz ''  In November 2014, Times Internet acquired Cricbuzz, a website focused on  cricket  news.   Critics have claimed that the company’s paid news and private treaties skew its coverage and shield its newspaper advertisers from scrutiny.  The Hoot , a media criticism website, has pointed out that when an elevator in a 19 storey luxury apartment complex in Bangalore crashed killing two workers and injuring seven, all the English language and  Kannada  language newspapers with the exception of the Times of India called out the name of the construction company, Sobha Developers, which was a private-treaty partner. An article titled “reaping gold through bt cotton,” which first appeared in the Nagpur edition of the Times of India in 2008, reappeared unchanged in 2011, this time with a small print alert that the article was a ""marketing feature"". In both times the article was factually incorrect and made false claims about the success of  Monsanto 's genetically modified cotton. In 2005, when the  Honda  Motors plant in Gurgaon experienced an eight-month-long conflict between management and non-unionized workers over wages and work conditions, provoking violence and charges of police brutality, the Times of India covered the concerns of Honda and the harm done to India’s investment climate and largely ignored the issues raised by workers.

Comparison with Amnesty International     Human Rights Watch and  Amnesty International  are the only two Western-oriented international human rights organizations operating in most situations of severe oppression or abuse worldwide.  Its documentations of human rights abuses often include extensive analysis of the political and historical backgrounds of the conflicts concerned, some of which have been published in academic journals. AI's reports, on the other hand, tend to contain less analysis, and instead focus on specific abuses of rights.     Financing and services    For the financial year ending June 2008, HRW reported receiving approximately US$44 million in public donations.  Financier and philanthropist  George Soros  of the  Open Society Institute Open Society Foundation  announced in 2010 his intention to grant US $100 million to HRW over a period of ten years to help it expand its efforts internationally. He said, ""Human Rights Watch is one of the most effective organizations I support. Human rights underpin our greatest aspirations  they're at the heart of open societies.""

It was a finalist in 1982 for its coverage of a Haitian refugee boat disaster, and again in 1999 for its powerful coverage of  Hurricane Mitch  in Central America. In 1925, the ''Everglades Breeze'' was renamed the ''Sentinel''.  That same year, two Ohio publishers bought both the ''Sentinel'' and the ''Herald'', consolidating the newspapers into a daily publication called the ''Daily News and Evening Sentinel''. In the 1970s, the morning paper changed its name to the ''Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel''. In 1982, the two papers merged their editorial staffs.  On August 17, 2008, the ''Sun-Sentinel'' unveiled a redesigned layout, with larger graphics, more color, and a new large ""S"" logo. This is in tune with another Tribune newspaper  '' Orlando Sentinel '' , which redesigned its newspaper a few months previously, and created a brand synergy with Tribune sister operation and  The CW Television Network CW  affiliate  WSFL-TV   Channel 39 , which relocated its operations to the ''Sun-Sentinel'' offices in 2008 and adopted a logo matching the capital ""S"" in the new logo.  Since 2011 to present day, the newspaper made significant updates to meld print media with modern media. These advances include  launching the pure-play entertainment website SouthFlorida.com and starting a video channel called ''SunSentinel Originals''. As a result of their media integration, the newspaper was named one of ''Editor & Publisher'''s ""10 Newspapers That Do it Right"".    Awards   The ''Sun-Sentinel'' gives annual awards to area businesses and business leaders, including Top Workplaces for People on the Move, Excalibur Award and others.  In April 2013, the ''Sun-Sentinel'' won its first gold medal  Pulitzer Prize for Public Service .

It also absorbed ''The Week-end Review'' in 1934  one element of which survives in the shape of the ''New Statesman''s Weekly Competition, and the other the 'This England' feature . The Competition feature, in which readers submitted jokes and often parodies and pastiches of the work of famous authors, became one of the most famous parts of the magazine. After the 1938 '' Anschluss '', Martin wrote  ""Today if  Neville Chamberlain Mr. Chamberlain  would come forward and tell us that his policy was really one not only of isolation but also of  Little Englander Little Englandism  in which the  British Empire Empire  was to be given up because it could not be defended and in which military defence was to be abandoned because war would totally end civilization, we for our part would wholeheartedly support him."" Martin was irritated by Keynes's article but still allowed it to be printed. Martin also refused to allow any of the magazine's writers to review  Leon Trotsky 's anti-Stalinist book '' The Revolution Betrayed ''. The magazine also condemned the  Winter War Soviet Invasion of Finland . Although the action was settled out of court for a minimal sum, over Jeffrey's plans, it was sold to  Geoffrey Robinson , the Labour MP and businessman. Following  Steve Platt 's resignation, Robinson appointed a former editor of '' The Independent '' ,  Ian Hargreaves , on what was at the time an unprecedentedly high salary. Hargreaves fired most of the left-wingers on the staff and turned the ''Statesman'' into a strong supporter of  Tony Blair  being Labour's leader.

Campbell responded  ""I had no idea she worked for the ''New Statesman''. I don't read the ''Mail on Sunday''.

In 1896, The "" Dow Jones Industrial Average "" was officially launched. It was the first of several indices of stock and bond prices on the  New York Stock Exchange . In 1899, the ''Journal'' Review & Outlook column, which still runs today, appeared for the first time, initially written by Charles Dow.  Journalist  Clarence Barron  purchased control of the company for US$130,000 in 1902; circulation was then around 7,000 but climbed to 50,000 by the end of the 1920s. Barron and his predecessors were credited with creating an atmosphere of fearless, independent financial reporting—a novelty in the early days of  business journalism . In 1921,  Barron's  newspaper  Barron's , the United States's premier financial weekly, was founded.  1971 to 1997 brought about a series of launches, acquisitions, and joint ventures, including "" Factiva "", '' The Wall Street Journal Asia '', '' The Wall Street Journal Europe '', the WSJ.com website, Dow Jones Indexes,  MarketWatch , and ""WSJ Weekend Edition"". In 2007,  News Corp.  acquired Dow Jones. '' WSJ. '', a luxury lifestyle magazine, was launched in 2008. In 2003, Dow Jones began to integrate reporting of the ''Journal'' print and online subscribers together in  Audit Bureau of Circulations  North America  Audit Bureau of Circulations  statements.  Many of ''The Wall Street Journal'' news stories are available through free online newspapers that subscribe to the Dow Jones  syndicate . Pulitzer Prize–winning stories from 1995 are available free on the Pulitzer  In 2007, the ''Journal'' launched a worldwide expansion of its website to include major foreign-language editions. The paper had also shown an interest in buying the rival '' Financial Times ''.  On September 5, 2006, the ''Journal'' included advertising on its front page for the first time. This followed the introduction of front-page advertising on the European and Asian editions in late 2005. – the paper in 2007 decreased its  broadsheet  width from 15 to 12inches while keeping the length at 22inches, to save  newsprint  costs. News design consultant  Mario García  designer  Mario Garcia  collaborated on the changes. Dow Jones said it would save US$18million a year in newsprint costs across all ''The Wall Street Journal'' papers. in addition to photographs, a method of illustration considered a consistent visual signature of the paper. The ''Journal'' still heavily employs the use of  caricatures , notably those of  Ken Fallin , such as when  Peggy Noonan  memorialized then-recently deceased newsman  Tim Russert .     News Corporation and News Corp    On May 2, 2007,  News Corporation  made an unsolicited takeover bid for Dow Jones, offering US$60 a share for stock that had been selling for US$33 a share. The  Bancroft family , which controlled more than 60% of the voting stock, at first rejected the offer, but later reconsidered its position. The US$5billion sale added ''The Wall Street Journal'' to  Rupert Murdoch 's news empire, which already included  Fox News Channel ,  Fox Business Network financial network unit  and London's '' The Times '', and locally within New York, the '' New York Post '', along with  Fox Broadcasting Company Fox   flagship station   WNYW   Channel 5  and  MyNetworkTV  flagship  WWOR-TV WWOR   Channel 9 .  In an editorial page column, publisher  L.&nbsp;Gordon Crovitz  said the Bancrofts and News Corporation had agreed that the ''Journal''s news and opinion sections would preserve their editorial independence from their new corporate parent   A 2007 ''Journal'' article quoted charges that Murdoch had made and broken similar promises in the past. One large shareholder commented that Murdoch has long ""expressed his personal, political and business biases through his newspapers and television stations"". Former '' The Times Times '' assistant editor Fred Emery remembers an incident when ""Mr. Murdoch called him into his office in March 1982 and said he was considering firing Times editor  Harold Evans . Mr. Emery says he reminded Mr. Murdoch of his promise that editors couldn't be fired without the independent directors' approval. 'God, you don't take all that seriously, do you?' Mr. Murdoch answered, according to Mr. Emery."" Murdoch eventually forced out Evans. The case came to light after a Belgian ''Wall Street Journal'' employee,  Gert Van Mol , informed Dow Jones CEO  Les Hinton  about the questionable practice.

In December 2017, the editorial board repeated its calls for Mueller's resignation. The ''Journal'' has been accused of refusing to publish opinions of scientists which present the mainstream view on climate change.  In a 2004 study, Tim Groseclose and  Jeffrey Milyo Jeff Milyo  argue the ''Journal'' news pages have a pro-liberal bias because they more often quote liberal think tanks. They calculated the ideological attitude of news reports in 20 media outlets by counting the frequency they cited particular  think tank s and comparing that to the frequency that legislators cited the same think tanks. They found that the news reporting of ''The Journal'' was the most liberal  more liberal than  NPR  or '' The New York Times '' . The study did not factor in editorials. about whether the news pages would exhibit a rightward slant under  Rupert Murdoch . An August 1 editorial responded to the questions by asserting that Murdoch intended to ""maintain the values and integrity of the ''Journal''.""

In 2004,  Robert Greenwald 's documentary film '' Outfoxed  Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism '' argued Fox News had a conservative bias and featured clips from Fox News and internal memos from editorial vice president  John Moody  journalist  John Moody  directing Fox News staff on how to report certain subjects.  Surveys suggest Fox News is widely perceived to be ideological. A 2009 Pew survey found Fox News is viewed as the most ideological channel in America, with 47 percent of those surveyed said Fox News is ""mostly conservative"", 14 percent said ""mostly liberal"" and 24 percent said ""neither"". In comparison,  MSNBC  had 36 percent identify it as ""mostly liberal"", 11 percent as ""mostly conservative"" and 27 percent as ""neither"".  CNN  had 37 percent describe it as ""mostly liberal"", 11 percent as ""mostly conservative"" and 33 percent as ""neither"".   A May 2017 study conducted by  Harvard University 's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy examined coverage of Trump's  First 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency first 100 days  in office by several major mainstream media outlets including Fox. The instructions came after a number of Fox News hosts and guests made incendiary comments about  Trump administration family separation policy the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents .  On November 4, 2018, Trump's website, DonaldJTrump.com, announced in a press release that Fox News host Sean Hannity would make a ""special guest appearance"" with Trump at a midterm campaign rally the following night in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. Hosts and guests on Fox News called for Mueller to be fired. Paul Waldman of the ''Washington Post'' described the coverage as ""No puppet. You're the puppet"", saying it was a ""careful, coordinated, and comprehensive strategy"" to distract from Mueller's investigation. On November 1, 2017, ''Vox'' analyzed the transcripts of Fox News, CNN and MSNBC, and found Fox News ""was unable to talk about the Mueller investigation without bringing up Hillary Clinton"", ""talked significantly less about George Papadopoulos — the Trump campaign adviser whose plea deal with Mueller provides the most explicit evidence thus far that the campaign knew of the Russian government's efforts to help Trump — than its competitors"", and ""repeatedly called Mueller's credibility into question"". At the same time, most other national mainstream media gave wall-to-wall coverage of the convictions. Fox News omitted that Tapper had said the use of ""Allahu Akbar"" in the terrorist attack was not one of these beautiful circumstances. After Fox News had deleted the tweet, Sean Hannity repeated the misrepresentation and called Tapper ""liberal fake news CNN's fake Jake Tapper"" and mocked his ratings. The report cited an inaccurate assertion by Gen. Tony Thomas, the head of the United States Special Operations Command, that a major newspaper had disclosed the intelligence.     Climate change    According to the fact-checking website  Climate Feedback , Fox News is part of ""a network of unreliable outlets for climate news.""  In 2001, Sean Hannity described the  Scientific opinion on climate change scientific consensus on climate change  as ""phony science from the left."" Fox News ran a lead story about a private investigator's uncorroborated claims about the  murder of Seth Rich , a  Democratic National Committee DNC  staffer. Other news organizations quickly revealed the investigator was a Donald Trump supporter and had according to ''NBC News'' ""developed a reputation for making outlandish claims, such as&nbsp;one appearance&nbsp;on Fox News in 2007 in which he warned that underground networks of pink pistol-toting lesbian gangs were raping young women."" Max Boot of the  Council on Foreign Relations  said while intent behind Fox News, as a counterweight to the liberal media was laudable, the culmination of those efforts have been to create an alternative news source that promotes hoaxes and myths, of which the promotion of the Seth Rich conspiracy is an example. Beck regularly described Soros as a ""puppet-master"" and used common anti-Semitic tropes to refer to Soros and his activities. Prominent Fox News figures such as Roger Ailes, Bill O'Reilly and Eric Bolling were eventually fired after a multitude of women accused them of sexual harassment. At least four lawsuits alleged Fox News co-president  Bill Shine  ignored, enabled or concealed Roger Ailes' alleged sexual harassment. Ailes had the year before been fired from Fox News after a number of women alleged he sexually harassed them. A bureau chief said, ""If any member had been excluded it would have been the same thing, it has nothing to do with Fox or the White House or the substance of the issues"".  On October 2, 2013, Fox News host  Anna Kooiman  cited on the air a fake story from the ''National Report'' parody site, which claimed Obama had offered to keep the International Museum of Muslim Cultures open with cash from his own pocket. On April 9, 2018, federal agents from the  U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney's office  served a search warrant on the office and residence of   Michael Cohen  lawyer  Michael Cohen , Trump's personal attorney.

Its earliest antecedents date to 1801. As of January 1, 2016, the daily circulation of the paper was listed as 19,000 daily Monday-Saturday, with a Sunday circulation of 24,000.    History   The ''Williamsport Sun-Gazette'' was founded in 1801 as the ''Lycoming Gazette''.  At the time of the newspaper's conception, there were only 131 residents in the town of  Williamsport, Pennsylvania .  The newspaper was started in a building in what is now the vicinity of Penn Street and Washington Boulevard.  The ''Gazette'' name has been on the nameplate and masthead of a newspaper in Williamsport continuously since that time.  The ''Sun-Gazette'' is the oldest continuously operating enterprise in the West Branch Valley.  At over 216 years old, the ''Sun-Gazette'' is now the 10th-oldest newspaper in America and the fourth-oldest in Pennsylvania.  More than 32 other newspapers have operated and closed in the Williamsport area since 1801.  The ''Lycoming Gazette'' was a weekly paper from 1801 until 1867, when it was first published as a daily newspaper. The ''Lycoming Gazette'' then purchased the ''West Branch Bulletin'', which was founded in 1860, and merged in 1869 to become the ''Gazette and Bulletin'', which was a daily morning newspaper.  A rival newspaper, the ''Williamsport Sun'' printed for the first time on July 8, 1870 as an afternoon paper.     20th century    In 1955, the morning ''Gazette & Bulletin'' and the afternoon ''Williamsport Sun'' were consolidated and became the ''Williamsport Sun-Gazette'', the area's afternoon newspaper.  On July 1, 1990, the family-owned ''Sun-Gazette'' was acquired by another family owned newspaper group,  Ogden Newspapers , which operates more than 40 newspapers throughout the United States, including the ''East Lycoming Shopper & News'' and the ''Muncy Luminary'', both in Lycoming County.  In January 1991, the ''Sun-Gazette'' published the first Sunday edition, becoming a seven-day-a-week publication, including holidays.  Prior to that time, the '' Grit  newspaper  Grit '' newspaper was the Sunday paper for the area, until ''Grit'' was purchased and moved to  Topeka, Kansas  in 1993, later converting to magazine format. Coincidentally, both the ''Sun-Gazette'' and ''Grit'' are now owned by Ogden Newspapers.  On August 9, 1999, 130 years after the merger of the ''Lycoming Gazette'' and the ''West Branch Bulletin'', the ''Sun-Gazette'' returned to the morning edition format.  The ''Sun-Gazette'' has won numerous advertising, creative and editorial awards. It is nationally known for its coverage of the fracking industry, and also covers some news in neighboring counties, especially  Clinton County, Pennsylvania Clinton County ,  Tioga County, Pennsylvania Tioga County  and  Sullivan County, Pennsylvania Sullivan County .  It also covers  Penn State University  football and 17 local high school athletic programs.  The paper offers an almost exclusively conservative point of view, mainly through its original and syndicated editorials, as well as its selective use of articles from the  Associated Press . The daily local news reporting is generally fair. The ''Sun-Gazette''  often partners with the local community, through donation of advertising space in support of local civic, scholastic, and service organizations. In addition, the company offers editorial support to many Williamsport-area businesses and charities.    Online   In addition to the printed ''Sun-Gazette'', the newspaper has an online presence at SunGazette.com, which attracts over 165,000 unique visitors and averages over 1.9 million page views per month.

The paper began publication on August 10, 1863. By 1864, the newspaper had dropped “Valley” from its name, becoming simply the Napa Register until returning to the original name over a century later. Covering a community more known for its wheat crop than wine grapes, the early Register would be unrecognizable to modern readers. A forum for gossip, tall-tales, opinion, moral instruction, aphorisms, propaganda, entertainment and, sporadically, hard news, the Register was one of the top two newspapers of early Napa. The Register moved to daily publication in 1872 and George M. Francis became sole owner of the Register in 1878 upon the death of his business partner. Francis was succeeded in ownership by his son George H. Francis in 1932. The paper remained with Francis and various partners until 1958, when it was sold to Scripps League, a small family chain. The current editor is Sean Scully.  The Napa Valley Register is published by Napa Valley Publishing, which also publishes the St. Helena Star, The Weekly Calistogan, and American Canyon Eagle and operates the website Inside Napa Valley.

The Institute conducts work on issues including education reform,  government spending , taxation, healthcare, education,  tobacco smoking tobacco  policy,  global warming ,  hydraulic fracturing , information technology, and  free-market environmentalism .  In the 1990s, the Heartland Institute worked with the tobacco company  Altria Group Philip Morris  to attempt to discredit the health risks of  passive smoking secondhand smoke  and to lobby against  smoking ban s.  After the election of U.S. President  Barack Obama  in November 2008, the Institute became involved with the  Tea Party movement . According to the organization's director of communications, speaking at the sixth  International Conference on Climate Change  in 2011  ""The support of the Tea Party groups across the country has been extremely valuable."" as well as 222 unpaid policy advisers. The policy orientation of Heartland has been described as  Conservativism in the United States conservative ,  Libertarianism in the United States libertarian , and  right wing .     Tobacco regulation    Heartland has long questioned the links between tobacco smoking,  passive smoking secondhand smoke , and lung cancer and the social costs imposed by smokers.  A 1993 internal ""Five Year Plan"" from Philip Morris to address  passive smoking environmental tobacco smoke  regulation called for support for the efforts of the Institute. claims that the amount of climate change is not catastrophic, claims that climate change  Benefits of global warming might be beneficial , Heartland ""emerged as a leading force in climate change denial"" in the decade 2003–2013, according to sociology professor Riley Dunlap of  Oklahoma State University  and political science professor Peter J.

Heartland's list of scientists said to doubt global warming     In 2008, the Institute published a list purporting to identify ""500 Scientists with Documented Doubts of Man-Made Global Warming Scares"". The aggregated work of the NIPCC is known as ""Climate Change Reconsidered"" and concludes, in contradiction to the IPCC and the  Scientific opinion on climate change#Scientific consensus consensus of the scientific community , that human emissions will not lead to dangerous global warming and climate change. Conference speakers have included  Richard Lindzen , a professor of meteorology at MIT;  Roy Spencer  scientist  Roy Spencer , a research scientist and climatologist at the  University of Alabama in Huntsville ;  S. Fred Singer , a senior fellow of the Institute and who was founding dean of the School of Environmental and Planetary Sciences at the  University of Miami  and founding director of the National Weather Satellite Service;  Harrison Schmitt , a geologist and former  NASA  astronaut and  Apollo 17  moonwalker; Dr. John Theon, atmospheric scientist and former NASA supervisor; and  Willie Soon Wei-Hock ""Willie"" Soon , a part-time employee of the Solar and Stellar Physics  SSP  Division of the  Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .

Heartland acknowledged that some internal documents had been stolen, The documents included a fundraising plan, board of directors meeting minutes, and the organization's 2012 budget.  Gleick described his actions in obtaining the documents as ""a serious lapse of my own and professional judgment and ethics"" and said that he ""deeply regret[ted his] own actions in this case"".

Sojourners was one of the primary faith organizers of the March 21, 2010, national immigration rally that brought 200,000 people to Washington, D.C. As part of a coalition of evangelical groups, Sojourners came out in full support for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants as part of any immigration reform legislation in the United States on . Wallis stated that it was part of a ""sea change"" in the evangelical community, driven in part by the increasing numbers of immigrants in congregations. He went on to state that evangelical leaders have concluded that ""we don't believe there are second-class images of God, and therefore we don't believe in a second-class status for people who are willing to follow an earned path to citizenship.""     Rejecting LGBT advertising    In 2011 Sojourners' website, sojo.net, rejected a Mother's Day advertisement from Believe Out Loud that featured a same-sex couple.     Countering extremism    Wallis and other faith leaders played an important behind-the-scenes role in preventing the  Quran burning  by pastor  Terry Jones  pastor  Terry Jones  on September 11, 2010. Wallis' opinion piece in '' The Washington Post 's'' ""Sunday Outlook"" section describes the role he and other faith leaders played. Sojourners staff met with White House officials and hand-delivered the letter. InterAction, a coalition of 187 nongovernmental relief and development organizations focused on the world's poorest and most vulnerable people, issued a letter of support for Sojourners' approach.

A separate publication in  Ottawa ,  Ontario , of the same name was published from 1989 to 2004, revived from 2005 to 2008 and began publication again in 2013. This publication was is legally separate entity, although it spawned from the Halifax publication.    Halifax edition   The idea for ''Frank'' can be traced to Halifax-area newspaper publisher  David Bentley  Canadian businessman  David Bentley . Using money he received from the sale of '' The Daily News  Halifax  The Daily News '', Bentley, along with Lyndon Watkins and Dulcie Conrad, started a bi-weekly ""gossip rag"" or ""scandal magazine"" which they gave the name ''Frank''.  The first issue was published in November 1987 and focused on gossip about the private lives of the rich, famous and politically connected in the  Maritimes . It was designed to sell the sensational news coverage that mainstream press in the Maritimes was averse to covering and was somewhat of an extension to Bentley's vision for ''The Daily News'' during the 1970s and early 1980s.  Bentley followed a successful formula with ''Frank'' by feeding the need for sensational gossip among the rich and powerful as well as the average citizen. The publication found its niche in a Canadian media which was traditionally reluctant to pry into the personal lives of politicians and other notables, often covering material found nowhere else. All articles in ''Frank'' are published anonymously although some of its contributors have at times been revealed to be reporters working for more mainstream media outlets.  Unusually, the magazine had no real advertising and operated solely from its subscriptions, although it does contain a great deal of satirical ""advertising"".  Bentley expanded the ''Frank'' franchise to include an  Ottawa  edition in 1989 with the help of former Canadian Press reporter  Michael Bate , while continuing with his publication of the Halifax edition. The Halifax edition of ''Frank'' gained considerable coverage after scooping local and national media to reveal the charges of sexual assault against former  Premier of Nova Scotia  and Trudeau-era cabinet minister  Gerald Regan . Regan was subsequently acquitted. Local targets of the magazines satire and gossip have frequently included members of the billionaire  Frank Sobey Sobey ,  Kenneth Colin Irving Irving  and  McCain Foods McCain  families, as well as prominent local media personalities and politicians in all three provinces.  Dulcie Conrad sold her share of the Halifax edition of ''Frank'' in the mid-1990s to Bentley and Watkins. In September 2000, Bentley and Watkins sold an equity stake in the Maritime edition of ''Frank'' to one of the magazine's reporters, Clifford Boutilier.  From 2002 to 2004, David Bentley's daughter Carolyn Wood was the editor/publisher of the Maritime edition.  In 2004, Wood handed control of the magazine to John Williams, previously a ''Frank'' staff reporter. No money changed hands.  Williams sold ''Frank'' Magazine to Cape Breton-born businessman Douglas Rudderham for an undisclosed sum in November 2010, in order to concentrate efforts on his gay publication, ''Gaze'' Magazine. Based in Montreal, Rudderham is also the president and CEO of Pharmacy Wholesale Services, primarily a supplier of diabetic supplies.  In June 2011 conventional media outlets such as  Canadian Broadcasting Corporation CBC  and '' The Chronicle Herald '' reported that the publication's newsroom underwent a massive shakeup when four of its five reporters left, three having been fired by managing editor Andrew Douglas and one resigning. CBC reported that the first reporter to be fired, Mairin Prentiss, occurred after she had questioned a recent column on  sexism . The firing of Prentiss apparently triggered Walsh's resignation, which was followed by terminations for Neal Ozano and Jacob Boon who allegedly acted insubordinately.    Ottawa edition    Bentley's expansion of the ''Frank'' franchise from its Halifax base to include an  Ottawa  edition in 1989, with the help of  Michael Bate , proved extremely successful during its first decade of publication, as the edition quickly outsold its Maritime cousin by feeding off the void of gossip news among mainstream media in the nation's capital.  Bate subsequently bought out Bentley and his other partners to make the Ottawa edition of ''Frank'' independent of its Halifax roots, although both magazines maintained similar coverage and continued much as before.  Bate did make several changes including adding a ""Remedial Media"" section which printed gossip tidbits on the internal politics of Canadian media outlets.  Michael Coren , whose humour column ""Aesthete's Diary"" was retitled ""Michael Coren's Diary"" after he revealed his true identity, was one of the few contributors ever to use his real name in the magazine.  The final page of the Ottawa edition of ''Frank'' also featured a humour column, usually satirizing the point of view of a real Canadian political figure such as  Sheila Copps  or  Preston Manning . In later years, the back page column was titled ""Dick Little's Canadian Beef""—Little was not a real figure, but simply a curmudgeonly character of mostly conservative views meant to satirize a typical ""angry Canadian.""  Mulroney's father,  Prime Minister of Canada Prime Minister   Brian Mulroney , was incensed and threatened physical harm toward those responsible before joining several women's groups in denouncing the ad as an incitement to  rape —the magazine maintained, however, that it was commenting on Brian Mulroney's perceived habit of using his daughter as a political prop.  The Ottawa edition of ''Frank'' broke a number of notable stories, including being the first to publish the tale of  Mel Lastman 's wife's shoplifting arrest and was the only Canadian publication to cover the divorce trial of cabinet minister  Paul Dick . Other ''Frank'' targets included notorious teen killer  Karla Homolka ,  CBC Radio  host  Peter Gzowski , and comedian  Dan Aykroyd . ''Frank'' continuously followed the marriages of personalities, such as  CBC Television  news anchor  Peter Mansbridge  with fellow journalist  Wendy Mesley  then with actress  Cynthia Dale , and  Bank of Montreal  CEO  Matthew Barrett  banker  Matthew Barrett  with pin-up model Anne Marie Sten. The magazine was also known for  outing  public figures as gay, lesbian or bisexual; most notably, a 1996 cover story on musician  Ashley MacIsaac 's sexuality spurred MacIsaac to come out. Although the magazine settled on the latter case, the legal expenses launched the Ottawa edition into a downward financial spiral.  In 2002 Bate made it known that he was looking for a buyer. A bid was soon on offer by  Theo Caldwell , who had no publishing background and was apparently returning to Canada after a bid to become a Hollywood actor. Caldwell offered $150,000 for the company, and claimed to be interested in making ''Frank'' a ""kinder, gentler"" magazine. Bate rebuffed the offer due to his rejection of Caldwell's vision for the publication. ''Frank'' relaunched as a digital publication on October 1 with a metered  paywall , in a blog format described as similar to  Andrew Sullivan ’s ''The Dish'', with a subscription price between $10–15 per month. It came out in December 2013 and biweekly after that in both digital and print editions.

BGA journalistic investigations are guided by the newly adopted BGA guidelines for investigations and oversight protocols. They work under the motto, ""Shining a Light on Government"".  After Richard Friedman's brief tenure as executive director  1969–71 , J. Terrence Brunner joined the BGA. By this time, the organization had earned a national reputation for its investigations. At this point, the BGA was in need of revitalization. There are now five working units that make up the organization  Investigations, Advocacy, Communications, Watchdog Training, and Reporting and Administration. In the fall of 2010, BGA launched a new website, and it continues to investigate misdeeds. Shaw also introduced a new idea to the non-profit, to propose new policies instead of just exposing problems.     The Citizen Watchdog Training Unit    The Citizen Watchdog Training Unit teaches citizens to monitor and report on their local governments, working with BGA investigators and editors. Trainings take place throughout the state, particularly in underserved communities. They bought a tavern with many building-code violations, so it could document how many city inspectors and  fire marshal <nowiki/>s could be bought off with just $10 bills.  The Mirage only stayed open for about two months. They were concerned that people were beginning to figure out the true reason of why they were there and could not stay in business any longer.    Awards and notable achievements   The BGA and the Center on Wrongful Convictions won the  Edward R. Murrow  Award for the June 2011 investigation into the high cost of wrongful convictions. This was a groundbreaking series documenting the human and financial toll of alleged government and police misconduct that led to 85 people being wrongfully incarcerated for violent crimes they did not commit.  In 2012, three BGA reports were nominated for  Emmy Award Emmys  in the Chicago/Midwest chapter of the  National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences . All three stories were collaborations with  WFLD FOX Chicago  and investigative reporter Dane Placko. ""Tax Dollars Up in Smoke"" was nominated for Outstanding Achievement for News Gathering – Single Investigative Story and Series. ""Globetrotting Principal"" was nominated for Outstanding Achievement for News Specialty – Report/Series, Education/Schools, Feature or Series. ""Nuns vs. Strippers"" was nominated for Outstanding Achievement for News Specialty – Report/Series, Religion, Feature or Series.  The Better Government Association won the Peter J. Lisagor award in 2012 for a series of news articles and broadcasts over the previous year on credit card abuses by government officials in the Chicago area. Robert Herguth and Patrick Rehkamp from the BGA won the multimedia collaboration award.  The BGA was awarded the Eugene S.

White House press credentials    In February 2017, founder Jim Hoft and ''The Gateway Pundit'''s  Lucian Wintrich , a 28-year-old writer and artist, were granted  White House  press credentials. Wintrich has collaborated with  Milo Yiannopoulos , former editor at  Breitbart News . and to alleviate what he sees as bias among reporters in the White House press corps.  In October 2017, ''The Gateway Pundit'' published an article falsely implicating an innocent person as the shooter in the  2017 Las Vegas shooting . The article was promoted by Google as a ""top story"" for searches for his name. In February 2018, ''The Gateway Pundit'' published an article erroneously stating that school shooter  Nikolas Cruz  was a registered Democrat, citing a registered Broward County voter with a similar name. The website later corrected its mistake. The individual in question was however a conservative whose Facebook profile was littered with pro- Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Second Amendment  memes.

In September 2018, after college professor  Christine Blasey Ford  alleged that  U.S. Supreme Court  nominee  Brett Kavanaugh  had sexually assaulted her in the 1980s when they were teenagers, ''The Gateway Pundit'' published an article to be serving jury duty in Washington. The men accused Mueller's office of ""leaking"" the eight year-old ''Post'' story to discredit their allegations. The purported accuser, a Carolyne Cass, did not appear at the press conference, with the men asserting she had panicked in fear of her life and taken a flight to another location. Soon after the press conference, Hoft announced that Gateway Pundit had ""suspended our relationship"" with Wohl.  In August 2013, Hoft contracted a serious strep infection, lost vision in one eye, suffered five strokes, and had 12 hours of open-heart surgery. Three months following his treatment and after learning that he would be losing his health insurance, Hoft stated that it was the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Affordable Care Act  that has caused insurance companies to leave the marketplace in his home state of Missouri.

The current editor is Rebecca Schoenkopf, formerly of '' OC Weekly ''. ''Wonkette'' covers US politics from Washington DC to local schoolboards. Taking a sarcastic tone, the site focuses heavily on humorous breaking news, rumors, and the downfall of the powerful. It also deals with serious matters of politics and policy, producing in-depth analysis.    Launch and history   ''Wonkette'' was established in January 2004 as part of the  Gawker Media  network. Its founding  Editing editor  was  Ana Marie Cox , a former editor at  suck.com .  Cox rapidly established a large reading audience and media notice for the site. The blog gained further national media attention after Cox publicized the story of  Jessica Cutler  aka ""Washingtonienne"", a former  United States Congress Hill  staffer who blogged about her  affair  with a member of former Senator  Mike DeWine 's staff.  Cox announced her resignation as ''Wonkette'''s editor on January 5, 2006, in order to promote her book, ''Dog Days'', and was succeeded by  David Lat , the author of  Underneath Their Robes , a blog about the federal judiciary, and  Alex Pareene , a young  New York University  student and Gawker intern/guest editor in New York who moved to D.C. for the ''Wonkette'' position.  In late 2007, Pareene moved to the flagship  Gawker  site and, in April 2010, to  Salon.com Salon .   In June 2006, Lat announced his decision to leave ''Wonkette''. His slot was to be filled by guest editors until August 2006, when longtime political blogger  Ken Layne  joined as editor. ''Wonkette'' reached its largest pre-2008 audience during the 2006 midterm elections due to scandal coverage of  Mark Foley  and other incumbents involved in corruption, sex-abuse and bribery scandals.  After Pareene and Layne's departure in October 2007, a team of new editors including  John Clarke,&nbsp;Jr. , and  Megan Carpentier  was installed by Gawker management. Gawker publisher  Nick Denton  brought Layne back as sole editor two months later, who put in place the team of  Jim Newell  of  IvyGate , videographer  Liz Glover , former Gawker blogger  Sara K. Smith , Columbia literary magazine '' The Blue and White '' editor  Juli Weiner , and longtime contributors  Princess Sparkle Pony    Peter Huestis   and  Josh Fruhlinger , the  Comics Curmudgeon .  ''Wonkette'' teams covered both the Denver DNC and St.&nbsp;Paul RNC conventions. Newell and columnist Josh Fruhlinger covered  Barack Obama 's inauguration in Washington. As with many political websites, readership hit new records between the November 2008 election and January 2009 inauguration.  Past and current guest editors and contributors include '' Reason Magazine '' editor  Nick Gillespie , '' Washington Post '' reporter  David Weigel ,  DCeiver  editor and '' Huffington Post '' writer  Jason Linkins , Gawker editor and  The Awl  founder  Choire Sicha , New York comedian and author  Sara Benincasa , Chicago artist and journalist  Lauri Apple , '' Boston Globe '' political blogger  Garrett Quinn , cartoonist  Benjamin Frisch , and '' Vanity Fair  magazine  Vanity Fair '' online writer  Juli Weiner .  In April 2011, ''Wonkette'' came under criticism after blogger Jack Stuef wrote a post that was interpreted as mocking  Trig Palin  for his having  Down syndrome .  The post suggested that Trig was possibly the result of incest between  Todd Palin  and  Bristol Palin .  In response, at least 14 advertisers, including major companies such as Ford,  Toyota ,  Verizon ,  Nordstrom , and  Papa John's , adding the feminine ending to best describe founding editor Cox and as a play on the word ""gazette.""     Separation from Gawker Media    On April 14, 2008,  Gawker Media  announced that it was selling ''Wonkette'' and that Layne would remain managing editor and part owner. Gawker Media head Nick Denton attributed the sale to ""hunkering down"" before another dot com downturn and the Internet bubble bursts  ""And, even if not, better safe than sorry; and better too early than too late..."", and it is now supported by reader donations.     Style and frequent targets   ''Wonkette'' makes frequent targets of mainstream media outlets like  CNN , '' The Washington Post '' and '' Politico  newspaper  Politico '', when they are perceived as missing opportunities for substantive political analysis by attempting to get ""scoops"" or simply covering the actions of others in the  mainstream media .

599,1,sandiegofreepress.org,Category Media in San Diego," '''''The San Diego Free Press''''' was an  underground press underground newspaper  founded by philosophy students of  Herbert Marcuse  at the  University of California, San Diego  in November 1968, and published under that title biweekly until December 1969, when it became the weekly ''Street Journal'' starting with its 29th issue. The paper's contents were a mix of radical politics, alternative lifestyles, and the counterculture, reflecting in part Marcuse's  Frankfurt School  Marxist/Freudian ideas of cultural transformation.  Both the ''Free Press'' and its successor the ''Street Journal'' were subjected to arrests by local police, and harassment and spying by the FBI. Break-ins, vandalism, and the fire-bombing of a car owned by the commune were allegedly carried out by paramilitary vigilantes calling themselves the Secret Army Organization  SAO . Police and members of the military Shore Patrol entered the commune and the paper's offices without a warrant, in search of deserters. Street vendors were arrested and the paper's editorial offices were broken into and robbed; in a break-in on Christmas Day 1969, a $4000 typesetting machine was thoroughly wrecked. Subsequent issues were printed from typewritten copy. Several weeks later a fund-raising cocktail party to raise funds for the ''Street Journal'' was raided by police, who arrested Diepersloot for selling alcohol without a license.    Revival    The title ''San Diego Free Press'' was revived as a local leftist alternative paper produced by  Indymedia , starting in 2005. Other than the title it had no other ties to the original ''San Diego Free Press''.  On June 4, 2012 a group, associated with the  OB Rag , including former contributors to the original ''San Diego Free Press''/''Street Journal'', started SanDiegoFreePress.org as a website featuring neighborhood news and progressive viewpoints. Stories are published 7 days a week, including a daily  m-f  news summary and weekly columns covering everything from photographic essays to politics.  SanDiegoFreePress.Org is a volunteer organization made up of citizen journalists, progressives and community activists.  An editorial board oversees daily operations and sets policy.    Notes      Category Media in San Diego ","The San Diego Free Press was an underground newspaper founded by philosophy students of Herbert Marcuse at the University of California, San Diego in November 1968, and published under that title biweekly until December 1969, when it became the weekly Street Journal starting with its 29th issue. The paper's contents were a mix of radical politics, alternative lifestyles, and the counterculture, reflecting in part Marcuse's Frankfurt School Marxist/Freudian ideas of cultural transformation.Founders of the Free Press included Lowell Bergman, later an investigative reporter for 60 Minutes. Members of the staff commune, called The People's Commune, included John Lawrence, Richard Blackburn  ""Black Dick"" , Herman Rumper, and Larry Gottlieb. The Policy Coordinator, who wrote most of the editorials, was Jan Diepersloot, a graduate student in linguistics. The staff lived communally in a 3-story brick house in Hillcrest, and also had a dilapidated rural retreat in Ramona, where marijuana was sometimes grown.Both the Free Press and its successor the Street Journal were subjected to arrests by local police, and harassment and spying by the FBI.

Subsequent issues were printed from typewritten copy. Several weeks later a fund-raising cocktail party to raise funds for the Street Journal was raided by police, who arrested Diepersloot for selling alcohol without a license.The paper made powerful enemies in San Diego by running a series of investigative exposés, largely based on rumor, on the corruption of San Diego's richest and most powerful, including tycoon C. Arnholdt Smith, publisher James S. Copley, and race track owner John Alessio. The paper's close ties to the Movement for a Democratic Military  MDM  was a source of friction with local military bases. It became impossible for the paper to find a willing printer in San Diego and the staff had to go out of town, to Los Angeles or farther afield, to find printers. Financial shortfalls took their toll, and the Street Journal finally published its last issue toward the end of 1970.",Revival Notes,1,1

File CBN_1956_version_2.png thumb right The logo of Chronicle Broadcasting Network  1956-1967 .  The ABS-CBN logo features three main elements, the vertical line rooted on a horizontal origin, the three extending circles, and the text ABS-CBN. The vertical line or bar represents a tower  broadcasting tower  as well as dignifying the company and representing its core business of broadcasting, with the circles symbolizing a transmitter tower's signals, and representing the red, green and blue or  RGB  colors which makes up a  pixel  shown on the  television . The 3 divisions of the Philippines, Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, are also denoted by the three circles, as well as its wide presence, ""range for imagination"", and its ""pioneering, embracing"" spirit.  One unique thing about ABS-CBN's logo is that it also has a horizontal version, usually used to save space as the main vertical logo usually takes up more space than the horizontal one. The design of the horizontal version of the logo contains the ABS-CBN text, split into two parts, ""ABS"" and ""CBN"", without the dash connecting them, and ABS-CBN's iconic symbol squeezed in between them.  The first logo to have a horizontal version going by this design was the logo launched in 1986, the year they re-launched their operations after 14 years of hibernation under martial law and Marcos' authoritarian rule. From 1986 up until 2014, the elements of the horizontal logo, text, and symbol were evenly sized.

The frequency was later awarded to  Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation BBC  as  DWWX-TV  from 1973 to 1986, and had a different logo used. Channel 2 is currently used as the frequency of the flagship station of ABS-CBN in Metro Manila.  ABS-CBN introduced an innovation to the channel 2 logo from 1986 to 1992. At first, the channel 2 logo is introduced into ABS-CBN, after the dissolution of BBC in March. The features of the first channel 2 logo is a wing-shaped blue crest with a white curve at the top and a white line as a tail, the Broadway 2 logo was used from 1986 to 1987. It has a slogan name ''Watch Us Do It Again!'' as the station ID aired since the network's revival.  After six months of carefully selected plans, the first tri-ribbon 2 logo laced with a rhomboidal star came to being on 1 March 1987. The tri-ribbon 2 logo's color is white carried the slogan ''The Star Network'' when it aired as a station ID to reclaim the dominance in TV ratings, using the  Scanimate  system that it took over from the private-owned BBC-2. By 1988, the ribbons in the tri-ribbon 2 logo were changed into red, green and blue stripes from the three white stripes it first used. Truly, the tri-ribbon 2 logo was accidentally coming from a shooting star in the form of the number 2 in the idents which came out. Similarly, most numerical channel logos within this slogan have a star and versions came into regional TV channels like 3   DYCB-TV  in Cebu and  DZRR-TV D-3-ZO-TV  in Baguio , 4   DYXL-TV  in Bacolod and  DXAS-TV  in Davao  and other regional stations. The tri-ribbon 2 was also used on microphone flags until 2000, during the celebration of the New Millennium.     Sarimanok    The  Sarimanok , a legendary bird in Philippine folklore, was first used in 1966 to identify color broadcasts, somewhat similar on how the  NBC logos NBC peacock  has been utilized. In 1993, which happens to be the Chinese Year of the Rooster, ABS-CBN relaunched the Sarimanok with a new station ID featuring the legendary bird. The ''Sarimanok'' ID became utmostly associated with the channel that ABS-CBN opted it to become the station's mascot. ABS-CBN later named its new 24-hour news channel the Sarimanok News Network, the precursor of the  ABS-CBN News Channel . It was revived again in 2004 to promote regional broadcasts nationwide.     Evolution of ABS-CBN logos    The logo of pre-merger Alto Broadcasting System had a symbol composed of a transmitter with a circle denoting its signals, a precursor of sorts to ABS-CBN's current logos. The logo of pre-merger Chronicle Broadcasting Network, on the other hand, had three blocks and the CBN letters in them. In 1961, the ABS-CBN brand was introduced and its first logo had a big letter B, unifying the names ABS and CBN, in a box placed between their channel numbers 3  ABS' DZAQ-TV  and 9  CBN's DZXL-TV .  A modified version of ABS symbol was launched in 1963, composed of a triangle denoting a transmitter tower and four circles denoting its signals  in the same vein as the 1953 logo , enclosed in a rounded box and with the ABS-CBN text above, in a form that would evolve over the years to the present-day logo. The logo soon after took on its current iteration  a vertical line, denoting a transmitter tower, with three concentric circles signifying Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, enclosed in a square frame, in 1967. At that time, it was rendered in black and white because color TV  despite the fact that it was ABS-CBN that introduced it the previous year  wasn't common yet and the logo style at that time separated ABS and CBN's names, putting ABS' name on top and CBN's on the bottom.  The network used a colored variation of the 1967 logo when color television introduced and they re-launched operations in 1986, after 14 years of forced closure under martial law. The logo had the three rings detached from the transmitter and colored the three rings in red, green, and blue, and substituted the square frame with an outlined black box. The RGB-colored logo has remained relatively unchanged since then, though two modifications in 1993  the 40th anniversary of Philippine TV  and 1996  ABS-CBN's 50th corporate anniversary  saw minor tweaks in the letters, the rings and the box.  1 January 2000  the first day of the new millennium  saw a significantly revamped version of the logo. In this version, the outlined black box that enclosed the three rings and the vertical line  that maintained their 1996 design  was replaced by a grey square  a crystal plane when rendered in 3D  and the ABS and CBN names joined together to form ABS-CBN's name, now situated below the symbol. The ABS-CBN letters were also given a completely revamped look.  The present logo, launched in 2014, is a minimally altered version of the 2000 logo, greatly modifying the ""ABS-CBN"" text, dropping the once-standard serifs on the letters, giving the three RGB rings thicker width and perfected concentricity, and adopting a white square instead of a black or grey one. The rebranding aims to maintain the iconic structure of ABS-CBN's logo while at the same time giving it a new look suited for a period of popularity for social and digital media.

It is the Philippines' largest entertainment and media conglomerate in terms of revenue, operating income, net income, assets, equity, market capitalization, and number of employees. ABS-CBN was formed by the merger of Alto Broadcasting System  ABS  and Chronicle Broadcasting Network  CBN . ABS was founded in 1946 by American electronics engineer James Lindenberg as Bolinao Electronics Corporation  BEC . In 1952, BEC was renamed Alto Broadcasting System  ABS , after Judge Antonio Quirino — brother of President Elpidio Quirino, who purchased the company. The company that would later be merged with ABS to form ABS-CBN was founded in 1956 as Chronicle Broadcasting Network  CBN  by newspaper mogul Eugenio Lopez, Sr. and his brother Fernando Lopez, which was then the Vice President of the Philippines. The two companies were merged and incorporated as ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation on 1 February 1967, and renamed ABS-CBN Corporation in 2010 to reflect the company's diversification. The common shares of ABS-CBN were first traded on the Philippine Stock Exchange in July 1992 under the ticker symbol ABS.The group owns and operates the ABS-CBN and ABS-CBN Sports+Action national television networks as well as the Radyo Patrol and My Only Radio regional radio networks. The ABS-CBN television network - in particular, is the largest contributor to the group's revenue, generating about 50 to 60 percent of the group's total annual revenue mainly from selling airtime to advertisers. The remaining revenue is generated from consumer sales, mainly from ABS-CBN Global Ltd., which distributes international television channels such as The Filipino Channel and Myx TV and also from pay TV and broadband internet provider Sky. Other companies which operate under the ABS-CBN group are motion picture company Star Cinema, music recording label Star Music, publishing firm ABS-CBN Publishing, pay TV content provider and distributor Creative Programs, and talent agency Star Magic.

From 1967 until the late 1980s, the magazine featured the writings of authors such as  Thomas Sowell ,  Tom Wolfe ,  P.J. O'Rourke ,  George F. Will ,  Malcolm Gladwell ,  Patrick J. Buchanan , and  Malcolm Muggeridge . During the 1990s, the magazine was better known for its reports on  Bill Clinton  and its "" Arkansas Project ,"" funded by businessman  Richard Mellon Scaife  and the  Bradley Foundation .  For his part, Wattenberg eventually incurred the displeasure of many fellow conservatives when he belatedly admitted that he had killed a story about rumors of Clinton fathering a child out of wedlock as a result of his relationship with a young  African American  woman. Wattenberg actually tracked down a videotape of the woman being interviewed by an unnamed third party who asked her what Wattenberg described as ""softball"" questions, but he never was able to interview her himself.  Wattenberg's rationales for killing the story were that he had no proof that the story was true and that the woman's testimony was unconvincing. He said that she ""seemed like a junkie."" The story was revived in 1999 by  Matt Drudge .  Internal strife eventually led to the departure of long-time publisher  Ronald Burr  after a disagreement with Tyrrell led Burr to call for an independent audit of the magazine's finances. The departure of Burr and several prominent conservative figures from the magazine's board of directors resulted in conservative foundations pulling much of the funding the nonprofit had relied on to pay high salaries to Brock and Tyrrell, as well as to fund  advertising mail#Direct mail marketing direct-mail campaign s needed to keep up the monthly's circulation. Faced with a budget crisis, the magazine, then led by publisher  Terry Eastland , a former spokesman in the  Ronald Reagan Reagan   United States Department of Justice Justice Department , laid off staffers and cut spending significantly.   The magazine also struggled to pay legal bills incurred from an investigation launched against it by the Justice Department for alleged witness tampering in the  Whitewater  controversy  Whitewater investigation .  The Justice Department investigation led to revelations about the "" Arkansas Project ,"" a campaign by businessman  Richard Mellon Scaife  to discredit the Clintons by funding investigative reporting at several conservative media outlets.    2000s   As shortfalls continued,  George Gilder , a longtime supporter of the magazine, who was newly wealthy from an  Internet business , purchased the magazine with the goal of turning it into a profit-making glossy with significant media buzz.  Numerous staff members, demoralized by the ever-looming budget crises, were laid off or departed after  Joshua Gilder  and  Richard Vigilante  took the reins and vowed to reach a new technology- and business-savvy audience. Circulation and budget losses continued and even increased in the Gilder era, and at one point the entire Washington-based staff, other than Tyrrell and executive editor and web site editor  Wladyslaw Pleszczynski , were laid off as operations were moved to  Massachusetts , where the rest of George Gilder's businesses were based. In 2003, George Gilder, who had lost most of his fortune with the bursting of the  Internet stock bubble , sold the magazine for $1 back to Tyrrell and the American Alternative Foundation, the magazine's original owner.  Later, the name of the owner was changed to the American Spectator Foundation. The magazine then moved operations back to the Washington, D.C. area. Later that year, former book publisher  Alfred S. Regnery  became the magazine's publisher. By 2004, circulation hovered at around 50,000.    2010s   In 2013, the magazine reverted to a  Tabloid  newspaper format  tabloid  format, reflecting the roots of the magazine, which was originally published at a large size. For most of the 1990s and all of the 2000s the ''Spectator'' had been published in a traditional  magazine  format.  In 2011, Assistant Editor  Patrick Howley  published a piece detailing his infiltration of a  Washington, D.C.  protest.  In the article, Howley asserts his aim to ""mock and undermine"" the protest against  American Imperialism , and writes in the first person about his experiences protesting at the  National Air and Space Museum . Pleszczynski added that the issue ""was ready for release well over a month ago but for reasons affecting many a print publication these days couldn't be published on actual pages and after considerable delay is now being released in digital form only.""

Some offices were in  Tokyo . The parent organization was given as the  Asia Foundation . In 1971 CIA involvement ended and all responsibilities were transferred to a presidentially appointed  Board for International Broadcasting   BIB . In September 2009, the  111th Congress  amended the International Broadcasting Act to allow a one-year extension of the operation of Radio Free Asia.  RFA broadcasts in nine languages, via  shortwave , satellite transmissions, medium-wave  AM and FM radio , and through the Internet. The first transmission was in  Standard Chinese Mandarin Chinese  and it is RFA's most broadcast language at twelve hours per day. RFA also broadcasts in  Cantonese ,  Tibetan languages Tibetan    Khams Tibetan language Kham ,  Amdo Tibetan Amdo , and  Uke Tibetan Uke  dialects ,  Uyghur language Uyghur ,  Burmese language Burmese ,  Vietnamese language Vietnamese ,  Lao language Lao ,  Khmer language Khmer   to  Cambodia   and  Korean language Korean   to  North Korea  .

Radio Free Asia is formally a private, non-profit corporation.  Three RFA reporters were denied access to China to cover U.S. President  Bill Clinton 's visit in June 1998. The  Chinese embassy in Washington  had initially granted visas to the three but revoked them shortly before President Clinton left Washington en route to  Beijing . The  White House  and  United States Department of State  filed complaints with Chinese authorities over the matter but the reporters ultimately did not make the trip.

""Wherever we feel there is an ideological enemy, we're going to have a Radio Free Something,"" she says. Dalpino said she has reviewed scripts of Radio Free Asia's broadcasts and views the station's reporting as unbalanced. ""They lean very heavily on reports by and about dissidents in exile. It doesn't sound like reporting about what's going on in a country. Often, it reads like a textbook on democracy, which is fine, but even to an American it's rather propagandistic."" Kim Chol-min, third secretary of  North Korea , in statement submitted at the  United Nations , accusing the United States of engaging in ""psychological warfare"" with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea through RFA.

During the court case, evidence given by the camp doctor led ''LM'' to abandon its defence. ITN was awarded damages and costs, estimated to be around £1 million.  hate speech   Frank Furedi, interviewed in ''Spiked'', responded that the stance of ''LM'' and ''Spiked'' springs from the tradition of the "" anti-Stalinist left "". He argued that the reason why many in the left tradition have difficulties in identifying these ideas with the left is that they completely misunderstand the humanist political position of being progressive in terms of human progress, science, rationality and freedom, and yet be completely anti-state   <blockquote>...much of the left in the twentieth century tended to be influenced by Stalinist and Social-Democratic traditions, which means they could not imagine that you could be left-wing and anti-state...so they were confused by us. But that was their fault, not ours. It was a product of their own abandonment of liberty in favour of ideas about state control.

It was founded by political pundit  Tucker Carlson  and  Neil Patel  political advisor  Neil Patel  in 2010.     History    ''The Daily Caller'' was founded by  Tucker Carlson  and  Neil Patel  political advisor  Neil Patel . After raising $3 million in funding from businessman  Foster Friess , the website was launched on January 11, 2010. The organization started with a reporting staff of 21 in its Washington office. It was launched as an alternative to the  Modern liberalism in the United States liberal  '' The Huffington Post '', similarly featuring sections in broad range of subjects beyond politics.  By late 2012, '' The New York Times '' reported that the site had quadrupled its page view and total audience and had become profitable without ever buying an advertisement for itself. The site has an active community, with over 200,000 comments made each month.  Notable figures have commented on ''The Daily Caller''.  Karl Rove  has said that ""''The Daily Caller'' is necessary reading for anyone who wants to be up to speed with what's going on with politics in America.""  Lawrence Kudlow Larry Kudlow  referred to the site as ""one of [his] faves."" Notable contributors include  Ann Coulter .  ''The Daily Caller'' also hosts ''The Mirror'', a blog written by former FishbowlDC editor and '' The Hill  newspaper  The Hill '' columnist Betsy Rothstein. ''The Mirror'' covers  Media in Washington, D.C. media in Washington D.C. , news related to journalism organizations, as well as political and media related gossip. The tagline is, ""Reflections of a self-obsessed city.""  During a January 2010 interview with ''Politico'', Carlson said ''The Daily Caller'' was not going to be tied to his personal political ideologies and that he wanted it to be ""breaking stories of importance"".     Controversies         Climate change denial     ''The Daily Caller'' has published a number of articles that dispute the  Scientific opinion on climate change scientific consensus on climate change .      False prostitution allegations     In March 2013 ''The Daily Caller'' posted interviews with two women claiming that New Jersey  Democratic Party  United States  Democratic  Senator  Bob Menendez  had paid them for sex while he was a guest of a campaign donor. Dominican law enforcement also alleged that the women had been paid to lie about Menendez by an individual claiming to work for ''The Daily Caller''. ''The Daily Caller'' denied this allegation, stating  ""At no point did any money change hands between ''The Daily Caller'' and any sources or individuals connected with this investigation"". Carlson, who also works for Fox, reportedly did not want ''The Daily Caller'' publishing criticism of a firm that employed him. SPLC also said that two other contributors to ''The Daily Caller'' had ties to white nationalist groups. Upon being confronted with his past white supremacist writings, Greer resigned from any affiliation with ''The Daily Caller''. a white supremacist who organized  Unite the Right rally a rally of hundreds of white nationalists in Charlottesville . Munro's interruption of remarks by the president was widely considered a startling breach of etiquette. Editor-in-chief Tucker Carlson defended Munro's heckling, saying ""As a general matter, reporters are there to ask [questions]"" and that he was ""proud"" of Munro.      Stefan Halper     ''The Daily Caller'' was the first news outlet to report on Stefan Halper, a confidential FBI source, and his interactions with Trump campaign advisors  Carter Page  and  George Papadopoulos . Papadopoulos later pleaded guilty to lying to the  Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI  about campaign matters. The organization, a for-profit company, does this by relying on its charity arm, ''The Daily Caller'' News Foundation, to create the majority of its news content.      Imran Awan     ''The Daily Caller'' kept conspiracy theories surrounding  Imran Awan  alive with aggressive coverage. According to ''The Washington Post'', the claims are without evidence. ''The Daily Caller'' apologized for the headline, and changed it. Citing ""current and former"" MMfA employees, ""friends"" of Brock's and a ""prominent liberal"" — none of whom are named — the article characterized MMfA as having ""an atmosphere of tension and paranoia"" and portraying Brock as ""erratic, unstable and disturbing,"" who ""struggles with mental illness,"" in fear of ""right-wing assassins,"" a regular cocaine user and would ""close [local bars] and party till six in the morning.""  Reuters  media critic and libertarian  Jack Shafer , while noting ""I’ve never thought much of Media Matters’ style of watchdogging or Brock’s journalism,"" nevertheless sharply criticized the ''Daily Caller'' piece as ""anonymously sourced crap,"" adding ""Daily Caller is attacking Media Matters with bad journalism and lame propaganda.""   2012 American Legion Fourth Estate Award for ""     Category American political blogs   Category American news websites   Category Internet properties established in 2010   Category Conservatism in the United States   Category Libertarianism in the United States   Category Tea Party movement   Category American conservative websites ","The Daily Caller is a conservative American news and opinion website based in Washington, D.C.

644,1,remnantnewspaper.com,Category Catholic newspapers and magazines in the United States Category Publications established in 1967 Category Traditionalist Catholic newspapers and magazines," ISSN   0274-9726 owners   The Remnant, Inc.  '''''The Remnant''''' is a  Traditionalist Catholic  newspaper published twice a month in the  United States . Although its editors are not affiliated with any particular institute or traditionalist group, the paper is sympathetic to Archbishop  Marcel Lefebvre  and the  Society of St. Pius X . Founded in 1968, it is the oldest Traditionalist Catholic newspaper in the United States. ''The Remnant'' was a result of a dispute between Walter Matt, the editor of ''The Wanderer'' who served the paper for over thirty years'','' and his brother Alphonse Matt. Walter Matt opposed the changes within the Catholic Church after the Second Vatican Council; Alphonse Matt supported them.  Walter Matt left ''The Wanderer'', which was left under the guidance of Alphonse, to start ''The Remnant'' in 1967, two years before the most dramatic changes, those affecting the Mass and celebration of the Sacraments, were instituted. In Walter Matt's words, his ""reaction to what he saw took the form of a Catholic newspaper called ''The Remnant''.""     '''Remnant E-Edition ''' ''The Remnant'' newspaper is also published in electronic format—available to all print subscribers as well as on its own for a reduced rate. The E-Edition is a high fidelity scan of the print edition formatted for reading on one's personal computer,  Amazon Kindle Kindle ,  Barnes & Noble Nook Nook , or other e-reader devices.   '''Remnant Tours'''  For the past thirty years, ''The Remnant'' has hosted and organized tours and  pilgrimage s to the  Holy Land  and throughout Europe.

The Hoover War Library was housed in the  Stanford Library , separate from the general stacks. By 1926, the Hoover War Library was known as the largest library in the world devoted to the Great War. By 1929, it contained 1.4 million items and was becoming too large to house in the Stanford Library. In 1938, the War Library revealed building plans for  Hoover Tower , which was to be its permanent home independent of the Stanford Library system. The tower was completed in 1941, Stanford University's fiftieth anniversary.  In 1960, W. Glenn Campbell was appointed director and substantial budget increases soon led to corresponding increases in acquisitions and related research projects. In particular, the Chinese and Russian collections grew considerably. Despite student unrest in the 1960s, the institution continued to thrive and develop closer relations with Stanford.    W.

It began as a library founded in 1919 by Republican and Stanford alumnus Herbert Hoover, before he became President of the United States. The library, known as the Hoover Institution Library and Archives, houses multiple archives related to Hoover, World War I, World War II, and other world history. According to the 2016 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report  Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, University of Pennsylvania , Hoover is No. 18  of 90  in the ""Top Think Tanks in the United States"".The Hoover Institution is a unit of Stanford University but has its own board of overseers. It is located on the campus.  Its mission statement outlines its basic tenets  representative government, private enterprise, peace, personal freedom, and the safeguards of the American system. The institution is generally described as conservative, although directors and others associated with it assert that the institution is nonpartisan, as its primary goal is to ""promote economic opportunity and prosperity, while securing and safeguarding peace for America and all mankind.""The institution has been a place of scholarship for individuals who previously held high-profile positions in government, such as George Shultz, Condoleezza Rice, Michael Boskin, Edward Lazear, John B. Taylor, Edwin Meese, and Amy Zegart—all Hoover Institution fellows. In 2007, retired U.S. Army General John P. Abizaid, former commander of the U.S. Central Command, was named the Institution's first annual Annenberg Distinguished Visiting Fellow. Former Secretary of Defense General James Mattis served as a research fellow at Hoover before being appointed by the Trump administration.The institution is housed in four buildings on the Stanford campus. The most prominent facility is the landmark Hoover Tower, which is a popular visitor attraction. The tower features an observation deck on the top level that provides visitors with a panoramic view of the Stanford campus and surrounding area. Additionally, the institution has a branch office in the Johnson Center in Washington, DC.",History Members Directors Honorary Fellows Distinguished Fellows Senior Fellows Research Fellows Distinguished Visiting Fellows Media Fellows National Fellows Senior Research Fellows Publications Funding Details See also Footnotes Further reading External links,2,3

The newspaper has offices in London, Paris, Washington, New York, Moscow, Riyadh, Jeddah, Beirut, Cairo, Baghdad, Dubai, Amman, and Damascus, among others.  The newspaper ""is regarded as by far and away the best and most intensely read Arab newspaper"", according to a 1997 article in '' The New York Times ''.    History       Origins  Lebanese daily    The original ''Al-Hayat'' started as a Lebanese daily newspaper. It was founded by  Kamel Mrowa , a  Lebanese Shi'a Muslims Lebanese Shi'a Muslim , in  Beirut  on 28 January 1946  issue no.1 .  He named his daughter, Hayat Mrowa  now Hayat Palumbo, Lady Palumbo , after the newspaper.  In 1966  16 May , as Mrowa checked final proofs for the next day's edition, an assassin walked into ''Al-Hayat''  Beirut offices and shot him to death. Although the assassin's motive was never conclusively determined, investigators linked the shooting to the newspaper's criticism of the Arab nationalist movement. The publication survived 13 bombing attempts before the Lebanese Civil War finally forced it to shut down in 1976. Owing to the newly relaunched newspaper's majority Christian Lebanese and Christian Palestinian management, critics dubbed ''Al-Hayat'' ""a newspaper of minorities in the service of a prince,"" especially after publishing criticisms by  Kurds  and  Shiites  opposed to  Saddam Hussein . The publication was part of an exchange between American intellectuals—including  Samuel P. Huntington ,  Francis Fukuyama , and  Daniel Patrick Moynihan —and counterparts in the Europe and the Middle East over the moral foundation for the Bush administration's war against terrorism, with the first letter entitled ""What We're Fighting For"" published in February 2002 during the U.S. invasion of  Afghanistan . who had written a number of columns criticizing the government for inefficiencies, including a wave of mysterious deaths among camel populations. The article added that-while sources in  Gaza City Gaza  reported the refusal of both  Jordan  and  Egypt  to host the organization— Qatar  had agreed to host its political leadership  though not its military leadership, which the article stated would likely return to Gaza , and that Hamas's political leader  Khaled Mashal  would be departing  Damascus  shortly to take up residence in  Doha . Anonymous Hamas officials cited pressure from the government to take a clear stance against the protests.

Editions       International edition    Al-Hayat was established by its founder Kamel Mroueh in Beirut in January 28, 1946,  25 Safar 1365 H  as an independent international Arabic daily political newspaper. Its publisher reaffirmed those origins on reviving it in 1988, with London as its base. It collects news through a network of correspondents worldwide and is printed in Arab and Western cities linked by satellite to the London offices. Normally 32 pages, it sometimes expands with supplements and special editions.   It was a pioneer among Arabic newspapers in form, mixed news and commentary, professional editing and use of modern communication technology. Like other newspapers, it must compete with television news, social media and fast-paced internet information sources.     Saudi edition     In 2005, Al-Hayat inaugurated a Saudi edition based in Riyadh. Its three daily editions cover local affairs in Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam in addition to international news from the Arab world.      Digital edition     ''Al Hayat'' started a digital service in October 2002, with a web site accessible worldwide. In May 2012, the digital service began serving mobile media, tablets and mobile phones with interactive features.

The site is multilingual, and publishes international current affairs articles written from a Marxist perspective, as well as a large number of historical and theoretical articles. The IMT is active in over 30 countries worldwide.  Woods is editor of the British section's journal ''Socialist Appeal'' and of the IMT website, ''In Defence of Marxism''  Marxist.com .  The IMT manifesto makes demands such as ""the end to privatisation and the abandonment of market economics"", ""the nationalisation of privatised companies without compensation"" and ""the reintroduction of the state monopoly of foreign trade"". in Italy, ''Vonk'' in the Netherlands, ''Fightback'' in Canada, and ''Socialist Appeal'' in Britain.   Its section in France, ''Révolution''  formerly La Riposte , practiced entryism in the  French Communist Party ; in 2008, ''La Riposte'' supported an alternative platform at the PCF party conference which received the support of 15% of voters. This organization's positions have gained the attention of the ''Wall Street Journal'', which interviewed some members as part of an article on 23 June 2015. Several members of the Mexican section were mentioned by name in articles by the Conservative newspaper '' La Razón  Mexico  La Razón ''. These articles took note of these members large role in student struggles at  Instituto Politécnico Nacional , and accused them of being outside agitators linked to the left-wing writer and politician  Paco Ignacio Taibo II . IMT groups across the world pursue this method in their respective Labour Parties  where they exist , some  Communist Party Communist Parties  such as those in  France  and  Italy  and, in some countries, mass populist parties such as the  Pakistan Peoples Party . This work, however, is typically combined with independent work outside these parties and with a strong observance of not liquidating the organisation within them. The IMT's section in the  United States  does not pursue entryism, instead supporting a campaign for a  trade union -backed Labour Party.  The IMT has spread to parts of Latin America, where it now has groups in  Venezuela ,  Peru ,  Argentina ,  Mexico ,  Bolivia ,  Brazil  and  El Salvador . At the end of 2002 it promoted the launching of the solidarity campaign at  Hands Off Venezuela , which is now active in 30 countries and has had resolutions passed within the trade union movements in Britain, Canada, Italy and other countries.  In the first days of March 2009 the International Marxist Tendency organised a Marxist School in Mexico, where revolutionaries from all over North, South and Central America gathered in order to discuss the work done in each country, as well as Marxist ideas and perspectives for the movement. Notably present at one of the Meetings was  Esteban Volkov , grandson of Trotsky Woods's statement has been used to interpret Yousafzai's politics The Iranian section of the IMT also split away over the international's position on Venezuela's friendly relations with the Iranian government and in 2011 launched ''Marxist Revival''  The tendency has been criticised by some left groups for placing too much emphasis on 'abstract' theoretical topics such as Marxism and art, or the class struggles in the Roman Republic.

The paper is owned by PT Bina Media Tenggara, and the head office is in the nation's capital,  Jakarta .  ''The Jakarta Post'' was started as a collaboration between four Indonesian media under the urging of Information Minister  Ali Murtopo  and politician  Jusuf Wanandi . After the first issue was printed on 25 April 1983, it spent several years with minimal advertisements and increasing circulation. After a change in chief editors in 1991, it began to take a more vocal pro-democracy point of view. The paper was one of the few Indonesian English-language dailies to survive the  1997 Asian financial crisis  and currently has a circulation of about 40,000.  ''The Jakarta Post'' also features an online edition and a weekend magazine supplement called J+. The newspaper is targeted at foreigners and educated Indonesians, although the middle-class Indonesian readership has increased. Noted for being a training ground for local and international reporters, ''The Jakarta Post'' has won several awards and been described as being ""Indonesia's leading English-language daily"". ''The Jakarta Post'' is a member of  Asia News Network .    History       Founding and development     File The Jakarta Post logo.svg thumb 200px The former logo of ''The Jakarta Post''. Used until 31 March 2016.  ''The Jakarta Post'' was the brainchild of Information Minister  Ali Murtopo  and politician  Jusuf Wanandi . Murtopo and Wanandi were disappointed at the perceived bias against Indonesia in foreign news sources. At the time, there were two English-language dailies, ''The Indonesia Times'' and ''The Indonesian Observer''. However, due to negative public perception regarding the existing papers they decided to create a new one. In order to ensure credibility, the two agreed to convince a group of competing newspapers  the  Golkar -backed '' Suara Karya '', the Catholic-owned '' Kompas '', the Protestant-owned '' Sinar Harapan '', and the weekly '' Tempo  Indonesia magazine  Tempo ''  to back the nascent paper. It was hoped to become a quality English-language paper, similar to '' The Straits Times '' in  Singapore , the '' Bangkok Post '' in  Thailand , and the '' New Straits Times '' in Malaysia.  After founding PT Bina Media Tenggara to back the paper, Wanandi spent several months contacting influential figures at the targeted newspapers. To receive their cooperation, ''Kompas'' requested a 25 percent share in the new newspaper, for which it would handle the daily business operations, such as printing, circulation, and advertising. ''Tempo'' offered to assist with management in return for a 15 percent share, while  Sabam Siagian  of ''Sinar Harapan'' was hired as the first chief editor, for which ''Sinar Harapan'' received stock. The establishment of the paper was further aided by incoming Information Minister  Harmoko , who received 5 percent interest for his role in acquiring a license. In total, the start-up cost  Indonesian Rupiah Rp . 500 million  US$700,000 at the time .  Muhammad Chudori , a co-founder of ''The Jakarta Post'' who formerly reported for  Antara  news agency  Antara , became the newspaper's first  general manager .  Further details, including the matter of ''Sinar Harapan'' share of stock and the publisher, were decided at a meeting at Wanandi's office in March 1983. The next month, on 25 April, the first edition&nbsp;— totalling eight pages&nbsp;— was published. The first newsroom of the new paper were located in ''Kompas'' former laundry room, a one story warehouse; the first employees had to do the layout by hand, using pica poles as straight edges. During the first few months, the writers translated and recycled previously published stories from Indonesian media, which were later picked up by foreign wire services. Original reporting was rare as the editors at first did not want to deal with the censorship of  Suharto 's  New Order  Indonesia  New Order  government.  During the early years of publication, ''The Jakarta Post'' had difficulty attracting advertisers, to the point that some editions ran without ads. However, circulation increased dramatically, from 8,657 in 1983 to 17,480 in 1988. Although it was originally hoped that the paper would begin to turn a profit within the first three years, the  Early 1980s recession recession in the early 1980s  led to the start-up funds being depleted. Eventually, in 1985 the paper took out an interest-free loan and received Rp. 700 million from its owners. After advertising increased, ''The Jakarta Post'' was able to turn a profit by 1988, and was considered ""one of the most credible newspapers"" in Indonesia.     Activism     Susanto Pudjomartono , former chief editor of ''Tempo'', became ''The Jakarta Post'' second chief editor on 1 August 1991, after Siagian was chosen to be  List of Indonesian Ambassadors to Australia Indonesia's ambassador to Australia .      Editions and other publications       Sunday edition and J+    ''The Jakarta Post'' Sunday edition was launched on 18 September 1994. The Sunday edition included more in-depth stories, as well as entertainment and fiction that would not be published in the weekday editions. As part of cost-cutting measures amid declining print advertising revenue, the Sunday edition ceased publication in April 2016. It was replaced by a lifestyle and culture magazine called ''J+'', which is included with the newspaper's Saturday edition.     Bali Daily    On 9 April 2012 ''The Jakarta Post'' launched ''Bali Daily'', a four-page daily newspaper produced in  Bali , after noting that 4,900 of the flagship paper's subscribers lived on the resort island. ''Bali Daily'' ceased printing in 2014.    Market   ''The Jakarta Post'' is targeted at Indonesian businesspeople, well-educated Indonesians, and foreigners. In 1991, 62 percent of the paper's readers were  expatriates . Under Pudjomartono's leadership, it began targeting more Indonesian readers. , approximately half of its 40,000 readers are middle class Indonesians.   In 1996, ''The Jakarta Post'' faced invigorated competition when media tycoon  Peter F. Gontha Peter Gontha  bought a controlling stake in rival paper ''The Indonesian Observer'' and revamped the publication. ''The Jakarta Globe'' even hired several defectors from ''The Jakarta Post'', paying them higher salaries, and the ''Globe'''s print run was 40,000.    Layout and style   ''The Jakarta Post'' follows a  broadsheet  format. In the beginning, it featured an index on the front page, as well as short offbeat stories under the title ""This Odd World"". The lifestyle section had eight comic strips, and it used more photographs and graphics than was normal for Indonesian publications at that time. The editorials tended to be shorter than their Indonesian counterparts.  ''The Jakarta Post'' uses the  inverted pyramid  journalism  inverted pyramid  style of reporting, with the most important information at the beginning of the article; during the 1980s, many Indonesian papers put the  Lead paragraph lede  further down. Bill Tarrant attributes this to the different writing styles in English and  Indonesian language Indonesian , with English favouring the  active voice  and direct statements, while respectful Indonesian favours the  passive voice  and a circuitous approach. Regarding this topic, Wanandi has said that ""You cannot bullshit in English, like the Javanese way.""    Public opinion   Peter Gelling, of '' The New York Times '', notes that ''The Jakarta Post'' has been considered a ""training ground"" for local reporters, and offers apprenticeship programs. In 2009, six former ''The Jakarta Post'' reporters worked for '' Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg ''. In 2014 ''The Jakarta Post'' was behind ''Kompas'' in terms of online visits.    Awards and recognition   In 2006, the Reporters Union of Indonesia recognised ''The Jakarta Post'' as being one of the Indonesian newspapers that best followed the  journalism ethics and standards ; other papers so recognised were '' Kompas '' and '' Jawa Pos Indo Pos ''. The paper received the Adam Malik Award in January 2009 for their reporting on foreign politics; the coverage was considered accurate and educated, with good analysis. The following year three reporters received the Adiwarta Award from  Sampoerna  for excellent photography in the fields of culture, law, and politics. Another journalist received the Adam Malik Award in 2014 for his writings which assisted the ministry to distribute information regarding foreign policy implementation.

It had a longstanding rivalry with the '' Seattle Post-Intelligencer Post-Intelligencer '' until the latter ceased publication in 2009.    History   ''The Seattle Times'' originated as the '''''Seattle Press-Times''''', a four-page newspaper founded in 1891 with a daily  Newspaper circulation circulation  of 3,500, which  Maine  teacher and attorney  Alden J. Blethen  bought in 1896. This placed the ''Times'' in direct competition with its  Joint Operating Agreement   JOA  partner, the morning '' Seattle Post-Intelligencer ''. In April 2012, investigative reporters Michael Berens and Ken Armstrong won the  Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting  for a series documenting more than 2,000 deaths caused by the state of Washington's use of  methadone  as a recommended painkiller in state-supported care.  The newspaper's Executive Editor at the time of the controversy,  Mike Fancher , issued an apology in the aftermath of the controversial headline. The advertisements in favor of McKenna represent an  USD $ 80,000 independent expenditure, making the newspaper the third largest contributor to his campaign. Hearst sued, arguing that a '' force majeure  clause'' prevented the ''Times'' from claiming losses as reason to end the JOA when they result from extraordinary events  in this case, a seven-week  Strike action strike  by members of the Newspaper Guild . While a district judge ruled in Hearst's favor, the ''Times'' won on appeal, including a unanimous decision from the  state supreme court Washington State Supreme Court  on June 30, 2005.

Malone , who owns a majority of the voting shares.    History       The 1990s    Liberty Media began in 1991 as a  Corporate spin-off spin-off  of  Tele-Communications Inc. TCI , an American  cable television cable-television  group. Peter Barton, hired by TCI's Malone, served as president until retiring in April 1997.  After  United States Department of Justice U.S. Department of Justice  approval that required TCI to sell its 23.5% interest in  Sprint Nextel Sprint Corporation PSC , Malone wanted to start a finance unit similar to  GE Capital , which could start new cable or Internet services. TCI had already planned  digital cable   Cable converter box set-top boxes .  On September 10, 1999, Liberty Media Group renamed TCI Music to Liberty Digital Inc.  NASDAQ symbol  LDIG , with the new company trading on NASDAQ's National Market tier, after Liberty Media traded most of its Internet content, interactive television assets, and rights to provide AT&T's cable systems with interactive services, in addition to cash and notes valued at $150 million, for TCI Music stock.  On December 17, 1999, TCI Satellite Entertainment Inc.  TSAT , based in  Englewood, Colorado Englewood ,  Colorado , announced that Liberty Media was trading its interest in Sprint PCS for $300 million in TCI Satellite  preferred stock . A new company, 90% owned by Liberty Media and 10% owned by TCI Satellite, would combine the satellite-related businesses and take advantage of the growing area of Internet content. Liberty Media president and CEO  Robert R. Bennett  said the deal would benefit stockholders of both companies.     The 2000s    Liberty Media's  Discovery Channel  and QVC continued to do well, but the newer projects had problems and the company's stock price dropped by half. If AT&T agreed to spin off Liberty Media, new deals such as a possible News Corp. purchase of  DirecTV  would be easier because AT&T would no longer require federal approval to complete such deals.  On May 16, 2006, IDT sold its IDT Entertainment division to Liberty Media ""for all of Liberty Media's interests in IDT, $186 million in cash and the assumption of existing indebtedness"". IDT Entertainment's assets and  Starz Entertainment Group 's line of premium television channels combined to produce content for all distribution platforms. On February 12, 2007, the deal was completed with Time Warner wherein Liberty would receive the Atlanta Braves and a group of craft magazines , along with $1 billion in cash in exchange for 60 million shares of Time Warner stock  valued at $1.27 billion as of market close on February 12, 2007 . Liberty announced plans in April 2011 to sell WFRV and WJMN to  Nexstar Media Group Nexstar Broadcasting Group  for $20 million. On March 6, the two companies approved the second part of the deal, with Sirius XM getting $250 million immediately and Liberty receiving 12.5 million shares of preferred stock convertible into a 40% ownership of Sirius XM  common stock .

Sputnik focuses on  global politics  and  economics  and is geared towards a non-Russian audience. and has often been described as a  Russian propaganda  outlet. On 9 December 2013, RIA Novosti was reorganized into a  new Russian international news agency  Rossiya Segodnya . Within Russia itself, however, Rossiya Segodnya continues to operate its Russian language news service under the name RIA Novosti. The  News agency agency  established its  Recording studio radio studio  and bureau in the city and at a  News conference press conference  on 10 August 2016 launched its  Current affairs  news format  current affairs  and  news program me, ''World in Focus''. It is also available on various satellite transponders, including a 24 hour English service audible in North America via the Galaxy-19 satellite. Notable presenters on Radio Sputnik include  Max Keiser  and  Stacy Herbert , who present the weekly economics based talk show ''Double Down''; This came on the heels of a late June 2017 announcement  Center for European Policy Analysis   CEPA , which argues that Sputnik spreads biased information. In the opinion of CEPA, Sputnik invites only a select group of commenting politicians, especially those known for their pro-Russian views.  Alexander Podrabinek , a Russian journalist who works for  Radio France Internationale  The false story was recited by the then- Republican Party  United States  Republican  nominee for  President of the United States president   Donald Trump  at one of his rallies, leading Eichenwald to accuse Trump of rebranding Russian propaganda for his own advantage. However, this has been disputed by '' The Washington Post '', stating that ""It's not that Trump is a  Putin   wikt marionette marionette , it's that he seems to have pulled bad information off a questionable website and presented it on live television to an audience of thousands without skepticism. This is an indictment of his judgment, not of his loyalty."" According to the report, Sputnik News focused on highly negative stories about NATO and the EU, in particular.  On 26 May 2017, journalist  Andrew Feinberg  journalist  Andrew Feinberg , who had been Sputnik's White House Correspondent, announced on Twitter that he would no longer be reporting for the agency, citing pressure from Sputnik's Russian editors to write stories and ask questions at the White House that implied that murdered Democratic National Committee staffer  Seth Rich  was killed in retaliation for leaking documents to WikiLeaks despite the lack of any evidence to support such a conclusion. In an interview with CNN's Brian Stelter, Feinberg also noted that Sputnik management had insisted on approving or dictating questions he would ask at White House press briefings, and wanted him to ask questions that implied that the April 2017 Sarin gas attack in Syria was a hoax, and that Sputnik tried to prevent reporters from having bylines to avoid accountability for falsehoods in stories. In November,  Alphabet Inc. Alphabet  chairman  Eric Schmidt  announced that  Google  will be ""deranking"" stories from RT and Sputnik in response to allegations about election meddling by President Putin's government, provoking an angry response from both publications.  In May 2018, the  PBS Public Broadcasting System 's '' PBS NewsHour NewsHour '' website published an article by  Elizabeth Flock  journalist  Elizabeth Flock  who reported that after immersing herself for a week in Sputnik News and Radio reports she began ""questioning everything...What I found was a stranger picture than I anticipated, one in which I began to understand how persuasive disinformation could be."" According to the article, Stanton told her that ""'They mix real with unreal, use dubious sources...But trying to pin down what he really found problematic...was like pushing a wet noodle.' What he meant is that proving disinformation can be impossibly slippery."" Sputnik falsely reported on 7 December 2016 that Earnest stated sanctions for Russia were on the table related to Syria, falsely quoting Earnest as saying  ""There are a number of things that are to be considered, including some of the financial sanctions that the United States can administer in coordination with our allies. I would definitely not rule that out."" According to ''The Washington Post'', ""many Sputnik hosts profess skepticism that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election,"" in contradiction to the assessment of the US intelligence community.

In June 1934 the ''State Journal'' and the ''Capital Times'' began to work in tandem by offering reduced advertising rates to clients who ran ads in both papers. The deal required the formation of two new corporations  the Wisconsin State Journal Co. and the Capital Times Co., both operating under the name Madison Newspapers. ''State Journal'' associate editor  and later publisher  Don Anderson regarded the agreement as ""a shotgun wedding, conceived through the realization of both parties that we were broke."" The deal did away with many competitive practices, which put the company in danger of violating state and federal anti-trust laws. The Department of Justice investigated the arrangement in 1944, but passed on making charges.  By 1947, Lee Newspaper Syndicate and Evjue's The Capital Times Company, owner of ''The Capital Times,'' shared a need for new presses and larger facilities, along with concerns about rising production and labor costs. They discussed a new partnership that would allow them to share a printing plant, fix prices and combine profits. With both papers always published in the afternoon, one paper would have to move to morning distribution in order for them to share the same press. Since afternoons were then deemed a more profitable time to hit the streets and doorsteps, they agreed that whichever paper moved to mornings would become the sole publisher of a Sunday edition to make up for the predicted loss in circulation.. Setting the tone for later endorsements, the 1944 introduction was an effusive, admiring portrait taking up the better part of an entire page with two pictures and an account from McCarthy himself, trumpeting the ""Tail-Gunner Joe"" myth propagated by McCarthy based on a ""commendation"" he almost certainly forged </blockquote>     The MNI strike    In 1976, Madison Newspapers, Inc. sought to upgrade its technology with the implementation of digital copy editing and typesetting. Without negotiating with the unions, MNI managers ordered the new equipment, and in April 1977 automated typesetting equipment was put into use. Seventeen printers were forced to give up their jobs and the wages of the remaining printers were cut by one third.

Furthermore, it views the  theory of relativity  as promoting  moral relativism ,    Background    File AndrewSchlafly.jpg right thumb Conservapedia founder  Andrew Schlafly   Conservapedia was created in November 2006 by Andrew Schlafly, a  Harvard University Harvard - and  Princeton University Princeton -educated attorney and a homeschool teacher. Regular features on the front page of Conservapedia include links to news articles and blogs that the site's editors consider relevant to conservatism. Many editorial practices of Conservapedia differ from those of Wikipedia. Articles and other content on the site frequently include  criticism of Wikipedia  as well as criticism of its alleged liberal ideology. differ from Wikipedia's editorial policies. Wikipedia's policies include following a neutral point of view Wikipedia co-founder  Jimmy Wales  has raised concerns about the fact that the project is not licensed under the  GNU Free Documentation License   GFDL  or a similar  copyleft  license, stating that ""[p]eople who contribute [to Conservapedia] are giving them full control of the content, which may lead to unpleasant results."" Initially, Schlafly Conservapedia policies encourage its users to choose usernames ""based on [their] real name or initials"", and users that have usernames deemed ""frivolous"" by the admins are blocked; In an analysis in early 2007, science writer  Carl Zimmer  found evidence that much of what appeared to be inaccurate or inadequate information about science and scientific theory could be traced back to an over-reliance on citations from the works of home-schooling textbook author Jay L. Wile. '' New Scientist '', a science magazine, criticized Conservapedia's views on relativity and responded to several of Conservapedia's arguments against it. Similarly, ''New Scientist'' stated at the end of their article that   Another claim is that "" Albert Einstein 's work had nothing to do with the  development of the atomic bomb "", and that Einstein was only a minor contributor to the theory of relativity. from Schlafly personally  ""A liberal  also leftist  is someone who rejects logical and biblical standards, often for self-centered reasons. There are no coherent liberal standards; often a liberal is merely someone who craves attention, and who uses many words to say nothing.""  The Conservapedia entries on former Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  and President  Barack Obama  are critical of their respective subjects. Mark Sabbatini of the '' Juneau Empire '' considered the Conservapedia entry on  Sarah Palin , the Republican vice-presidential candidate for the  United States presidential election, 2008 2008 U.S. presidential election , a ""kinder, gentler"" and ""far shorter and less controversial"" reference for one wishing to learn about Palin in contrast with the corresponding Wikipedia entry, which Sabbatini found to be plagued by disputes over inclusion of potentially controversial details about her life.  The website sometimes adopts a strongly critical stance against figures that it perceives as political or ideological opponents. For instance, in May 2009, '' Vanity Fair  magazine  Vanity Fair '' and '' The Spectator '' reported that Conservapedia's article on atheist  Richard Dawkins  featured a picture of  Adolf Hitler  at the top. The picture has since been moved to a lower position in the article.   Tom Flanagan  political scientist  Tom Flanagan , a conservative professor of political science at the  University of Calgary , has argued that Conservapedia is more about religion, specifically Christianity, than political or social conservatism and that it ""is far more guilty of the crime they're attributing to Wikipedia"" than Wikipedia itself. Author  Damian Thompson  asserts that the purpose of Conservapedia is to ""dress up nonsense as science"". On the satirical news program '' The Daily Show '', comedian  Lewis Black  lampooned its article on homosexuality.  Stephanie Simon of the ''Los Angeles Times'' quoted two Conservapedia editors who commented favorably about Conservapedia.  Conservapedia's use of Wikipedia's format to create a conservative Christian alternative encyclopedia has been mirrored by other sites, such as  GodTube ,  QubeTV  and MyChurch, which adopted the format of the more prominent YouTube and MySpace, respectively. Wales denied Schlafly's claims of liberal bias in Wikipedia.  RationalWiki's self-stated purpose is to analyze and refute ""pseudoscience"", the "" anti-science  movement"", and ""crank ideas"", as well as to conduct ""explorations of  authoritarianism  and  fundamentalism "" and explore ""how these subjects are handled in the media."" Schlafly contacted Lenski to request the data. Lenski explained that the relevant data was in the paper and that Schlafly fundamentally misunderstood it. Schlafly wrote again and requested the raw data.

The website was started in 2006 by American homeschool teacher and attorney Andrew Schlafly, son of the late conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, to counter what he perceived as a liberal bias present in Wikipedia. It uses editorials and a wiki-based system to generate content. Examples of Conservapedia's ideology include its accusations against and strong criticism of former U.S. President Barack Obama – including belief in the ""birther"" conspiracy theory – along with criticisms of atheism, homosexuality, the Democratic Party, evolution, and Wikipedia's alleged liberal bias. Furthermore, it views the theory of relativity as promoting moral relativism, claims there is a proven link between abortion and breast cancer, praises a number of Republican politicians, supports celebrities and artistic works that it believes represent moral standards in line with Christian family values, and accepts fundamentalist Christian doctrines such as Young Earth creationism. Conservapedia's ""Conservative Bible Project"" is a crowd-sourced retranslation of the English-language Bible which Conservapedia claims will be ""free of corruption by liberal untruths"".The site has received negative reactions from the mainstream media, as well as from notable political figures, including commentators and journalists; and has been criticized by liberal and conservative critics alike for bias and inaccuracies.Conservapedia had over 46,000 articles in August 2018.",Background Editorial viewpoints and policies Comparison to Wikipedia Licensing of content Vandalism Other editorial policies Conflict with scientific views Creation Evolution Environmentalism Abortion Relativity Ideology Liberalism Partisan politics Atheism Reception RationalWiki Lenski dialogue Conservative Bible Project See also References External links,1,5

Originally based in  New York City New York , NRGI has opened offices in  London ,  Accra ,  Lima ,  Washington, D.C. ,  Jakarta  and  Dar Es Salaam . Its activities are supervised by a board of directors, with  Ernesto Zedillo  as chair and  Smita Singh  as vice-chair.  Key tools developed in that context include for example the 2017 Resource Governance Index, a map of resource projects, the Natural Resource Charter Benchmarking Framework, or the 2010 Revenue Watch Index.   Domestic foundations for resource governance   1  Resource management should secure the greatest benefit for citizens through an inclusive and comprehensive national strategy, clear legal framework and competent institutions.   2  Resource governance requires decision makers to be accountable to an informed public.   Economic decisions required to manage resources for prosperity   3  The government should encourage efficient exploration and production operations, and allocate rights transparently.   4  Tax regimes and contractual terms should enable the government to realize the full value of its resources consistent with attracting necessary investment, and should be robust to changing circumstances.   5  The government should pursue opportunities for local benefits, and account for, mitigate and offset the environmental and social costs of resource extraction projects.   6  Nationally owned companies should be accountable, with well-defined mandates and an objective of commercial efficiency.   7  The government should invest revenues to achieve optimal and equitable outcomes, for current and future generations.   8  The government should smooth domestic spending of revenues to account for revenue volatility.   9  The government should use revenue as an opportunity to increase the efficiency of public spending at the national and sub-national levels.   10  The government should facilitate private sector investments to diversify the economy and to engage in the extractive industry.   International foundations for resource governance   11  Companies should commit to the highest environmental, social and human rights standards, and to sustainable development.   12  Governments and international organizations should promote an upward harmonization of standards to support sustainable development.     Resource Governance Index     The Resource Governance Index, developed by NRGI, measures the quality of countries' resource governance and ranks them accordingly. The index is constructed by sending a 149-item questionnaire to 150 experts in 81 countries, who research the issues raised in the questionnaire, compile documentation and complete the questionnaire. The quality of the survey data is then assessed by NRGI and enriched by further data on countries ""enabling environments"". Finally, NRGI calculates the index as a composite score out of the    Value realization score;   Revenue management score;   Enabling environment score; with higher scores indicating a better resource governance process.  {  class ""sortable wikitable"" style ""text-align  right"" !rowspan ""2""  Country/territory !colspan ""1""  Assessed sector !colspan ""1""  RGI 2017 score !colspan ""1""  RGI 2017 rank !colspan ""1""  Value realization score !colspan ""1""  Revenue management score !colspan ""1""  Enabling environment score  -

Because the three remaining commercial broadcast networks  ABC, NBC and CBS  had each owned television stations in Chicago by this time, WGN-TV became an independent station by default. Under executive vice president and  general manager  Ward L. Quaal  whose stewardship of the station and programming efforts earned him the  National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences  [NATAS]'s Governors' Award in 1966 and 1987 , the station adopted a general entertainment format that would become typical of other major market independents up through the early 1990s, carrying a mix of  sitcom s and drama series,  feature film s,  animated cartoon cartoons  and  religious broadcasting religious programs  as well as locally produced news,  public affairs  broadcasting  public affairs , music and children's programs. WGN-TV also became more reliant on sports programming, led by its broadcasts of  Chicago Cubs  baseball games as well as other regional collegiate and professional teams. This helped Channel 9 establish itself as a programming alternative to the market's three network-owned stations and as the market's leading independent for much of the next 39 years. After initial struggles due to its carriage of programs that could not accrue viewership sufficient to attract national advertisers, WGN began turning profitable by October 1957. On January 15, 1956, the station moved its transmitter facilities to a  antenna on the fourth floor of the  One Prudential Plaza Prudential Building  on East Randolph Street and Michigan Avenue, and increased its  effective radiated power  from 120 kW to the maximum of 316 kW. On January 4, 1966, New Television Chicago – a joint venture between  Field Communications   which, through parent  Field Enterprises , was a sister property to the ''Tribune''s main newspaper rivals, the '' Chicago Sun-Times '' and the '' Chicago Daily News '', at the time  and local advertising firm Froelich & Friedland – signed on  WFLD   channel 32, now a Fox owned-and-operated station , which would grow to become WGN's strongest independent competitor in the area. On November 9, 1978,  Tulsa, Oklahoma -based satellite carrier  Gemstar-TV Guide International United Video Inc.  uplinked the WGN-TV signal – albeit without the station's consent, a legally permitted move under an exemption regarding ""passive"" carriers in the  compulsory license  statute of the  Copyright Act of 1976 1976 Copyright Act  – to a  Satcom  satellite  Satcom-3  transponder for distribution to cable and  C-band  IEEE  C-band  satellite subscribers throughout the United States. This resulted in WGN-TV joining the ranks of Atlanta independent station WTCG  later WTBS and now  WPCH-TV   to become America's second national "" superstation ,"" independent stations distributed via  communications satellite satellite  to cable providers within their respective regions, or throughout the country. That cable reach would grow over the next several years  the first heaviest concentrations developed in the  Central United States Central U.S.   where WGN's telecasts of Chicago Cubs baseball, Chicago Bulls basketball and ''The Bozo Show'' became highly popular  and gradually expanded to encompass most of the nation. Tribune and station management treated WGN-TV as a ""passive"" superstation, asserting a neutral position over United Video relaying its signal to a national audience and leaving United to handle national promotion of the WGN signal, instead of handling those responsibilities directly; this allowed the station to continue paying for syndicated programming and advertising at local rates rather than those comparable to other national networks.  Until Tribune began relaying the Chicago feed to the firm directly in 1985, were they compensated directly by United Video for their retransmission or promotion of WGN's signal; Tribune, however, received  royalty payment royalties  from cable systems for programs to which it held the copyright.  As such, WGN-TV became the first Tribune-owned independent station to be distributed to a national pay television audience  United Video would later uplink WPIX in May 1984,  -   9.1     1080i      16 9     WGN-DT    Main WGN-TV programming   Independent station  North America  Independent    -   9.2    rowspan ""3""  480i     rowspan ""2""  4 3     Antenna     Antenna TV   -   9.3    THIS     This TV   -   9.4      16 9     TBD     TBD  TV network  TBD   -  }     Analog-to-digital transition    WGN-TV began transmitting a  digital terrestrial television digital television  signal on UHF channel 19 on January 4, 2001, operating from a transmitter located  atop the  Willis Tower Sears Tower .  Incidentally, WGN-TV was one of six, originally eight, Chicago television stations that declined offers to move their analog transmitters to the Sears Tower antenna farm ahead of the building's 1973 completion.   Channel 9 formerly served as the  Muscular Dystrophy Association   MDA 's  MDA Show of Strength#Love Network Love Network  station for Chicago, carrying the charity's  MDA Show of Strength annual telethon  on  Labor Day  and the preceding Sunday night each September from 1973 to 2012  in its original 21½-hour format that existed until 2010, the six-hour evening format used in 2011 and the three-hour prime-time-only format used in 2012 . For most of its run on the station  except in 1994, due to the  1994 Major League Baseball strike Major League Baseball strike  that year , WGN would preempt portions of the telethon on Labor Day to carry Chicago Cubs or White Sox games held during the afternoon of the holiday. Through its national distribution, beginning with the 1979 event, donations to the WGN-produced local segments of the telethon were also pledged by viewers in other parts of the United States and Canada. The broadcast moved from syndication to ABC in September 2013  by then reduced to a two-hour special , airing thereafter by association on WLS-TV until the final telecast of the retitled ''MDA Show of Strength'' in August 2014. Currently hosted by Lourdes Duarte  who also co-anchors the 4 00&nbsp;p.m. hour of the ''WGN Evening News'' , it features topical discussions, interviews and feature segments focusing on Chicago's Hispanic community and culture.  ''Backstory with Larry Potash'' is a series of half-hour historical specials that premiered on October 18, 2018. Hosted by ''WGN Morning News'' anchor/assignment reporter Larry Potash, the program looks at interesting stories pertaning to history, culture, religion and science within and outside of Chicago. Currently hosted by Micah Materre  who also serves as weeknight co-anchor of the ''WGN Evening News'' and the 9 00 and 10 00&nbsp;p.m. newscasts , the program community events and topical discussions focusing on the African-American community.  ''S.E.E. Chicago'' is a half-hour tourism-based entertainment program  airing Sunday nights at 10 30&nbsp;p.m.  that debuted in 2017. Hosted by Dawn Jackson Blatner, the program showcases the best shopping, entertainment and events in Chicago and its suburbs.  ''Weekend Workbench'', which airs Saturdays at 9 30&nbsp;a.m. and premiered in September 2013, is a weekly home improvement show in which host Ryan Salzwedel guides viewers on home repair tips with the help of Chicago-area with DIY experts.  Channel 9 became known for its heavy schedule of local programs during the period from the 1950s through the 1980s, including some influential programs   '' The Bozo Show '', a long-running children's program that aired under various titles and formats – including as ''Bozo''  1960–1961 , ''Bozo's Circus''  1961–1980  and ''The Bozo Super Sunday Show''  1994–2001  as well as the short-lived prime time spin-off ''Big Top''  1965–1967  – from June 20, 1960 until July 14, 2001. The program was WGN-TV's most successful local program in terms of both ratings and cultural impact, and became the most well-known iteration of the '' Bozo the Clown Bozo '' franchise partly as a result of the exposure it received after WGN became a national superstation in 1978. ''Bozo'' originated as a live, half-hour midday broadcast  expanding to a full hour in September 1961  featuring comedy sketches, circus acts, cartoon shorts and in-studio games. As host, Thomas also was responsible for selecting the program's featured film titles and edited them to remove certain scenes he deemed unfit for family viewing;  Roy Leonard  took over hosting duties following Thomas's death in April 1985 from complications tied to a  stroke , and remained in that role until ''Family Classics'' ended its initial run.  After airing weekly throughout the fall-to-spring television season – first on Friday nights until 1986, and then on Sunday afternoons thereafter – for most of its run, the program began airing sporadically during the  Christmas and holiday season holiday season  in November 1993.  ''Family Classics'' was revived as an occasional series on December 8, 2017, with longtime entertainment reporter  Dean Richards  reporter  Dean Richards  as host.  ''Issues Unlimited'', a Sunday morning public affairs program moderated by ''Chicago Bulletin'' editor and columnist Hurley Green, Sr. from 1971 to 1987; the program featured a panel of local media representatives interviewing local and national newsmakers. the Chicago St. Patrick's Day Parade  which aired from 1949 to 2002 , the  Chicago Auto Show   from 1952 to 1992 and again since 1999  '' U.S. Farm Report ''  which originated from the Bradley Place facility from the agriculture program's national syndication debut in 1975 until production moved to  South Bend, Indiana  after Farm Bureau Journal's production unit assumed distribution rights from the defunct Tribune Entertainment in 2008 , and '' At the Movies  1982–1990 TV series  At the Movies ''  which was produced from the facility from 1982 until 1990, three years after  Gene Siskel  and  Roger Ebert  left the program amid a 1986 contract dispute with Tribune Entertainment to develop '' At the Movies  1986 TV program  Siskel & Ebert & the Movies '' with  Disney–ABC Home Entertainment and Television Distribution Buena Vista Television , which was produced out of WLS-TV's North State Street studios .     Lottery    WGN-TV served as the originating station for the  Illinois Lottery  beginning at its July 1974 inception. Live drawings initially aired as a half-hour Thursday night broadcast  then hosted by Ray Rayner  held at its Bradley Place studios. Channel 9 shared the drawing rights with WSNS-TV from March to May 1975 and again from September 1975 until August 1977, when WGN gained exclusivity over the telecasts. With the introduction of the Daily Game  now Pick 3  in February 1980, drawings began airing on the station at 6 57&nbsp;p.m. nightly. The WGN-TV weather staff also provides local weather updates for WGN Radio under an agreement that began on October 13, 2008, at the conclusion of  The Weather Channel 's ten-year content partnership with the radio station. From 1948 to 1965, WGN also produced an additional 15-minute-long newscast at 6 30&nbsp;p.m., with Austin Kiplinger  to be replaced by Allen in 1953 and then by  Lloyd Pettit  in 1956  reading the news summary and Frann Weigel as the weather anchor; the program was expanded to a half-hour in September 1955, when ''Newsreel'' was discontinued in favor of an amended sports news segment  anchored originally by  Vince Lloyd  . Under Allen's leadership, WGN-TV's newscasts evolved from a ""police blotter/fire alarm-type of news operation"" to incorporating more in-depth and investigative reports. WGN-TV also was the first Chicago television station to televise a local appearance by a  President of the United States U.S. President   carrying  Harry S. Truman 's 1948 visit to Chicago  and provided mobile coverage of Gen.  Douglas MacArthur 's visit to the city  in April 1951 ; it has also provided coverage of the Republican and Democratic presidential conventions each election cycle since 1952, and provided extensive pool coverage of  Pope John Paul II 's Mass at  Grant Park  Chicago  Grant Park  in 1979.   In September 1951, Channel 9 began carrying a 15-minute late night edition of ''Chicagoland Newsreel'' that followed its late evening movie presentations  which began at 10 00&nbsp;p.m. at the time . By 1967, the program had evolved into ''Night Beat'', a 30-minute overnight newscast that – until it was discontinued in 1983 – featured the main anchor  which had included, among others, Greyson, McNeeley, Cliff Mercer and  Jack Taylor  journalist  Jack Taylor   presenting a summary of local and world news headlines as well as a brief weather forecast summary. In February 1955, the station installed a coaxial cable link from the city room of the ''Chicago Tribune''  originally done for the early newscast, ''First Edition'', which aired from 1954 to 1956  to allow ''Tribune'' reporters and contributors to provide information on developing stories being covered by the newspaper and the WGN news department. In October 1999, freelance reporter Jane Boal made headlines when she was hit from behind while trying to move away from a car attempting to drive away from an accident with another vehicle during a live midday report about a carbon monoxide leak that forced the evacuaton of a school in the Rogers Park neighborhood; Boal  who was laid off by the station in May 2009  suffered cartilage and ligament injuries to both of her legs after being pinned between the car involved in the accident and a WGN live truck, but was able to resume work in early November. The weekday editions of the newscast were later expanded to include a second hour  starting at 4 00&nbsp;p.m.  on September 8, 2014, and then to three hours  extending it to the 6 00&nbsp;p.m. hour  on April 4, 2017.  The superstation feed did not clear any of the expanded newscasts up until the conversion of WGN America into a conventional cable channel.

As with concept progenitor WTBS in Atlanta, WGN-TV was a pioneering superstation, becoming the second U.S. television station to be made available via satellite transmission to cable and direct-broadcast satellite subscribers nationwide on November 8, 1978. The former ""superstation"" feed, WGN America, was converted by Tribune into a conventional basic cable network in December 2014, at which time it removed all WGN-TV-produced local programs from its schedule and began to be carried on cable providers within the Chicago market  including Xfinity, U-verse, WOW! and RCN  alongside its existing local carriage on satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network. Although the Chicago station is no longer available within the United States on conventional pay television providers outside of its home market, WGN-TV continues to be available domestically via Channel Master's LinearTV service and as a de facto superstation on most Canadian cable and satellite providers.",History Early years  1948–1956  Independence  1956–1995  Expansion into a national superstation  1978–1990  WB affiliation  1995–2006  CW affiliation; split of the local and national signals  2006–2016  Return to independence  2016–present  Aborted sale to Sinclair Broadcast Group; pending sale to Nexstar Media Group Subchannel history WGN-DT2 WGN-DT3 WGN-DT4 Digital television Digital channels Analog-to-digital transition Programming Locally produced programs Lottery Sports programming News operation News department history News team Notable current on-air staff Notable former on-air staff Canadian distribution References External links,1,1

Category Webarchive template wayback links"," '''Global Integrity''' is an independent,  nonprofit organization  tracking governance and corruption trends around the world using local teams of researchers and journalists to monitor openness and accountability. Global Integrity's reporting has been cited by over 50 newspapers worldwide, The resulting data allows policymakers, private industry, non-governmental organizations and the general public to identify specific strengths and weaknesses in various countries' governmental institutions. In 2007, Global Integrity was recognized by  Ashoka  Innovators for the Public , a network of  social entrepreneur s, with an award for innovation in fighting corruption. Global Integrity also publishes a  blog , ""The Global Integrity Commons"".     2001     In 2001, the organization released a three-country pilot report.     April 2004     '''25-nation field test '''  Global Integrity's 2004 report – tracking the extent of openness, accountability and governance in 25 countries – took more than two years to produce; its team included approximately 200 researchers, editors, Web designers, social scientists, journalists, methodology experts and peer-review panelists. It was the largest project the Center had undertaken to date.  Local teams of social scientists, journalists and analysts in each country collected and reviewed data for 80 Integrity Indicators, divided over six broad categories. The Integrity Indicators allowed Center researchers to quantify each country's responses into a Public Integrity Index. This was a unique scorecard of governance practice that measured the existence of mechanisms  including laws and institutions  that promote public accountability and limit corruption; the effectiveness of these mechanisms; and the access that citizens have to public information to hold their government accountable. For each country the Report included basic country facts; a corruption timeline chronicling significant corruption-related events over the past 10–15 years; an essay on the culture of that country's corruption by an investigative reporter; and a report  compiled by a social scientist  highlighting the main features of the six main categories tracked by the Integrity Indicators.  '''Key findings '''    None of the 25 countries featured in the report  including the United States  received a ""very strong"" ranking – the highest score – on the Public Integrity Index   18 countries had no laws to protect  whistleblower s from recrimination or other negative consequences   In 15 countries, journalists investigating corruption had been imprisoned, physically harmed or killed   In three countries   Guatemala ,  Mexico  and  Zimbabwe  , both journalists and judges had been physically harmed in the previous year   14 countries did not allow their head of state to be prosecuted for corruption   In seven countries, the top  Executive  government  executive-branch official  was not required to file a personal financial- disclosure form revealing their private interests     January 2007     '''2006 Country Reports '''  In 2006, Global Integrity undertook its second major round of fieldwork, using journalistic reporting and data gathering in 43 countries  including 15 featured in the 2004 report  – primarily large aid recipients and  emerging markets . Global Integrity's 2006 report followed the same basic framework as the one for 2004. A team of 220 journalists and researchers applied a slightly modified assessment methodology to generate a new Public Integrity Index. Along with the Integrity Indicators, each country report featured country facts, a corruption timeline and a corruption-themed essay written by a journalist.  '''Key Findings '''    Political financing was the number-one anti-corruption challenge facing the 2006 group of countries   Weak legislative accountability threatened to undermine other crucially-needed long-term anti-corruption reforms   Vietnam, one of Asia's leading emerging markets, was assessed as having the second-weakest overall anti-corruption framework of the group   Russia appeared to have made little progress in establishing and enforcing effective anti-corruption mechanisms, compared with several other  post-Soviet states    Promoting effective anti-corruption and  good governance  programs in post-conflict Africa requires a long-term commitment   New  Member state of the European Union European Union  EU  members   Romania  and  Bulgaria  displayed a moderate gap in overall anti-corruption mechanisms, with Romania exceeding the performance of Bulgaria   Whistleblower protections and weak  or non-existent  access to information mechanisms threaten government accountability in almost every country     2011 Report     '''2011 Country Reports '''  The organization has released a 2011 report detailing 33 countries' levels of corruption.  {  class ""wikitable""  - !

Marcy and his followers split from the SWP in 1958 over a series of long-standing differences, among them their support for Henry A. Wallace's Progressive Party in 1948, the positive view they held of the Chinese Revolution led by Mao Zedong and their defense of the 1956 Soviet intervention in Hungary, all of which the SWP opposed. The WWP describes itself as a party that has since its founding ""supported the struggles of all oppressed peoples"". It has recognized the right of nations to self-determination, including the nationally oppressed peoples inside the United States. It supports affirmative action as necessary in the fight for equality and it opposes all forms of racism and religious bigotry. The WWP and its affiliate Youth Against War and Fascism  YAWF  were noted for their consistent defense of the Black Panthers, the Weather Underground, the Vietnam Veterans Against the War and the Puerto Rican Independence movement.

Business model   In April 2016, Mendoza said in ''Free & Fearless''  a magazine produced by  Hacked Off   that  <blockquote>we are attracting an audience of 3.5 million unique users per month. On top of this  every two hours, 24 hours a day, seven days a week – someone becomes a paid subscriber of ''The Canary'' ... Our growing traffic is attracting advertisers who are now offering us a floor RPM  payment per 1,000 hits  of £3 and a ceiling of £9.""  The website explains its business model  ""Each writer and section editor is paid in two ways. Firstly, each and every article receives a flat-rate equal payment from our monthly income from supporters. So with each new supporter, the pay per article goes up for everyone every month. Secondly, each article receives a top-up payment based directly on the percentage of web traffic, and therefore advertising income, that articles generate during a given calendar month."" ''The Canary'' had a turnover of £250,000/year in 2016, according to Mendoza. According to the 2017/18 annual report from IMPRESS, they had received 58 complaints about The Canary's news reporting, two of which were upheld. In a video posted on  Twitter  in November 2018, The Canary insisted that ""in the last 3 years, we've published more than 9,000 unique articles"" and that ""the number of significant mistakes can be counted on one hand"". Mendoza has said ""We are human beings and we make mistakes. We clean up the mess and make sure it’s clear to our readership"".</blockquote>  ''The Canary'' is generally supportive of  Jeremy Corbyn , the leader of the  Labour Party  UK  Labour Party , but has also supported  Natalie Bennett   former leader of the  Green Party of England and Wales Green Party   and the Greens' ""radical alternative"" to the ""Tory-lite"" policies of ""the  neoliberal  Labour Party"" asserting ""The Green Party's rise to viability preceded the election of Jeremy Corbyn"" and the emergence of  Momentum  organisation  Momentum .

The campaign was supported by antisemitism campaigner  Rachel Riley  and promoted by  Jewish News  and  Nick Cohen . It has led  Macmillan Cancer Support , amongst others,  to suspend advertising on the website while it reviewed online ad placement. A  whistleblower  contacted the website with allegations of telephone  push polling , claiming that people acting for the Conservative Party also paid telephone companies to conduct misleading surveys on voters which were biased in favour of the Conservatives, thus breaking election law in regard to the private polling they are allowed to do during campaigns. ''The Canary'' article This criticism was widely mocked on social media by both supporters and opponents of Jeremy Corbyn. Brooker jokingly said to the author beforehand that ""We originally planned a 25min pro-Corbyn musical number but our shadowy Blairite handlers insisted we scrap it"". particularly following the on-air resignation of Labour MP  Stephen Doughty , and promoted a petition hosted by  38 Degrees   which was later taken down  which called for her resignation.

Founded in 1982, it is one of the nation's most influential legal organizations.In January 2019, The Washington Post Magazine wrote that the Federalist Society had reached an ""unprecedented peak of power and influence."" Of the nine members of the Supreme Court of the United States, five  Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, and Samuel Alito  are current or former members of the organization. Politico Magazine wrote that the Federalist Society ""has become one of the most influential legal organizations in history—not only shaping law students' thinking but changing American society itself by deliberately, diligently shifting the country's judiciary to the right.""The organization, whose ideals include ""checking federal power, protecting individual liberty and interpreting the Constitution according to its original meaning"", plays a central role in networking and mentoring young conservative lawyers. According to Amanda Hollis-Brusky, the author of Ideas with Consequences  The Federalist Society and the Conservative Counterrevolution, the Federalist Society ""has evolved into the de facto gatekeeper for right-of-center lawyers aspiring to government jobs and federal judgeships under Republican presidents."" According to William & Mary Law School professor Neil Devins and Ohio State University professor Lawrence Baum, the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush ""aimed to nominate conservative judges, and membership in the Federalist Society was a proxy for adherence to conservative ideology."" The Federalist Society has played a key role in suggesting judicial nominees to President Donald Trump; it vetted President Trump's list of potential U.S. Supreme Court nominees and, as of January 2019, 25 out of 30 of President Trump's appellate court nominees were current or former members of the society.The society is a membership organization that features a student division, a lawyers division, and a faculty division. The society currently has chapters at more than 200 United States law schools. The lawyers division comprises more than 70,000 practicing attorneys  organized as ""lawyers chapters"" and ""practice groups"" within the division  in ninety cities. The society is headquartered in Washington, D.C. Through speaking events, lectures, and other activities, it provides a forum for legal experts of opposing views to interact with members of the legal profession, the judiciary, and the legal academy.",Founding Background Methods and influence Judicial philosophy Legal activities of members <i>King v.

A proponent of the  Men's Rights Movement , or ""Men's Human Rights Activism"", it is the largest and most influential men's rights website. Its editorial position is strongly  Antifeminism antifeminist  and frequently accuses feminists of being  Misandry misandrist .     About    A Voice for Men hosts radio shows, has a forum and posts articles on its website. It occasionally features groups. AVFM's staff members and contributors are unpaid volunteers with the exception of the founder. The site also accepts financial donations. Elam says ""every dollar goes right in my pocket,"" but is used to advance the group's cause.     Activities    In early 2011, AVFM created the website Register-Her, a  wiki  page which initially  Doxing listed  the names, addresses and other personal information of women convicted of murdering or raping men. The registry expanded over time to include women considered by the sites operators to be guilty of 'false rape accusations' or 'anti-male bigotry'. Under the motto ""Why are these women not in jail?"", the site also published personally identifying information of women who participated in protests against the men's rights movement  MRM , mocked the MRM on social media, or women who voiced feminist supportive ideas. AVFM founder Paul Elam stated that there would no longer be ""any place to hide on the internet"" for ""lying bitches"". AVFM's White Ribbon site was initially established as a response to the White Ribbon Campaign, arguing that  women's shelter s were ""hotbeds of gender hatred"" and that ""corrupt academics"" had conspired to conceal violence against men. The website was harshly criticized by Todd Minerson, Executive Director of White Ribbon, who stated that the AVFM White Ribbon website is a ""misguided attempt to discredit others"" and urged its supporters ""not to be fooled by this copycat campaign"".  AVFM individuals assisted in setting up the first International Conference on Men's Issues, which was held in  Detroit , Michigan in late June 2014. At the gathering attended by a few hundred men, and a few women, However, in early November 2017 the club cancelled the intended use of their facilities saying that they had been ""misled at the time of booking"". Mike Buchanan, the leader of J4MB, had initially said he still intended for the conference to go ahead at St Andrew's as he felt he had ""a perfectly good and legally binding contract"". The conference was instead held at the  ExCeL London ExCeL, London  between July 20 and 22, 2018.     Criticism     AVFM was included in a list of twelve websites in the spring 2012 issue  ""The Year in Hate and Extremism""  of the  Southern Poverty Law Center 's  SPLC  ''Intelligence Report'' in a section called ""Misogyny  The Sites"". The issue outlined the ""manosphere"", describing it as ""hundreds of websites, blogs and forums dedicated to savaging feminists in particular and women...in general"".  Later that year, the SPLC published a statement about the reactions to their report, saying it ""provoked a tremendous response among men's rights activists  MRAs  and their sympathizers"", and that ""[i]t should be mentioned that the SPLC did not label MRAs as members of a hate movement; nor did our article claim that the grievances they air on their websites – false rape accusations, ruinous divorce settlements and the like – are all without merit. But we did call out specific examples of misogyny and the threat, overt or implicit, of violence"".  A 2014 statement by the SPLC criticized the International Conference on Men's Issues, particularly finding fault with the citations made that ""40% to 50% of rape allegations are false"" since the SPLC views that ""the best scholarly studies show that between about 2% and 8% of such allegations are actually false— a rate that is comparable for false allegations of most other violent crimes."" However, the organization's statement also argued that the AVFM-associated conference was ""relatively subdued"" given that most of those there worked to keep ""vitriol to a minimum"" in the discussions. A commentary on the nature of  grief  for men received praise from the SPLC, but the organization cautioned that the nature of prior material stated by those in AVFM was still a severe problem.  Jaclyn Friedman ,  Jill Filipovic ,  Clementine Ford  writer  Clementine Ford , and Mark Potok of the  Southern Poverty Law Center SPLC . '' Time  magazine  Time '' has reported on SPLC's ""misogynist"" description of the group as well as on the movement's official disavowing the concept of misogyny, with Elam cited as stating that being controversial was a way of drawing attention. Journalist Jessica Roy remarked that she found the AVFM conference divided between many individuals making violent threats and laughing openly at jokes about rape, and many individuals seeking to promote socioeconomic and legal changes by polite discussion.

Together they saw the possibility of developing an economic journal for the Hong Kong public in the early 1970s  although some sources have suggested that it was  Lok Yau-Mui   駱友梅 , his wife, and not Law Chi-Ping who was the true co-founder  and the newspaper was first published on 3 July 1973.  Shortly after the publication of newspaper, the Hong Kong stock market experienced the first significant historical fall as a result of the  1973 oil crisis . Nonetheless, the Hong Kong economy had recovered by 1976 and the newspaper eventually became one of the most influential newspapers in the Chinese media world.  In Sep 2006, a new shareholder  Clermont Media Limited, a BVI company  acquired the majority shareholding of the company.  Today, Chief Editor of the newspaper is  Alice Kwok Yim-Ming  郭艷明.

In 1998, the publication was folded into the new National Post, although the name Financial Post has been retained as the banner for that paper's business section and also lives on in the Post’s monthly business magazine, Financial Post Business. The Financial Post started publication in 1907 by John Bayne Maclean. It was a weekly publication, and one of the core assets of Maclean's media business, which eventually became Maclean-Hunter.The paper was purchased by Sun Media in 1987, and expanded into a daily tabloid and home delivery newspaper in 1990 with a reformatted Financial Post Magazine following shortly after. In 1998, Sun Media sold the Financial Post to Hollinger, whose CEO Conrad Black had been seeking a way to establish a national newspaper. Sun Media acquired the Kitchener-Waterloo Record, the Guelph Mercury, the Hamilton Spectator and the Cambridge Reporter from Hollinger in exchange, but has since sold all four papers. The Hollinger transaction was finalized in July 1998. Originally slated to launch on October 5, 1998, the National Post's launch was delayed until October 27 by the financial complications of the Financial Post purchase.The Financial Post retains a loyal audience of English business readers in Canada, offering coverage similar to the Report on Business by The Globe and Mail. Though there has been frequent speculation that the Financial Post would be merged into the business sections of the regional newspapers owned by the National Post’s parent, Postmedia News, much of the Post’s editorial content is now syndicated to other Postmedia newspapers through the Postmedia News Service. The Financial Post publishes several popular editorial features throughout the year, including the annual competition Financial Post’s Ten Best Companies to Work For. Editors of the paper included Floyd Chalmers, John Godfrey and Diane Francis, who was the paper's last editor prior to the launch of the National Post.",References External links,0,0

'' Naked Came the Stranger '' is a 1969 novel written as a literary hoax poking fun at contemporary American culture. Although credited to ""Penelope Ashe"", it was in fact written by a group of twenty-four journalists led by ''Newsday'' columnist Mike McGrady. McGrady's intention was to write a deliberately terrible book with a lot of sex, to illustrate the point that popular American literary culture had become mindlessly vulgar. The book fulfilled the authors' expectations and became a bestseller in 1969; they revealed the hoax later that year, further spurring the book's popularity.

It originated during the Seattle  WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity anti-WTO protests worldwide in 1999  and remains closely associated with the  global justice movement , which criticizes  Neoliberalism neo-liberalism  and its associated institutions. Several local branches of the network have been raided by law enforcement over the years.    Aims   According to the  umbrella organization umbrella  homepage, ""Indymedia is a collective of independent media organizations and hundreds of journalists offering grassroots, non-corporate coverage."" Most obviously, the rise of corporate social media sites and the massification of 'open publishing' appropriated Indymedia's key innovations for the cultural industry.  In February 2013, Ceasefire magazine noted a decline in the use of Nottingham Indymedia, stating that activist use of commercial social media had increased. The police claimed that the poster broke the law by ""incitement to criminal damage"", and sought access logs from the server operators. Despite being warned by lawyers that the servers were ""journalistic equipment"" and subject to special laws,      Bristol server seizure 2014     In August 2014, Bristol Indymedia's servers were seized by police after arsonists used the site to claim responsibility for a fire at firearms training centre.   On August 15, 2000, the  Los Angeles Police Department  temporarily shut down the satellite uplink and production studio of the Los Angeles Independent Media Center on its first night of  Democratic National Convention  coverage, claiming explosives were in a van in the adjacent parking lot. No reasons were given at first by the FBI and Rackspace for the seizure, in particular IMC was not informed. Rackspace claimed that it was banned from giving further information about the incident. stated that the company had been forced to comply with a court order under the procedures laid out by the  Mutual legal assistance treaty , which governs international police co-operation on ""international terrorism, kidnapping and money laundering"". The investigation that led to the court order was said to have arisen outside of the U.S. Rackspace stated that they were prohibited on giving further detail.  Agence France-Presse  reported FBI spokesman Joe Parris, the shut-down of several community radio stations in the US by the  Federal Communications Commission FCC , and a request by the FBI to remove a post on Nantes IMC containing a photograph of alleged undercover Swiss police. Criticism was also voiced by European civil liberties organisation  Statewatch  The subpoena also included a  gag order  that stated that the recipient is ""not to disclose the existence of this request unless authorized by the Assistant U.S. Attorney.""     Germany    In the aftermath of the violent  2017 G20 Hamburg summit  protests, the German  Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community  banned the German chapter of the network, Linksunten.indymedia. The ministry described the network as ""the central communications platform among far-left extremists prone to violence"" and stated that it was used to spread information about violent protest tactics. German  internet service provider s were ordered to block communication to the website. The German police also raided the addresses of several leading members and supporters of the Indymedia network in the  Baden-Württemberg  region. They seized knives, batons, pipes and slingshots from the apartments of the activists. Protesters also allege that the men were police and not local residents. Associated Press alleged that the protesters also had guns, describing the conflict as a ""shootout"".  In April 2008, in  Brazil , IMC and  posthumously  Brad Will received the  Medalha Chico Mendes de Resistência   ''Chico Mendes Resistance Medal'' in  Portuguese language Portuguese   from the Brazilian humanitarian group  Tortura Nunca Mais   ''No more torture'' in Portuguese  for their contributions to human rights and a more fair society.

It went live in January 1999 featuring open publishing, calendars, events and contacts. In March, around one hundred Sydney organisations were listed. The Active software consisted of a number of scripts and used the  LAMP  software bundle  LAMP  software stack.  The original Active software has been forked a number of times.  Notable custom  Indymedia content management systems include  Oscailt  used by Ireland indymedia; version 3.6 was released in March 2016.  Streamed Indymedia content was shown on Free Speech TV in 2004.    Organizational structure   Indymedia is formed of local collectives. They are run autonomously, but common rules include openness, inclusiveness and diversity. Editorial policies, locally chosen by any Indymedia collectives often involve removing articles which are believed to promote  racism ,  sexism ,  hate speech , and  homophobia . A clearly stated editorial policy is expected to be available on collectives' websites. In the same year, the Swiss edition of Indymedia was accused of anti-Semitism by  Aktion Kinder des Holocaust , which unsuccessfully sued them for publishing a  Carlos Latuff  cartoon of a Jewish boy in the  Warsaw Ghetto  saying ""I am Palestinian,"" though this was criticized by IMC as an attempt to stifle criticism of Israel in Switzerland.

Poterba    revenue   $33,263,297 The NBER is well known for providing start and end dates for  recession s in the United States.  Many of the Chairmen of the  Council of Economic Advisers  have been NBER Research Associates, including the former NBER President and  Harvard  Professor,  Martin Feldstein .  The NBER's current President and CEO is Professor  James M. Poterba  of  Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT .    History   The NBER was founded in 1920.  Its first staff economist, director of research, and one of its founders was American economist  Wesley Mitchell . He was succeeded by  Malcolm C. Rorty  in 1922.  The Russian American economist  Simon Kuznets , and student of Mitchell, was working at the NBER when the U.S. government recruited him to oversee the production of the first official estimates of  national income , published in 1934.  In the early 1940s, Kuznets' work on  national income  became the basis of official measurements of  GNP  and other related indices of economic activity. From this research come the NBER's Working Papers.      Sources of Inequality Research           ''Can Universal Screening Increase The Representation Of Low Income and Minority Students In Gifted Education''       One of the major research themes in the National Bureau of Economic research is sources of inequality. Kenneth Y. Chay, Jonathan Guryan, and Bhashkar Mazumder conducted a study in which they analyzed the substantial gaps in test scores on the AFQT and NAEP tests among black-white cohorts. The National Bureau of Economic Research published an article titled “Early Life Environment and Racial Inequality in Education and Earnings in The United States” to eliminate any possible biases in Chay, Guryan and Mazumders’ previous analysis and address the primary caveats.  The National Bureau of Economic Research uses the term ""gains"" to reflect improvement in racial convergence. Prior studies have concluded black gains in AFQT and NAEP scores in the early 1980s, black gains in college enrollment in the mid-1980s, and black gains in earnings throughout the 1990s. It is concluded that black gains were centered among cohorts of blacks born in the South during the 1960s and 70s; therefore, not only is the study geographically exclusive, but data is also inconsistent with the contemporary causes in the 1980s and 1990s. These results would rather be indicating that black gains in the 1990s were influenced by the Civil Rights and War on Poverty periods  25–30 years before the 1990s .  With response to the education gap, new findings show that the cross-cohort gains in college enrollment only pertained to blacks born in the South  there were no relative gains for black in the North . New findings also show that gains in relative earnings are limited to blacks born in the 1965 to 1972 cohorts  ages 28–35 in 2002  and show no gains for other age groups. To conclude, the findings of this updated study indicate that racial gains are due primarily in part to birth date and birthplace.       ''Racial Inequality in the 21st Century''       This study is a part of the NBER Working Paper Series, meaning it does not undergo the same peer and NBER board review as their regular research. Using data from the University of North Carolina system, which encompasses all public colleges in the state, the study looks at racial inequality at the collegiate level in regards to enrollment, completion, and various achievements, and the causation of such inequity. The study also mentions historically black colleges in North Carolina, and briefly questions whether they remain a positive contribution in contemporary America, arguing that they were a reaction to Jim Crow laws and tend to isolate African-American students from other racial groups.  Controlling for test scores, majors, and other scholastic factors, the study looks at administrative data from North Carolina K-12 public schools of eighth graders both in 1999 and 2004, categorized both by race and socioeconomic standing. It then tracks these students through their expected graduation dates of both high school and college, given they continued to a North Carolina university, and they examined whatever racial stratification occurred within those time periods based on enrollment and graduation rates at each university.  The study found that African-Americans in the North Carolina public school system are greatly disadvantaged. In one group, controlling for gender, the study found that, of the 2004 eighth graders, African-American students were 4.6% less likely to attend a North Carolina university than their white peers, and “5.5 percentage points less likely to enroll and graduate within four years.” However, when controlling for parental higher education and eighth grade tests scores, the study found that African-American students of the aforementioned grouping are more likely to attend and graduate within four years from a North Carolina university, which the study attributes to the abundance of historically black colleges in the state.

However, they do not precisely define what is meant by ""a significant decline,"" but rather determine if one has existed on a case by case basis after examining their catalogued factors which have no defined grade scale or weighting factors.

Wyndgate Country Club and Richard Dawkins, 2011      During  Richard Dawkins ' October 2011 book tour, Center for Inquiry - the tour's sponsor - signed a contract with Wyndgate Country Club in Rochester Hills, Michigan, as the venue site.  After seeing an interview with Dawkins on '' The O'Reilly Factor '', an official at the club cancelled Dawkins' appearance. Dawkins said that the country club official accepted  Bill O'Reilly  political commentator  Bill O'Reilly 's ""twisted"" interpretation of his book '' The Magic of Reality '' without having read it personally.  Sean Faircloth  said that cancelling the reading ""really violates the basic principles of America ... The Civil Rights Act ... prohibits discrimination based on race or religious viewpoint. ... [Dawkins has] published numerous books ... to explain science to the public, so it's rather an affront, to reason in general, to shun him as they did."" CFI Michigan executive director Jeff Seaver stated that ""This action by The Wyndgate illustrates the kind of bias and bigotry that nonbelievers encounter all the time.""  While this case was in progress, after the appellate finding, Republican legislators began an effort to amend the Florida constitution to remove the language of the Blaine amendment, succeeding in 2011 to place the measure on the 2012 ballot as amendment 8.  The ballot measure failed.  In 2015, CHS  now CFI  and the state  along with its co-defendants  both filed for summary judgement. The court granted the state's motion in January, 2016, allowing the contested contracting practice to continue. After consideration, CFI announced in February, 2016, that it would not appeal.

In the spring of 2005, the ''Herald'' joined several other CanWest Global affiliates in launching '' Dose  magazine  Dose '', a free daily newspaper targeted at 20-something commuters; it was discontinued as a print publication after a year.     Guy Huntingford    In August 2010 Paul Godfrey President and CEO of Postmedia Network announced the appointment of Guy Huntingford as publisher of the ''Calgary Herald'' as it ""continues its transformation into an integrated multimedia brand."" Many seasoned journalists were replaced by inexperienced staff and it took several years for the ''Herald'' to rebuild its readership after the strike. Former ''Herald'' staff who left during or as a result of the strike can be found working for other publications, most notably the weekly business-oriented publication ''Business Edge''.  On 25 February 2011 the  Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada   CEP  asked the  Canadian federal government federal government  to review  under the  Investment Canada Act   the 2010 purchase of the newspaper by  Postmedia Network .

She is the founder of ''Feminist Frequency'', a website that hosts videos and commentary analyzing portrayals of women in  popular culture . She has received particular attention for her video series '' Tropes vs. Women in Video Games '', which examines  trope  literature  tropes  in the depiction of female video game characters.  In 2012, Sarkeesian was targeted by an online harassment campaign following her launch of a  Kickstarter  project to fund the ''Tropes vs. Women in Video Games'' series. Supporters donated almost $160,000 to the project, far beyond the $6,000 she had sought. The situation was covered extensively in the media, placing Sarkeesian at the center of discussions about  misogyny  in  video game culture  and online harassment. She has spoken to  TED  conference  TEDxWomen ,  XOXO Festival , and the  United Nations ' Broadband Working Group on Gender, and appeared on '' The Colbert Report '' discussing her experiences of harassment and the challenge of attempting to improve gender inclusivity in gaming culture and the media.    Early life   Sarkeesian was born in Canada and grew up near  Toronto . Her parents are  Armenians in Iraq Armenians from Iraq  who emigrated to Canada in the 1970s. The series comprises six videos dedicated to tropes such as the  Manic Pixie Dream Girl ,  Women in Refrigerators  and the  Smurfette Principle . She spoke at conferences and workshops about media criticism and video blogging, and was interviewed by UK Sunday newspaper '' The Observer '' in March 2012 about modern media culture, stating  ""I think to the extent that it could be creating authentic, human female characters, it is a push towards a more feminist media."" Her blog has been utilized as material for university-level  women's studies  courses, and she has spoken at universities on the topic of female characters in pop culture.  Sarkeesian was inspired to start a video series on female representation in video games after she was invited to speak to developers at  Bungie .  The first three videos discuss examples of the "" Damsel in distress Damsels in Distress "" trope, in which passive and often helpless female characters must be rescued by the male hero.  In March 2016, ''Feminist Frequency'' began a formal partnership with the  Crash Override Network , agreeing to serve as its fiscal sponsor. Toronto feminist Stephanie Guthrie received death and rape threats for criticizing the ''Beat Up Anita Sarkeesian'' game.  In August 2014, ''Feminist Frequency'' issued a new ''Tropes vs Women in Games'' episode. This coincided with the ongoing harassment of  Zoë Quinn  as part of the  Gamergate controversy . The increased volume and specificity of the harassment  including death threats  prompted Sarkeesian to leave her home. San Francisco Police confirmed that they had passed the case file to the  Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI  for investigation. specifically cited the 1989  École Polytechnique massacre  in  Montreal Montreal, Quebec , Canada as inspiration. The university and police did not believe the threats were credible inasmuch as they were consistent with others Sarkeesian had received, but scheduled enhanced security measures nonetheless. Sarkeesian canceled the event, however, feeling the planned security measures were insufficient given that the university could not prohibit handguns in the venue per Utah state law.  The media scholar Soraya Murray describes the attack as a ""watershed moment"" in the ""culture war"" being fought over representations of women and minorities in video games.    Reception and public appearances    File Anita Sarkeesian 2013.jpg thumb Sarkeesian speaking at Media Evolutions The Conference 2013  Sarkeesian and her work have come to much greater public attention following the announcement of ''Tropes vs. Women in Video Games'' and the harassment she subsequently faced. These events helped bring the issue of pervasive  sexual harassment  in  video game culture  to mainstream media attention.  Soraya Murray identified Sarkeesian as emblematic of ""a burgeoning organized feminist critique"" of stereotyped and objectified portrayals of women in video games.  While noting that the support Sarkeesian has received ""stands at a counter"" to the harassment, Sal Humphreys and Karen Orr Vered suggest that ultimately the campaign may serve to discourage other women from following Sarkeesian's lead for fear of being subjected to similar attacks. She appears in the 2015 documentary '' GTFO  film  GTFO ''.    Awards and nominations   Sarkeesian's ''Feminist Frequency'' blog was highlighted by ''Feminist Collections'' and ''Media Report to Women''. In December 2014, '' The Verge '' named her as one of ""the 50 most important people at the intersection of technology, art, science, and culture"".

Freedom House sponsored influential radio programs including ''The Voice of Freedom''  1942–43   Freedom House was highly critical of  McCarthyism .    In 1967, Freedom House absorbed Books USA, which had been created several years earlier by  Edward R. Murrow ,  Since 2001, Freedom House has supported citizens involved in challenges to the existing regimes in Serbia, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Egypt, Tunisia and elsewhere. The organization states, ""From South Africa to Jordan, Kyrgyzstan to Indonesia, Freedom House has partnered with regional activists in bolstering civil society; worked to support women's rights; sought justice for victims of torture; defended journalists and free expression advocates; and assisted those struggling to promote human rights in challenging political environments."" the grants were not earmarked by the government but allocated through a competitive process.    Organization    File 1301 Connecticut Avenue.JPG thumb Freedom House headquarters in  Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C. Dupont Circle , Washington, D.C.   Freedom House is a nonprofit organization with approximately 150 staff members worldwide. while past board-members have included  Zbigniew Brzezinski ,  Jeane Kirkpatrick ,  Samuel P. Huntington Samuel Huntington ,  Mara Liasson ,  Otto Reich ,  Donald Rumsfeld ,  Whitney North Seymour ,  Paul Wolfowitz ,  Steve Forbes  and  Bayard Rustin .      Funding     According to the ''Freedom House Financial Statement 2016'', Freedom House ""was substantially funded by grants from the U.S. Government"", with grants from the United States government accounting for approximately 86% of revenue. In 2018, the US government gave Freedom House $35,206,355, or 88% of its annual revenue. <center>  </center> caption2 Countries highlighted in <span style ""color  navy"">'''blue'''</span> are designated ""electoral democracies"" in Freedom House's 2017 survey ''Freedom in the World'', covering the year 2016. the current state of  civil rights civil  and  Freedom  political  political rights  on a scale from 1  most free  to 7  least free .  Until 2003, states where the average for political and civil liberties differed from 1.0 to 2.5 were considered ""free"". States with values from 3.0 to 5.5 were considered ""partly free"" and those with values between 5.5 and 7.0 as ""not free"". Since 2003 the scope of the ""partly free"" ranges from 3.0 to 5.0, ""not free"" from 5.5 to 7.0.  These reports are often Freedom House states that the rights and liberties of the survey are derived in large measure from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  The country and territory ratings were proposed by the analyst responsible for each related report. The ratings were reviewed individually and on a comparative basis in a series of six regional meetings—Asia-Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Western Europe—involving the analysts, academic advisors with expertise in each region, and Freedom House staff. The ratings were compared to the previous year's findings, and any major proposed numerical shifts or category changes were subjected to more intensive scrutiny. These reviews were followed by cross-regional assessments in which efforts were made to ensure comparability and consistency in the findings. Many of the key country reports were also reviewed by the academic advisers.     ''Freedom of the Press''     File FreedomHouse-FreedomOfThePress-WorldMap.svg thumb upright 1.6 <center>'''2015 Freedom of the Press Classifications''' It provides numerical rankings and rates each country's media as ""Free,"" ""Partly Free,"" or ""Not Free."" Individual country narratives examine the legal environment for the media, political pressures that influence reporting, and economic factors that affect access to information.  The annual survey, which provides analytical reports and numerical ratings for 196 countries and territories in 2011, continues a process conducted since 1980. The findings are widely used by governments, international organizations, academics, and the news media in many countries. Countries are given a total score from 0  best  to 100  worst  on the basis of a set of 23 methodology questions divided into three subcategories  legal environment, political environment, and the economic environment. Assigning numerical points allows for comparative analysis among the countries surveyed and facilitates an examination of trends over time. Countries scoring 0 to 30 are regarded as having ""Free"" media; 31 to 60, ""Partly Free"" media; and 61 to 100, ""Not Free"" media. The ratings and reports included in each annual report cover events that took place during the previous year, for example ''Freedom of the Press 2011'' covers events that took place between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2010.  An independent review of press freedom studies, commissioned by the Knight Foundation in 2006, found that FOP is the best in its class of Press Freedom Indicators. There was no report in 2010. The reports generally cover the period from June through May.   {  class ""wikitable""  + '''Freedom on the Net Survey Results''' !  &nbsp;       !! 2009   ''Countries at the Crossroads''  first published in 2004, covers countries on the borderline of democracy.     Special reports    Freedom House has produced more than 85 special reports since 2002, including    ''A New Multilateralism for Atrocities Prevention''  2015 &nbsp;   ''Today's American  How Free?''  a special report which examines whether Americans in 2008 were sacrificing essential values in the war against terror, and scrutinizes other critical issues such as the political process, criminal justice system, racial inequality and immigration.   ''Freedom of Association Under Threat  The New Authoritarians' Offensive Against Civil Society''  2007 &nbsp;    Criticism        Relationship with the U.S. Government     In 2006, the '' Financial Times '' reported that Freedom House received funding by the State Department for 'clandestine activities' inside  Iran .</blockquote>   Noam Chomsky  and  Edward S. Herman  have criticized the organization for excessively criticizing states opposed to US interests while being unduly sympathetic to regimes supportive of US interests.     Russia    Russia, identified by Freedom House as ""Not Free"", called Freedom House biased and accused the group of serving U.S. interests.  Sergei Markov , an MP from the United Russia party, called Freedom House a ""Russophobic"" organization  ""You can listen to everything they say, except when it comes to Russia ... There are many Russophobes there"".     Alleged partiality toward Uzbekistan     Craig Murray , the British ambassador to  Uzbekistan  from 2002 to 2004, wrote that the executive director of Freedom House told him in 2003 that the group decided to back off from its efforts to spotlight human rights abuses in Uzbekistan, because some Republican board members  in Murray's words  ""expressed concern that Freedom House was failing to keep in sight the need to promote freedom in the widest sense, by giving full support to U.S. and coalition forces"". Human rights abuses in Uzbekistan at the time included the killing of prisoners  by ""immersion in boiling liquid,"" and by strapping on a gas mask and blocking the filters, Murray reported. States can therefore ""look formally liberal-democratic but might be rather illiberal in their actual workings"". In a later report by Bollen and Pamela Paxton in 2000, they concluded that from 1972 to 1988  a specific period they observed , there was ""unambiguous evidence of judge-specific measurement errors, which are related to traits of the countries."" They estimated that Gastil's method produced a bias of 0.38&nbsp; standard&nbsp;deviation s&nbsp; s.d.  against  Marxist–Leninist  countries and a larger bias, 0.5&nbsp;s.d., favoring Christian countries. However, according to Przeworski in 2003, the definition of freedom in Gastil  1982  and Freedom House  1990  emphasized liberties rather than the exercise of freedom. He gave the following example  In the United States, citizens are free to form political parties and to vote, yet even in presidential elections only half of U.S. citizens vote; in the U.S., ""the same two parties speak in a commercially sponsored unison"".  A 2014 report by comparative politics researcher Nils D. Steiner found ""strong and consistent evidence of a substantial bias in the FH ratings"" before 1988, with bias being reflected by the relationships between the US and the countries under investigation. He writes that after 1989 the findings weren't as strong, but still hinted at political bias.    Recognition   Former US President  Bill Clinton , giving a speech at a Freedom House breakfast, said    <blockquote>I'm honored to be here with all of you and to be here at Freedom House. For more than 50 years, Freedom House has been a voice for tolerance for human dignity. People all over the world are better off because of your work. And I'm very grateful that Freedom House has rallied this diverse and dynamic group. It's not every day that the  Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Carnegie Endowment , the  Progressive Policy Institute ,  The Heritage Foundation , and the  American Foreign Policy Council  share the same masthead.</blockquote>  Speaking at a screening of film ''The Magnitsky Files'', Senator  John McCain  said   <blockquote> Thank you for everything that Freedom House continues to do on behalf of people around the world who suffer oppression and persecution. I'm honored to have known you and to have the opportunity to work with you around the world ... We rely on organizations like Freedom House to make judgments about corruption and the persecution of minorities ...</blockquote>  Miller nevertheless criticized the organization in 2007 as not paying enough attention to slavery in its reports. He wrote that repressive regimes,  and even democracies such as Germany and India, needed to be held to account for their lack of enforcement of laws against human trafficking and the bondage of some foreign workers.

In December 2010, the Tucson office was closed in preparation for two new satellite research offices. The reason for the closure of the Tucson branch was also related to the university's budget cuts, which eliminated Vote Smart's ""rent-free space at a 1,500- square-foot house off the main campus.""  Vote Smart has since left the University of Southern California and moved its Political Courage Department to its Montana research center.  In March 2014, Vote Smart laid off six employees, citing financial difficulties. A seventh employee quit because of the sudden layoffs.

Political Courage Test     The Political Courage Test  The response to the Political Courage Test has dropped, from 72% in 1996 to 48% in 2008, because politicians from both parties are afraid that challengers will use their responses out of context in attack ads, according to '' The Wall Street Journal ''.  Rep. Anne Gannon, Democratic leader pro tempore of the  Florida House of Representatives , stated  ""We tell our candidates not to do it. It sets them up for a hit piece."" In response, Vote Smart has tried to shame politicians into it, and lets them leave up to 30% of answers blank.

It is supported financially by  First Look Media First Look Media , owned by  Pierre Omidyar . Its editors are  Betsy Reed ,  Glenn Greenwald , and  Jeremy Scahill . The publication initially served as a platform to report on the documents released by  Edward Snowden , with the long-term goal of producing journalism across a wide range of issues. The report included a top-secret NSA animation showing how the agency disguised itself as a  Facebook  server in order to hack into computers for surveillance. Following the report, ''The Intercept'' was criticized by  WikiLeaks  for withholding the name of one country whose calls were being recorded. In August 2014, ''The Intercept'' reported that nearly half of the people on the U.S. government's widely shared database of terrorist suspects were not connected to any known terrorist group. The revelations were praised by  Pentagon Papers   whistleblower , Daniel Ellsberg, and NSA leaker,  Edward Snowden , who said  ""When we look back on today, we will find the most important national security story of the year."" Senior command staff were aware of the misconduct, but did little to stop it, and in some cases helped to cover up the wrongdoing, according to the report. The documents also showed that the FBI uses the threat of deportation to turn immigrants into confidential informants. In April 2016, ''The Intercept'' won the People's Voice award for best news website at the twentieth annual  Webby Awards . The same year, ''The Intercept'' won a Hillman Prize for Web Journalism for an investigative series by Jamie Kalven exposing criminality within the Chicago Police Department. ""It's a criminal act that has us very concerned,"" said Evanina, a former FBI special agent with a counter-terrorism specialty who was appointed NCE by  Director of National Intelligence   James R. Clapper  in May 2014.  TechCrunch  referred to the story as clear evidence of ""unabashed opposition to security  War hawk#Variations of the term hawks ."" Wittes wrote,<blockquote>If I were a foreign intelligence agency, I'd be looking at this as a great way to send enticing-looking documents, maybe even real ones, that contain some nifty bits of executable code that offered visibility for me onto the activities of people with access to the Snowden materials, people who are talking to and recruiting other leakers. Or maybe I'd be drop some honey-pot files, some files that beacon their location. Or maybe I'd just use the opportunity to drop disinformation on journalists who have shown they will believe just about anything if it's disparaging of U.S. intelligence.  Reed apologized to readers and to those misquoted. She noted that some of Thompson's work, most of it using public sources, was verifiable. Editors alerted any downstream users of the affected stories, and promised to take similar action if further fabrication came to light.  He was fired by ''The Intercept'' in early 2016, and according to Reed, did not cooperate with the investigation into his actions. One hour after publication, a 25-year old NSA contract employee named  Reality Winner  was arrested by the  Federal Bureau of Investigation  and charged under the  Espionage Act of 1917 . calling them ""radical conspiracy theories.""</blockquote> NSA quickly identified the leaker of the documents. ''The Intercept'' has been criticized for unprofessional handling of the document, and indifference to the source's safety.  NSA whistleblower  John Kiriakou  and  Guantanamo Bay detention camp  whistleblower Joseph Hickman have both accused the same reporter accused of revealing Winner's identity, Matthew Cole, of playing a role in their exposure, which, in Kiriakou's case, led to his imprisonment.

History    File Toronto Sun Building.jpg thumb left The former Toronto Sun building at 333 King Street East in 2007.   File TorontoSunVendingMachine.jpg thumb A Toronto Sun newspaper vending machine  The ''Sun'' was first published on November 1, 1971, the Monday after the demise of  the '' Toronto Telegram '', a conservative  broadsheet . As there was no publishing gap between the two papers and many of the Tely's writers and employees moved to the new paper, it is today generally considered as a direct continuation of the ''Telegram''. The ''Sun'' is the holder of the ''Telegram'' archives.  The ''Toronto Sun'' is modeled on British  Red tops tabloid journalism , even borrowing the name of '' The Sun  United Kingdom  The Sun '' newspaper published in London, and sharing some similar features of that paper.  As of the end of 2007, the ''Sun'' had a Monday through Saturday circulation of approximately 180,000 papers and Sunday circulation of 310,000.  The ''Sun'' is owned by  Postmedia  following the 2015 purchase of  Sun Media  from  Quebecor .  Torstar , the parent company of the ''Toronto Star'', once attempted to purchase the ''Sun''. The paper, which boasts the slogan ""Toronto's Other Voice""  also once called ""The Little Paper that Grew""  acquired a television station from  Craig Media Inc. Craig Media  in 2005, which was renamed  CKXT-TV SUN TV  and later was transformed into the  Sun News Network  until its demise in 2015. By the mid-2000s  decade , the word ""The"" was dropped from the paper's name and the newspaper adopted its current logo.  The ''Toronto Sun'''s first editor was  Peter Worthington . He assumed the title ""editor-in-chief"" in 1976, resigned in 1982 to protest the newspaper's takeover by Maclean-Hunter but remained a columnist for the paper until his death in 2013. He was succeeded by  Barbara Amiel  who, in turn, was succeeded by  John Downing   as editor . Other senior editors have included Lorrie Goldstein  city editor, editorial page editor , Linda Williamson  senior associate editor , Rob Granatstein  editorial page editor , and as editors-in-chief  Peter O'Sullivan,  Mike Strobel , Jim Jennings, Glenn Garnett  2006–2007 , Lou Clancy  2007–2009 , James Wallace  2008–2013  and Wendy Metcalfe  2013-2015 . The current editor-in-chief is  Adrienne Batra ; the publisher is Mike Power.  The ''Toronto Sun'' was originally published out of leased space at the Eclipse White Wear Company Building at 322 King Street West. In 1975, the newspaper moved into the  Toronto Sun Building  at 333 King Street East which was eventually expanded to six storeys to house all of the newspaper's operations. In 2010, the building was sold to property development company First Gulf, the Sun consolidated its operations onto the second floor and remained in the building until 2016.  Following the acquisition of the Sun newspaper chain by  Postmedia Network PostMedia  in 2015, it was announced that the ''Toronto Sun'' staff and operations will move to 365 Bloor Street East, the same building that houses the '' National Post '', but that the two newspapers will maintain separate newsrooms. The move occurred in March 2016.     Circulation    The ''Toronto Sun'' has seen—like most  List of newspapers in Canada#Daily newspapers Canadian daily newspapers —a decline in  Newspaper circulation circulation . Its total circulation dropped by   percent to 121,304 copies daily from 2009 to 2015.     Sister papers   The ''Toronto Sun'''s  Compact  newspaper  format  has given rise to sister Sun newspapers in major markets across Canada, namely the '' Edmonton Sun '', the '' Calgary Sun '' and the '' Ottawa Sun ''. The '' Winnipeg Sun '' was originally launched by independent interests, only later coming under common ownership to the ''Toronto Sun'', which subsequently elicited a redesign in Sun Media style.  '' The Vancouver Sun '' is a broadsheet and was never a  Sun Media  newspaper. Due to the acquisition of Sun Media by the  Postmedia Network , the ''Vancouver Sun'' now shares the same owner as the other Sun newspapers; '' The Province '', also owned by Postmedia Network, Inc, is Vancouver's traditional daily paper.    Editors-in-chief   The ''Toronto Sun'' originally had several editors with various responsibilities, none with the title ""editor-in-chief""; however, from 1971 to 1976, Peter Worthington was listed on the newspaper's masthead immediately under the publisher, Doug Creighton.

It was the UK's first licensed  Commercial broadcasting commercial   radio station , beginning broadcasting on Monday 8 October 1973,      London News Radio    The company almost disappeared later in 1993, when the  Radio Authority  failed to renew the company's two licences, LBC Newstalk and London Talkback Radio, awarding the frequencies instead to '''London News Radio''', a consortium led by former LBC staff and backed by  Guinness Mahon . Some claimed he held no previous experience in the talk and chat radio genre, which overlooked the almost two years he spent with the  Century FM  brand in its Border TV ownership days where the station was a 50/50 music/talk service. He also introduced a  PODcasting podcasting  service called LBC Plus, and a number of premium-rate promotional opportunities to replace falling advertising revenues experienced by the radio sector.  In September 2006, the LBC 97.3 station became available in some other parts of the country on the digital  Digital audio broadcasting DAB  platform, after Chrysalis bought out its partners and closed the  DNN  radio  Digital News Network  rolling news station, which had previously been carried on the MXR multiplex.  Each multiplex region – the North West, West Midlands, Yorkshire, North East, South Wales, and the West – broadcast the London LBC transmission, augmented with occasional bulletins of regional news and travel information. Further media speculation from '' The Guardian '' suggested that the group had little option, due to shareholder pressure, to sell its radio arm, including LBC, raising up to £200 million for new acquisitions, while '' The Daily Telegraph '' suggested that it could be the subject of a management buyout. Subsequently it was announced on 25 June 2007 that LBC along with its sister stations  The Arrow  radio  The Arrow ,  Heart Network Heart , and  Galaxy Radio Galaxy  network were to be sold for £170 million to  Global Radio  by the  Chrysalis Group , whose Chrysalis Radio operation closed down.  Towards the end of October 2012, the station ceased DAB broadcasts to some parts of the country.  On 30 January 2014, LBC announced its intention to return to the DAB platform and began broadcasting nationally at 7am on 11 February 2014 under a new slogan, ""Leading Britain's Conversation"". LBC took up the slot previously occupied by  Jazz FM  UK  Jazz FM   and briefly  Birdsong  digital radio channel  Birdsong  , and dropped the ""97.3"" from the station name to reinforce the notion that it now had national coverage.    Controversies      Tony Blair appearance    On 13 January 2004, then British  Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Prime Minister   Tony Blair  presented an hour-long phone-in show on the station, taking pre-booked calls from LBC 97.3 listeners. His appearance was part of the 'Big Conversation' initiative to promote government as being more accessible and in touch with the people. During the 1011am show, a caller explained that he'd been denied access to his children for five years and asked what Blair was planning to do about other fathers in a similar situation. The Prime Minister assured the caller he would look into his case personally. It later transpired that the caller was in fact  Fathers 4 Justice  member Ron Davis, who in May of that year was arrested for entering Parliament and throwing a condom containing purple powder over Blair and nearby Cabinet members. Davis claimed the attack was in response to the Prime Minister's failure to contact him or look into the matters discussed on LBC 97.3. Until the spring of 2016, he co-hosted a slot on Saturday mornings with David Mellor.  Norman Lamb  MP tabled an  Early Day Motion  criticising Barnett and LBC for the likely effect of the broadcast on public health. This show ran from 13 January to 30 March that year. Salmond was then given a three-hour Sunday afternoon show, starting in 17 September 2017, after he lost his seat in the  UK general election 2017 .

The magazine also continues to use a few spellings that are otherwise little used, such as ''focussed'', ''venders'', ''teen-ager'',     Readership    Despite its title, ''The New Yorker'' is read nationwide, with 53 percent of its circulation in the top 10 U.S. metropolitan areas. According to Mediamark Research Inc., the average age of ''The New Yorker'' reader in 2009 was 47  compared to 43 in 1980 and 46 in 1990 . The average household income of ''The New Yorker'' readers in 2009 was $109,877  the average income in 1980 was $62,788 and the average income in 1990 was $70,233 .

The magazine's first cover illustration, a  dandy  peering at a butterfly through a  monocle , was drawn by  Rea Irvin , the magazine's first art editor, based on an 1834 caricature of the then  Alfred Guillaume Gabriel, Count d'Orsay Count d'Orsay  which appeared as an illustration in the 11th edition of the '' Encyclopædia Britannica ''.     Covers     The magazine is well known for its illustrated and often topical covers.      ""View of the World"" cover       File Steinberg New Yorker Cover.png thumb right  Saul Steinberg 's ""View of the World from Ninth Avenue"" cover  Saul Steinberg created 85 covers and 642 internal drawings and illustrations for the magazine. His most famous work is probably its March 29, 1976 cover,  The March 21, 2009 cover of '' The Economist '', ""How China sees the World"", is also an homage to the original image, but depicting the viewpoint from Beijing's  Chang'an Avenue  instead of Manhattan. In September 2004, Spiegelman reprised the image on the cover of his book '' In the Shadow of No Towers '', in which he relates his experience of the Twin Towers attack and the psychological after-effects.      ""New Yorkistan""      In the December 2001 issue the magazine printed a cover by  Maira Kalman  and  Rick Meyerowitz  showing a map of New York in which various neighborhoods were labeled with humorous names reminiscent of Middle Eastern and Central Asian place names and referencing the neighborhood's real name or characteristics  e.g., ""Fuhgeddabouditstan"", ""Botoxia"" . The cover had some cultural resonance in the wake of September 11, and became a popular print and poster.  Many ''New Yorker'' readers saw the image as a lampoon of ""The Politics of Fear"", as was its title. Some of Obama's supporters as well as his presumptive Republican opponent,  John McCain Sen. John McCain , accused the magazine of publishing an incendiary cartoon whose irony could be lost on some readers. However, editor David Remnick felt the image's obvious excesses rebuffed the concern that it could be misunderstood, even by those unfamiliar with the magazine. The ''New Yorker'' Obama cover was later parodied by Stewart and  Stephen Colbert  on the October 3, 2008, cover of '' Entertainment Weekly '' magazine, with Stewart as Obama and Colbert as Michelle, photographed for the magazine in New York City on September 18. The '' Sesame Street '' characters have long been rumored in popular culture and urban legend to be  homosexual  partners, though  Sesame Workshop  has repeatedly denied this, saying they are merely ""puppets"" and have no sexual orientation. Reaction was mixed. Online magazine '' Slate  magazine  Slate '' criticized the cover, which shows Ernie leaning on Bert's shoulder as they watch a television with the Supreme Court justices on the screen, saying ""it's a terrible way to commemorate a major civil-rights victory for gay and lesbian couples."" '' The Huffington Post '', meanwhile, said it was ""one of [the magazine's] most awesome covers of all time"".

From that perspective it can be seen as opposing its values of Tradition, Family, and Property to the French Revolution's values of '' Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité ''.   A recent study pointed out that ""TFP draws on a rigid interpretation of Christianity to offer the faithful an all-encompassing ideological justification for what are, in essence, very conservative politics.""     International expansion and cooperation     TFP is both a national organization and a transnational movement which shares fundamental beliefs, goals, publications,  Shortly after its foundation in Brazil in 1960, the TFP began a program of international expansion, beginning with a ""Latin American Congress of Catholicism"" in  Serra Negra , Brazil, attended by about 350 Brazilians and about 20 representatives from other countries in  Hispanic America . but they did publish it in 44 other major newspapers worldwide. In the late 60s the TFP gained the apparent support of the Argentine military regime when they called for a purge of progressive clergy from the Catholic Church. in their 1961 book, ''Agrarian Reform—A Question of Conscience'', which treated private property as a moral absolute.   Notably, at their 23rd general assembly in 1985 the Brazilian Bishops criticized TFP for its ""lack of communion … with the Church in Brazil, its hierarchy, and the Holy Father"" and for its ""esoteric character, the religious fanaticism, and the cult given to the personality of its leader and his mother.""  After an unfavorable court decision in 2004 the remaining, politically active, faction formed the Association of Founders of TFP to continue the original expression of their social ideals and to contest the court case.  They opposed the government of  Salvador Allende  and welcomed the  Chilean Coup of 1973 1973 military coup  that overthrew his  Popular Unity  Chile  Popular Unity  government.  In 1976, during the  Government Junta of Chile  1973  Pinochet dictatorship , the TFP published a book maintaining that Catholics are duty bound to resist pastors and clergy who support the hierarchy, especially the defender of human rights Cardinal  Raúl Silva Henríquez , who they said was leading the country toward Communism.  Its statutes set the goals of defending the fundamental principles of Christian Civilization and opposing the principles of liberal and egalitarian revolution and the communism and socialism which that revolution engendered.  The Commission defined as pseudo-Catholic those organizations that appeal to the Catholic tradition which they maintain against the reforms imposed by Rome.  TFP was also seen to exemplify a mastery of commercial fund-raising techniques, with a network of closely related organizations targeting messages to susceptible recipients. and to provide theological support for the idea of a natural inequality in society.  Early targets of TFP's expansion into South Africa were the Catholic, Portuguese speaking, refugees from newly independent  Mozambique .  One of its activities was to oppose the newspaper, ''New Nation'', which had been funded by the  Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference , advanced  liberation theology , and opposed apartheid but which TFP saw as ""communist inspired"".  TFP sought to undermine the bishops' popular support and appealed, unsuccessfully, to the Pope that he ban the paper.  TFP's efforts were more successful in providing justification for the government's three-month suspension of the newspaper in 1987.  The State President and an unnamed government minister wrote the TFP commending them for supporting the goals of the  National Party  South Africa  National Party  government.     United States     The '''American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property''' was founded in the United States in 1973, stemming from a group who in 1971 had founded a magazine, ''Crusade for a Christian Civilization''.

The first TFP was founded by Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira in Brazil in 1960, inspired by his 1959 book Revolution and Counter-Revolution which became the TFPs' foundational text, later supplemented by his 1993 Nobility and Analogous Traditional Elites in the Allocutions of Pius XII. He remained president of the Brazilian TFP's national council until his death in 1995. After his death, there was a legal battle upon the title and ownership of the Brazilian TFP, which was ultimately won by João Scognamiglio Clá Dias, in 2004, while he had created previously the Heralds of the Gospel  2001 . Those who opposed this action have remained active in the Association of the Founders of TFP and created the Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira Institute  Portuguese  Instituto Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira , which claims the legacy of the original TFP.

It was founded on February 23, 1893, and became a daily newspaper in 1929. Dailytarheel.com draws an average of 11,400 unique visitors per school day. Revenues from advertising are self-generated through a student-run advertising staff.  The student journalists are solely responsible for all content under the direction of the student editor-in-chief. The 2018&ndash;19 editor is Rachel Jones.     Early history     Image The Tar Heel Feb 23 1893 first issue.jpg 200px thumbnail Front page of the first issue of ''The Tar Heel'', later renamed to ''The Daily Tar Heel''  The newspaper was first published on February 23, 1893 as a four-page weekly tabloid called ''The Tar Heel.'' It aimed to promote ""the thorough discussion of all points pertaining to the advancement and growth of the University."" In 1923, it came out from under the auspices of the athletic association and became governed by the Student Publications Union Board, which at the time was in charge of all campus publications. Students paid a fee of $5.50 to fund the publications.     Independence    In the 1970s and 1980s, student editors used the paper's front-page quote to agitate many on campus; selections included Nietzsche's ""God is dead."" The state Supreme Court's 1998 ruling established the Honor Court as a public body. The column made national headlines and ultimately led to the columnist's dismissal, but officially only for her quoting a source in a manner considered out-of-context. The move doubled the amount of office space available to staff and placed the paper one-tenth of a mile away from its original 1893 office. The lawsuit concerns records related to UNC's investigation into alleged improper relationships with athletic agents and academic misconduct surrounding the football team.  On September 2016, ''The Daily Tar Heel'' filed the lawsuit against UNC to obtain access to public records concerning the identification of students or employees who have committed rape or sexual assault.  In conjuncture with the ''Daily Tar Heel'' financial struggles, in February 2018 the newsroom was moved from the large Rosemary Street office to a smaller, more consolidated space at 210 E. Franklin Street in Suite 210. Though the move has strong ties to the fiscal state of ''The Daily Tar Heel'', their newer office is closer to UNC's central campus, and is in the midst of action on Franklin Street.      Financial Struggle     Since 2011, ''The Daily Tar Heel'' has been losing money. In recent years, the 124-year-old newspaper has had an annual deficit of about $200,000. ''The Tar Heel'' has also cut the number of days in print to three. In March 2017, Donovan said the University of North Carolina's 2017  North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball men's basketball  national championship reduced the ''Tar Heel''s deficit from about $100,000 to less than $50,000 for the fiscal year. The organization's annual revenue at the time was just under $900,000 per year.    Accolades and awards   The ''DTH'' has been recognized as one of the best college newspapers in the country. It was named the best college newspaper by '' The Princeton Review '' in 2007 and 2011 and appeared in the list's top 5 in 2010, 2012, and 2013.

It has been praised as an ""invaluable"" resource  Concerning this change in their 'mission statement,'  Political Research Associates   PRA , which studies the US  right-wing politics political right , notes that it occurred three weeks after the  September 11 attacks , and considers MEMRI ""was previously more forthcoming about its political orientation in its self-description and in staff profiles on its website"". PRA considers that ""MEMRI's slogan, 'Bridging the Language Gap Between the Middle East and the West,' does not convey the institute's stridently pro-Israel and  anti-Arab  political bias."" It further notes, that MEMRI's founders, Wurmser and Carmon, ""are both hardline pro-Israel ideologues aligned with Israel's  Likud  party"".      Projects     MEMRI's work is organized into projects, each with a specific focus. The main subjects the organization addresses are  jihad  and  terrorism ; relations between the U.S. and Middle East; pro-democracy and pro-civil rights views; inter-Arab relations; and  Antisemitism anti-Semitism . The project is sponsored by the  United States Department of State U.S. State Department . Established in 2004, The project disseminates jihadi-associated social media content and propaganda released by various Islamic State media companies. According to MEMRI, the CJL's goal is to inform and make recommendations to legislators and the business community about the threat of cyberterrorism. the Iran Studies Project,    Financial support   MEMRI is registered in the US with the IRS as a  501 c  3   non-profit organization. They have a policy of not accepting money from governments, relying instead on around 250 private donors, including other organizations and foundations. that monitors the financial ties of conservative think tanks to conservative foundations in the United States, reported that for the years 1999 to 2004, MEMRI received $100,000 from  Bradley Foundation The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, Inc. , $100,000 from  Randolph Foundation The Randolph Foundation , and $5,000 from the  John M. Olin Foundation . that evaluates the financial health of America's largest charities, has given MEMRI a four-star  exceptional  rating, meaning that it ""... exceeds industry standards and outperforms most charities in its Cause"" when rated on its financial health.    Reception   The organization's translations are regularly quoted by major international newspapers, and its work has generated strong criticism and praise. Critics have accused MEMRI of producing inaccurate, unreliable translations with undue emphasis and selectivity in translating and disseminating the most extreme views from  Arabic  and  Persian language Persian  media, which portray the Arab and  Muslim world  in a negative light, while ignoring moderate views that are often found in the same media outlets. Other critics charge that while MEMRI does sometimes translate pro-US or pro-democracy voices in the regional media, it systematically leaves out intelligent criticism of Western-style democracy, US and Israeli policy and secularism. MEMRI has responded to the criticism, stating that their work is not biased; that they in fact choose representative articles from the Arab media that accurately reflect the opinions expressed, and that their translations are highly accurate.      Selectivity     Several critics have accused MEMRI of selectivity. They state that MEMRI consistently picks the most extreme views for translation and dissemination, which portray the Arab and Muslim world in a negative light, while ignoring moderate views that are often found in the same media outlets.  MEMRI argues that they are quoting the government-controlled press and not obscure or extremist publications, a fact their critics acknowledge, according to Marc Perelman  ""When we quote '' Al-Ahram '' in Egypt, it is as if we were quoting '' The New York Times ''. We know there are people questioning our work, probably those who have difficulties seeing the truth. But no one can show anything wrong about our translations."" MEMRI's rendition moved leading Liberal senator  Cory Bernardi  to write to the Police Commissioner charging that under Australia's  Anti-terrorism legislation#Australia anti-terrorism laws , the video clip was ""hate speech"", and requesting that action be taken against Hussein. The South Australian Islamic Society and the Australian Buddhist Councils Federation also condemned Hussein's speech. Widespread calls from the public for the deportation of Hussein and his family followed news reports of the video. A police spokeswoman stated ""Police will examine the entire content of the sermon to gain the full context and determine whether any crime has been committed."" Hussein himself declined any comment on the contents of the video. However, the Da'wah Centre charged that by omitting the context of Hussein's statements, MEMRI had distorted the actual intent of the speech.

The magazine was founded by the author  William F. Buckley Jr.  in 1955.     History         Background      Before ''National Review''s founding in 1955, the  American right  was a largely unorganized collection of people who shared intertwining philosophies but had little opportunity for a united public voice. They also wanted to marginalize what they saw as the  antiwar , noninterventionistic views of the  Old Right  United States  Old Right .      Early years     In 1953,  Russell Kirk  published ''The Conservative Mind'', which sought to trace an intellectual bloodline from  Edmund Burke   A magazine holding the trademark to the name prompted the change to ''National Review''.  The statement of intentions read   <blockquote>Let’s Face it  Unlike Vienna, it seems altogether possible that did ''National Review'' not exist, no one would have invented it. The launching of a conservative weekly journal of opinion in a country widely assumed to be a bastion of conservatism at first glance looks like a work of supererogation, rather like publishing a royalist weekly within the walls of Buckingham Palace. It is not that of course; if ''National Review'' is superfluous, it is so for very different reasons  It stands athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no other is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it.</blockquote>  As editors and contributors, Buckley especially sought out intellectuals who were ex-Communists or had once worked on the far Left, including Whittaker Chambers,  Willi Schlamm William Schlamm ,  John Dos Passos , Frank Meyer and James Burnham.  <blockquote>In the United States at this time liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition. For it is the plain fact that nowadays there are no conservative or reactionary ideas in general circulation... the conservative impulse and the reactionary impulse do not... express themselves in ideas but only... in irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas.</blockquote>  William Buckley Jr., on the purpose of ''National Review''   <blockquote>[''National Review''] stands athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no one is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it… it is out of place because, in its maturity, literate America rejected conservatism in favor of radical social experimentation…since ideas rule the world, the ideologues, having won over the intellectual class, simply walked in and started to…run just about everything. There never was an age of conformity quite like this one, or a camaraderie quite like the Liberals’.  The early ''National Review'' faced occasional defections from both left and right.   Garry Wills  broke with N.R. and became a liberal commentator. Buckley’s brother-in-law,  L. Brent Bozell Jr. , who ghostwrote ''The Conscience of a Conservative'' for Barry Goldwater, left and started the short-lived  traditionalist Catholic  magazine, '' Triumph  magazine  Triumph '' in 1966.      Defining the boundaries of conservatism      Buckley and Meyer promoted the idea of enlarging the boundaries of conservatism through  fusionism  politics  fusionism , whereby different schools of conservatives, including  libertarians , would work together to combat what were seen as their common opponents.  Buckley's goal was to increase the respectability of the conservative movement; as  Rich Lowry  noted  ""Mr. Buckley's first great achievement was to purge the American right of its kooks. He marginalized the anti-Semites, the John Birchers, the  Nativism  politics  nativists  and their sort."" In 1962 Buckley denounced  Robert W. Welch Jr.  and the  John Birch Society  as ""far removed from common sense"" and urged the  Republican Party  United States  Republican Party  to purge itself of Welch's influence.  In 1985, the National Review and Buckley were represented by attorney  J. Daniel Mahoney  during the magazine's $16 million libel suit against '' The Spotlight ''.  The magazine has been described as ""the bible of  conservatism in the United States American conservatism "". Since Trump's election to the presidency, the ''National Review'' editorial board has continued to criticize him. while ''National Review'' contributors such as Ramesh Ponnuru and Jonah Goldberg have remained critical of Trump.  Each day, the site posts new content consisting of conservative, libertarian, and neoconservative opinion articles, including some syndicated columns, and news features.  It also features two  blogs     '''The Corner''' – legal and judicial news and commentary   Markos Moulitsas , who runs the  Liberalism in the United States liberal  '' Daily Kos '' web-site, told reporters in August 2007 that he does not read conservative blogs, with the exception of those on N.R.O.  ""I do like the blogs at the ''National Review''—I do think their writers are the best in the [conservative] blogosphere,"" he said.  In 2019, the  Whittaker Chambers  family had NRI stop an award in Chambers' name following award to people whom the family found objectionable.     Finances    As with most political opinion magazines in the United States, ''National Review'' carries little corporate advertising. The magazine stays afloat by donations from subscribers and black-tie fund raisers around the country. The magazine also sponsors cruises featuring ''National Review'' editors and contributors as lecturers.     Presidential primary endorsements    ''National Review'' sometimes endorses a candidate during the primary election season. Editors at ''National Review'' have said, ""Our guiding principle has always been to select the most conservative viable candidate.""   1964   Barry Goldwater    1968   Richard Nixon    2012  no endorsement      Editors and contributors     The magazine's current editor-in-chief is  Rich Lowry . Many of the magazine's commentators are affiliated with think-tanks such as  The Heritage Foundation  and   American Enterprise Institute . Prominent guest authors have included  Newt Gingrich ,  Mitt Romney ,  Peter Thiel , and  Ted Cruz  in the on-line and paper edition.

The station is owned by the  Meredith Corporation . KMOV's studios are located at the Gateway Tower on Memorial Drive in  Downtown St. Louis , near the  Gateway Arch , and its  KMOV TV Tower transmitter  is located in  Lemay, Missouri Lemay . On  cable television cable , the station is available on  Spectrum  cable service  Charter Spectrum  channels 4   standard-definition television standard definition   and 704   high-definition television high definition  , and on  AT&T U-verse  channels 4  SD  and 1004  HD .    History       Early history    The station first signed on the air on July 8, 1954 as '''KWK-TV'''. At its launch, channel 4 was owned by a consortium which included Robert T. Convey  28%  and the  Advance Publications Newhouse Newspapers -published '' St. Louis Globe-Democrat ''  23% , who jointly operated KWK radio  1380 AM, now  KXFN  ; Elzey M. Roberts Sr., former owner of  KXOK  defunct  KXOK radio   630 AM, frequency now occupied by  KYFI  , which had to be sold as a condition of the license grant  23% ; and Missouri Valley Television Inc., made up of  Saint Paul, Minnesota Saint Paul ,  Minnesota -based  Hubbard Broadcasting   23%  and several St. Louis residents  combined 3% . Upon signing-on KWK-TV took the CBS affiliation from  Belleville, Illinois Belleville ,  Illinois -licensed WTVI  channel 54, now  KTVI  channel 2 . Until 1955, it also aired  American Broadcasting Company ABC  programs that WTVI declined to broadcast. The station's original studios, built by KWK radio in anticipation of television, were located on Cole Street in  Downtown West, St. Louis Downtown West . But after being approached with an offer, CBS decided in August of that year to buy KWK-TV instead for  United States dollar $ 4 million. Channel 4 moved from Cole Street into the new facility, known as One Memorial Drive, and remains there to the present day; the Cole Street studio was soon acquired by  KDNL-TV   channel 30 , which has operated from there since it signed-on in June 1969.  KMOX-TV was the host station for the  Miss Universe 1983 1983 Miss Universe Pageant , which was held at the now-demolished  Kiel Auditorium .     Viacom ownership    By late 1985, CBS was in rough financial straits, an after-effect of successfully fending off a  hostile takeover  attempt by  Ted Turner  the year before. CBS spent the latter portion of 1985 repurchasing a large portion of its stock to help block the Turner takeover. Once Turner sold his stock, CBS was saddled with significant debt and needed to raise money.     Changing hands    On June 13, 2013, the  Gannett Company , owner of  NBC  affiliate  KSDK   channel 5 , announced that it would acquire Belo. As the deal would violate FCC regulations that disallow common ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in a single  media market market   KMOV and KSDK have ranked as the top two stations in the St. Louis market in total-day ratings for several years , Gannett would retain KSDK, while it would spin off KMOV to Sander Media, LLC  owned by former Belo executive Jack Sander . Gannett intended to provide services to the station through a  local marketing agreement shared services agreement , KMOV's operations were to remain largely separate from KSDK, including separate and competing news and sales departments.  -   4.1     1080i     rowspan ""3""   16 9     KMOV-HD    Main KMOV programming / CBS  -   4.2    rowspan ""2""  480i     COZI-TV     Cozi TV     -   4.3    KMOV-My     MyNetworkTV   }  On February 17, 2014, KMOV dropped the  Live Well Network , as Meredith planned on using the bandwidth utilized from digital channel 4.3 for the station's  ATSC M/H   Mobile television mobile DTV  signal. In the 1990s, the primetime preemptions eased as all networks began to tighten down contractually on heavy preemptions, and currently, the station only occasionally preempts a CBS primetime show, usually only for breaking news reasons. The station also resumed a 24-hour broadcast schedule in the early 1990s.  From 1987 until September 11, 2015, KMOV aired '' The Young and the Restless '' on a same-day  broadcast delay delay  at 4 00&nbsp;p.m.  serving as a lead-in for its early-evening newscasts , with '' The Price Is Right  U.S. game show  The Price Is Right '' airing on a one-hour delay at 11 00&nbsp;a.m.; KMOV also delayed '' The Late Late Show  CBS TV series  The Late Late Show '' by a half-hour since 1997 under original host  Tom Snyder   one of several CBS stations that have done this practice , in order to run syndicated programming after the '' Late Show with David Letterman ''  KMOV completely preempted ''The Late Late Show'' during the program's first two years on the air . On September 14, 2015, KMOV moved ''The Price Is Right'', ''The Young and the Restless'' and ''The Late Late Show'' to their recommended network time periods with the first full season under Meredith ownership, with the relocation of the former two shows occurring as a result of the launch of a half-hour 4 00&nbsp;p.m. newscast. Connors filed a discrimination lawsuit against KMOV.  KMOX-TV led the ratings in St. Louis for most of the period from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, as was common with most of its CBS-owned sister stations. From the early 1980s until recently, KMOX-TV/KMOV was a solid, if distant, runner-up to KSDK. However until the mid-1990s, the station had to fend off spirited competition from KTVI. Although KMOV's newscasts were critically favored, they were rarely rewarded with a ratings win over long-dominant KSDK, with the 10 p.m. newscast regularly winning at least a 20% share in viewership, while KSDK averaged about a 30% share. KMOV has seen significant ratings growth since 2004, and beat KSDK at 10 p.m. both during the November 2004 sweeps period – the first time in over a quarter-century that KSDK did not place first in any timeslot – and during the May  Starting in late 2013, KMOV started to dominate the news ratings in most newscasts, winning the noon, 5 00, 6 00 and 10 00&nbsp;p.m. time slots, while KSDK plummeted to third place at 5 00 and 6 00&nbsp;p.m. for the first time in that station's history. Despite the firing of longtime anchor Larry Conners by the station in May 2013, KMOV has placed first among the market's 10 00&nbsp;p.m. newscast in every demographic every month since that time.  On January 27, 2008, beginning with its 5 30&nbsp;p.m. newscast, KMOV became the second television station in the St. Louis market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in  High-definition television high definition   after KSDK, which has produced its newscasts in the format since 2006 .

History   The Council on Foreign Relations, founded in the summer of 1921, primarily counted diplomats, financiers, scholars, and lawyers among its members. Its founding charter declared its purpose should be to ""afford a continuous conference on international questions affecting the United States, by bringing together experts on statecraft, finance, industry, education, and science.""     1922–1945    The lead article in the first issue of ''Foreign Affairs'' was written by former  United States Secretary of State Secretary of State  under  Theodore Roosevelt 's Administration,  Elihu Root . The article argued that the United States had become a  world power , and that as such the general population needed to be better informed about international matters.  John Foster Dulles , then a financial expert attached to the American Commission to Negotiate Peace, who would later become  United States Secretary of State Secretary of State  under  Dwight D. Eisenhower , also contributed an article to the inaugural issue of ''Foreign Affairs'' on Allied debt following World War I. by prominent  African American  intellectual  W. E. B. Du Bois . DuBois, a personal friend of Armstrong, wrote mainly about race issues and imperialism. Although in the early days of publication the journal did not have many female authors, in the late 1930s American journalist for '' Time  magazine  '' magazine  Dorothy Thompson  would contribute articles.  Eleven U.S.  U.S. Secretary of State Secretaries of State  have written essays in ''Foreign Affairs''.     1991–present    Since the end of the Cold War, and especially after the  September 11 attacks 9/11 attacks , the journal's readership has grown significantly. ''Foreign Affairs''' current total readership is 351,000 for the print magazine and it has 955,000 unique visitors per month for the website. In the article, Huntington argued that ""the fundamental source of conflict in this new world will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic. The great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of conflict will be cultural.""   File FA-WhoisKham123.jpg thumb The article ""Who is  Ali Khamenei Khamenei "" by  Akbar Ganji , which was published in the magazine's September/October 2013 issue, emphasized the view that the Supreme Leader is the primary decision maker in Iran.  Then-opposition leader and former  Ukraine Ukrainian   Prime Minister of Ukraine Prime Minister   Yulia Tymoshenko  caused a stir by publishing an article entitled ""Containing Russia"" in the May–June 2007 issue of ''Foreign Affairs'' accusing Russia under  Vladimir Putin  of expansionism and urging the rest of Europe to stand against him. Russian  List of Russian foreign ministers foreign minister   Sergei Lavrov  wrote an article in response, but he withdrew it, citing ""censorship"" from the ''Foreign Affairs'' editorial board. Tymoshenko's party went on to win the 2007 elections and she became Prime Minister once again.  In 2009, ''Foreign Affairs'' launched its new website, ForeignAffairs.com, which offers both print content and online-only features.    Book reviews   Since its inception, ''Foreign Affairs'' has included a long book review section, typically reviewing 50 or more books per issue. The magazine's first editor, Archibald Cary Coolidge, asked his Harvard colleague,  William L. Langer , a historian and  World War I  veteran, to run the section. Langer initially had full control over the magazine's book reviews and did all the reviews by himself. A month before the reviews were due, the ''Foreign Affairs'' office in New York would ship approximately one hundred books to Langer for review and within two weeks he would return his completed reviews for the next issue.  In the late 1930s, the review section was broken down into several categories. Currently, the ''Foreign Affairs'' reviews are broken down into long review essays, which are placed at the front of the books section, and the ""Recent Books"" section, where shorter reviewers are featured. The ""Recent Books"" section is further broken down into the following subject categories.    Political and Legal, reviewed by  G. John Ikenberry   Economic, Social, and Environmental, reviewed by  Richard N. Cooper   Military, Scientific, and Technological, reviewed by  Lawrence D. Freedman   The United States, reviewed by  Walter Russell Mead   Western Europe, reviewed by  Andrew Moravcsik   Western Hemisphere, reviewed by  Richard Feinberg   Eastern Europe and Former Soviet Republics, reviewed by  Robert Legvold   Middle East, reviewed by  John Waterbury   Asia and Pacific, reviewed by  Andrew J. Nathan   Africa, reviewed by  Nicolas van de Walle   The majority of the book reviews featured in the ""Recent Books"" section are reviewed by the same person; however, other reviewers contribute to the ""Recent Books"" section on occasion.     Influence    ''Foreign Affairs'' is considered an important forum for debate among academics and policy makers. In 1996, the Deputy Secretary of State,  Strobe Talbott , noted  ""Virtually everyone I know in the foreign policy-national security area of the Government is attentive to [''Foreign Affairs''].""

History   ''The Tele'', as it is also known, was founded in 1879. From 1936 to 1972, it was owned by  Sir Frank Packer 's  ACP Magazines Australian Consolidated Press . That year it was sold to News Limited  now  News Corp Australia  .  The paper ran as a  broadsheet  until 1927, when it switched to a  Tabloid  newspaper format  tabloid  format. The paper returned to a broadsheet format in 1931, but wartime paper restrictions saw it return to tabloid format in 1942.  In October 1990, it  Mergers and acquisitions merged  with its afternoon sister paper '' The Daily Mirror  Sydney  The Daily Mirror '' to form ''The Daily Telegraph-Mirror'' with morning and afternoon editions. The new paper continued in this vein until January 1996 when the paper name reverted to ''The Daily Telegraph'', in the process, removing the last vestige of the old ''Daily Mirror'', although the paper continued morning and afternoon editions until January 2002, when the afternoon edition was discontinued.  The circulation of the newspaper during the June quarter 2013 was 310,724 on weekdays,  The article mistakenly attributed the alleged crimes to the wrong individual, who subsequently filed a complaint of defamation in the New South Wales Discrict Court.  In the first instance, the Court found that, despite the serious errors in the article, the publisher's defence based on a prior offer of amends should prevail.  The Court awarded a sum of $150,000 to the complainant.      Reporting of Transgender Woman Accused of Violent Axe Attack     In January 2017, the Daily Telegraph published an article concerning a transgender woman subsequently convicted of a violent axe attack in a Sydney suburb. Although her transgender status was irrelevant to the incident at the time, The Daily Telegraph used derogatory slurs and made repeated references to the attacker's  history of sex reassignment surgery, calling the woman a ""tranny"" who ""had chopped herself"".  The following week,  Special Broadcasting Service SBS  published an article expressing concern about how journalists ""appear to enjoy treating transgender people as the punchline to a joke,"" singling out the Daily Telegraph's journalist.  The Tribunal found that the Daily Telegraph published the article with ""apparent disregard for the injurious effect it might have on transgender people."" The Tribunal also held that, ""it is evident that [the journalist] was seeking to make fun of Ms Amati and probably transgender people more generally,"" and that the ""attempt at humour was in poor taste and completely devoid of empathy or sensitivity.""  Continuing, the Tribunal also held that the article ""contributes to the perpetration and perpetuation of demeaning negative stereotypes and a lack of acceptance of transgender people within the community.""  The Tribunal ultimately concluded that, whilst ""close to the line"", the article did not reach the threshold for vilification.  As of September 2018, the article has been removed from the website of the Daily Telegraph and replaced with a notice stating ""This article is no longer available.""  The article contained an infographic that canvassed social health concerns, such as alcohol usage, obesity, and drug dependency, for which ""Young Aussies have only themselves to blame"".  The infographic included ""same sex attraction"" among the condemnable health problems it canvassed.  A number of  LGBT   LGBTI  Australians complained that the article was prejudicial, saying that sexual orientation is neither a choice nor a medical problem, and such coverage contributes to prejudice, shame and suicide risk for young same-sex attracted people.  The Daily Telegraph was further sanctioned by the Australian Press Council for failing to comply with the requirements around publication of adjudication findings.  The Press Council required the publisher to republish the print component of the adjudication as it was not fully compliant with its requirements in the first instance. The reprint was published on January 24, 2018.  The Daily Telegraph claimed that ""nothing sinister had occurred [in the non-compliance]"", and blamed the misdemeanour on a production error.  Editor  David Penberthy  claimed that his source was from inside the  Liberal Party of Australia Liberal Party  and that none of the events would have happened if no one leaked from inside the party. But for many, the headline highlighted problems with ''interpreting''  Higher School Certificate  New South Wales  Higher School Certificate  results and the accompanying TER. The published apology stated        Call centres in India     In October 2006, ''The Telegraph'' claimed in a front-page article that  Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ  were using call centres in  Bangalore , India. The paper even sent a journalist to Bangalore, Luke McIlveen, and a photographer to verify this claim.     Allegations of plagiarism    In 2002, former ''Telegraph'' journalist, Matt Sun, was accused of  plagiarism  by the TV program '' Media Watch  TV program  Media Watch ''.     Press Council complaint regarding series of misleading NBN articles    In June and July 2011, ''The Telegraph'' published a series of articles about the  National Broadband Network . These articles triggered a complaint to the  Australian Press Council , alleging that they were factually incorrect, unbalanced and misleading. In December 2011, the Press Council upheld the complaints on all three articles, forcing The Telegraph to publish the adjudication.      Press Council complaint regarding Mark Latham article  Sunday Telegraph     In December 2011, ''The Sunday Telegraph'' published two articles about former Labor leader Mark Latham and an alleged argument he had with his child's swimming teacher. Mr Latham complained to the  Australian Press Council  that there was a conflict of interest which should have been disclosed as the reporter was the daughter of one of the swim teachers at the school. Mr Latham also complained that the articles breached the privacy of his family, especially his young children, and were not in the public interest. The Press Council upheld the complaint and published the following statement  extract only    The Council also found that there had been an ""unreasonable intrusion on the children's privacy"" and upheld that aspect of the complaint.      Press Council complaint regarding series of Clover Moore articles    Throughout 2011, ''The Telegraph'' published 17 articles about Sydney Lord Mayor and MP Clover Moore. The articles prompted a complaint to the  Australian Press Council .

CIS opposes family-based migration, and instead advocates for a ""points system"" of immigration, based on professional skills, which Krikorian called ""a completely conventional idea"".  and 2009 <blockquote>The fact that they went after mainstream groups rather than fringe ones shows that the goal is not elevating the tone of public discourse but shutting it down altogether. ... The report's section on CIS is not just hackwork, but amateurish hackwork. Much of it dwells on letters written to  not by, but ''to''  one of my board members, misidentified as having been executive director. Our research is described as having been debunked by ""mainstream think tanks and organizations,"" oddly enough including two of the most strident open-borders advocacy groups in the nation. My tenure there, the majority of the center's existence, is dismissed briefly at the end as ""The Later Years."" And they didn’t even mention my book, which knits together decades of CIS research on the many facets of immigration into a unified theoretical framework – something at least worth touching on when trying to show how naughty CIS is. What's more, CIS is an unlikely source of  ""intolerance."" The chairman is  Peter Nuñez , U.S. attorney for San Diego under Reagan; the board includes the president of the Greater Miami Urban League and a former executive director of the  Congressional Black Caucus Foundation National Black Caucus Foundation ; the staff includes the former national policy director for the  American Jewish Committee ; and I didn't even speak English until I got to kindergarten.</blockquote>  Tanton also denied the SPLC's accusations. As to his alleged influence at CIS, he wrote, ""I also helped raise a grant in 1985 for the Center for Immigration Studies, but I have played no role in the Center's growth or development."" and senior research fellow at CIS, that was sharply critical of the SPLC, its tactics and methodologies, and its attacks against groups such as CIS, NumbersUSA, and FAIR.  Several months earlier, Krikorian denied allegations made in a similarly critical ''Wall Street Journal'' editorial In 2019, CIS sued the SPLC over the hate group designation in a  Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO  lawsuit, alleging that the designation was false and part of a ""smear campaign.""  Urban Institute   In March 2007, CIS issued a report saying that the ""proportion of immigrant-headed households using at least one major welfare program is 33 percent, compared to 19 percent for native households."" According to Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center, ""there are lots of methodological problems with the CIS study, mainly having to do with the limitations of small sample sizes and the fact that the estimates are determined by taking differences of differences based on small sample sizes."" An ICE spokesman said that many such releases were required by law, for instance when a detainee's home country refuses to accept them or required by a judge's order. The report was criticized on the basis of poor methodology by  Alex Nowrasteh  of the Cato Institute. Nowrasteh said that the report opted not to examine how much welfare immigrants use, but to examine households led by an immigrant so that the report could count the welfare usage of the immigrant's US-born children, which leads to a misleading estimate of immigrant welfare use. The CIS report was based on data from the 2016 National Academies of Science  NAS  report. The 18-member panel of economists, sociologists, demographers and public policy experts, and chosen by the National Academies of Science, concluded that undocumented immigrants had a net positive fiscal impact.

History    ''Canadian Dimension'' is Canada's longest standing magazine of the  left-wing politics left wing . For 50 years ''CD'' has provided a forum for debate, where red meets green, feminists take on socialists, socialists take on social democrats, whites hear from aboriginals, activists report from all corners of Canada, trade unionists report from the front lines, campaigns make connections, and the latest books, films, websites, CDs, and videos are radically reviewed. ''Canadian Dimension'' draws on a very wide spectrum of writers on the left. Some of the earliest contributors included  Charles Taylor  philosopher  Charles Taylor ,  George Grant  philosopher  George Grant ,  Gad Horowitz ,  C. B. Macpherson ,  Kari Polanyi Levitt Kari Levitt , John Warnock,  James Laxer ,  Leo Panitch  and Reg Whitaker. More recently, frequent contributors have included the likes of Bryan Palmer,  Sam Gindin ,  Andrea Levy , Peter Kulchyski,  Yves Engler ,  Joel Kovel ,  Ian Angus  activist  Ian Angus .  The magazine was founded in 1963 by  Cy Gonick , and a collective took over editorial responsibility in 1975. It is a diverse group of over 30 writers and activists who reside in major cities across Canada. Gonick acts as coordinating editor and publisher.  ''Canadian Dimension'' has always regarded itself as a socialist publication though the scope of its socialism has evolved very considerably. In 1963 it didn't write about feminism, the environment, human rights, gay and lesbian liberation, and the connection between the politics that's espoused and the way its proponents live their lives. By the 1980s these became standard fare.  An editorial written on the occasion of its 30th anniversary, ""CD at 30"" concluded that   Over the past decade, the format of the magazine changed radically with part of every issue being focused on a different theme&nbsp;– themes such as Cities, Indian Country, Arts and Politics, Food, Pensions in Peril, Queer, Remembering 1968, Immigration, the Criminal  Justice  System,  precarious work ,  big media , Canada mines the South, the  New Feminist Revolution ,  Our Winnipeg , Today's Student Activism,  climate change ,  peak oil ,  degrowth .

The Blade is often referred to as America's gay  newspaper of record because it chronicled LGBT news locally, nationally, and internationally.  The New York Times said the Blade is considered ""one of the most influential publications written for a gay audience.""The paper was originally launched as an independent publication in October 1969 with a focus on bringing the community together. In 2001, the Blade was purchased by Window Media LLC, a group of gay-oriented newspapers circulated throughout the United States with a staff composed of professional journalists, becoming a leading source of news for the readers both in Washington and around the nation. The paper publishes weekly on Fridays and celebrated its fortieth anniversary in October 2009.In November 2009, the Blade and several related publications, including the Southern Voice, were shut down after Window Media announced it was closing business.  After Blade staff members were told they no longer had jobs, plans were made for a new gay publication entitled DC Agenda, since the trademark for Washington Blade was still held by the now-defunct Window Media.It was announced on April 27, 2010 that the DC Agenda would rename itself to the Washington Blade.

It was reported on April 5, 2012, that Change.org hit 10 million members, and was the fastest-growing social action platform on the web. At that time, they were receiving 500 new petitions per day. In summer 2017, a petition on change.org called for  /r/incels   incel named after an abbreviation for "" inceldom involuntary celibate ""  to be banned for inciting violence against women. The petition collected over 57,000 signatures, and on January 26, 2012, the studio updated the website ""with the environmental message the kids had requested"".  In November 2013, someone calling himself "" John Doe "" of  Arlington, Texas  launched a petition against changes made to the  YouTube  commenting system by  Google . The changes force YouTube users to create an account on  Google+  and also removes the ""reply"" mechanism on comments unless they were posted on Google+. This petition received over 100,000 signatures in less than a week, and over 200,000 within two weeks. The petition garnered more than 241,000 signatures, but failed to change Google's stance on the matter. However, the changes to YouTube did not have the intended effect &ndash; namely, increasing spam instead of curbing it &ndash; and in mid-2015, the commenting system was altered to allow users to post comments without signing into Google+.  After the  United States presidential election, 2016 2016 United States presidential election , in which  Donald Trump  was declared  President-elect of the United States , there were  Protests against Donald Trump mass protests .

The petition gained over 500,000 signatures within 24 hours, making it the fastest growing petition to date for the site, while having the servers at Change.org in the UK regularly become unresponsive due to the high demand. In response to Centerplate not taking action after the incident other than releasing a statement of apology from Hague, and an agreement by Hague to commit to perform certain charitable acts, the petition called for Centerplate to fire Hague. On September 2, 2014, after the petition had received over 190,000 signatures, Hague resigned from his position as CEO of Centerplate.

Criticism       Fake signatures    In 2018, Anne Savage, the CEO of Bicycle Queensland, claimed that a massive Australian–based anti-cycling petition on Change.org was full of false names. She said Bicycle Queensland had received information that many of the names were created by electronic “bots”. A spokesperson for Change.org denied that the signatures were fake, saying that the organisation’s engineering team had double-checked the petition and confirmed they had not detected any unusual activity. signatures and other private information including email addresses can be found by search engines.

The discussion included senior defence journalist Ajai Shukla and The Wire’s M.K. Venu as participants, with national security analyst Happymon Jacob anchoring the show.  The lawsuit has been filed against The Wire’s founding editors and Shukla.  The Reliance Group and Anil Ambani feel that the said program is “false” and that statements made during the discussion are “wholly incorrect and misleading, made with a deliberate pre-determined motive to harm and injure the reputation” of both the company and its chairman.      Rajeev Chandrasekhar     Indian  Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament  Rajya Sabha   for the ruling  Bharatiya Janata Party Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP   and venture capitalist  Rajeev Chandrasekhar  accused ''The Wire'' of conspiring against him with the country's main opposition, the  Indian National Congress Congress Party , after the website published two articles suggesting that Chandrasekhar's major investments in the Indian media and defense industries might represent conflicts of interest with his role as a legislator. A BJP-led coalition had formed the government at the centre following their win in the  Indian general election, 2014 2014 Indian general election , and  Narendra Modi  had become the Prime Minister. The article alluded to possible irregularities in Jay Shah's business dealings, claiming that the turnover of a company owned by him increased 16,000 times over in the year following the election. Observing that “prima facie it seems there is a case” against ''The Wire'' for its defamatory article against Shah, a metropolitan court issued summons to the reporter of the article and editors of the website to appear before it on November 13 in the criminal defamation case filed against them. The order also mentions Shah's contention that “the news portal didn’t give enough time to him to send his response, the article didn’t include the loss incurred by his company in the year 2015-2016, and created confusion over the turnover to defame him.” However, the  Gujarat High court Gujarat High Court  later reinstated the gag order and refused to quash the criminal defamation case filed by Jay Shah.

Topics include British, European, and US politics, social issues, art, literature, cinema, science, the media, history, philosophy, and psychology. It features a mixture of lengthy analytic articles, first-person reportage, one-page columns, and shorter, quirky items. The magazine was launched in October 1995 by David Goodhart, then a senior correspondent for the Financial Times, and chairman Derek Coombs. Goodhart came up with the idea of producing an essay-based monthly general interest magazine—a form then unknown in Britain—while covering German reunification as Bonn correspondent for the FT. Contributors  include Lionel Shriver, A. C. Grayling, Gordon Brown, Mohamed ElBaradei, Michael Lind, Michael Ignatieff, Geoff Dyer, Francis Fukuyama, Roger Scruton, Andrew Marr, John Kay, and J. M. Coetzee. Notable features of the magazine include head-to-head debates between two writers with opposing views on a subject; roundtable discussions, in which a series of experts with varying views on a given topic meet for a discussion, an edited transcript of which is published in the magazine; and interviews with major political and cultural figures  examples include Orhan Pamuk, Paul Wolfowitz, and Hilary Mantel .  Prospect received worldwide attention in October 2005 when it published its list of the world's top 100 public intellectuals, which included Noam Chomsky, Umberto Eco, Richard Dawkins, Steven Pinker and Christopher Hitchens. The magazine asked readers to vote for their top intellectual from the longlist; Chomsky was the eventual winner. Subsequent lists have continued to attract attention. Dawkins claimed the top spot in 2013. Prospect has also published the winning short story of the Royal Society of Literature's V. S.

It is the result of the combination of two separate newspapers – the ''Waterbury American'' and the ''Waterbury Republican''.    History   The ''Waterbury American'' first appeared as a four-page, weekly newspaper, published by Josiah Giles on December 14, 1844.  Waterbury's first newspaper quickly grew in size and circulation and by 1850 it was the fourth largest newspaper in Connecticut.  On May 22, 1866 it became a daily newspaper published in the afternoon.  At first, the ''Republican'' was slow to gain circulation and was up against two other competitors in the city, but things changed the following year.  A massive fire in 1902 destroyed much of the downtown area of the city.  The extensive coverage given by the ''Waterbury Republican'' resulted in a huge increase in its circulation.  In 1924, the ''Republican'' and ''American'' began printing their Sunday comic pages in color and started selling their color printing services to other newspapers.  A few years later, Pape founded a separate company,  Eastern Color Printing Company , to oversee the color printing end of the business. In 1934, it produced what is considered the first modern comic book, named  Famous Funnies . It featured the adventures of  Mutt and Jeff , Donald Dare the Demon Reporter,  Buck Rogers  and other comic characters.  In 1990, the ''Republican'' and ''American'' were combined on the masthead of a single newspaper – the ''Republican-American'', published mornings six days a week.  The newspaper's reach extends far beyond Waterbury and covers more than 36 communities including Greater Waterbury, the  Naugatuck Valley , and  Litchfield County, Connecticut Litchfield County .  Municipalities and villages in the newspaper's coverage area include  Ansonia, Connecticut Ansonia ,  Beacon Falls, Connecticut Beacon Falls ,  Bethlehem, Connecticut Bethlehem ,  Bridgewater, Connecticut Bridgewater ,  Canaan, Connecticut Canaan ,  Cheshire, Connecticut Cheshire ,  Colebrook, Connecticut Colebrook ,  Cornwall, Connecticut Cornwall ,  Falls Village, Connecticut Falls Village ,  Goshen, Connecticut Goshen ,  Harwinton, Connecticut Harwinton ,  Kent, Connecticut Kent ,  Litchfield, Connecticut Litchfield ,  Middlebury, Connecticut Middlebury ,  Morris, Connecticut Morris ,  Naugatuck, Connecticut Naugatuck ,  New Hartford, Connecticut New Hartford ,  New Milford, Connecticut New Milford ,  North Canaan, Connecticut North Canaan ,  Oxford, Connecticut Oxford ,  Plymouth, Connecticut Plymouth ,  Prospect, Connecticut Prospect ,  Roxbury, Connecticut Roxbury ,  Salisbury, Connecticut Salisbury ,  Seymour, Connecticut Seymour ,  Sharon, Connecticut Sharon ,  Southbury, Connecticut Southbury ,  Terryville, Connecticut Terryville ,  Thomaston, Connecticut Thomaston ,  Torrington, Connecticut Torrington ,  Warren, Connecticut Warren ,  Washington, Connecticut Washington ,  Waterbury, Connecticut Waterbury ,  Watertown, Connecticut Watertown ,  Winchester, Connecticut Winchester ,  Winsted, Connecticut Winsted ,  Wolcott, Connecticut Wolcott , and  Woodbury, Connecticut Woodbury .

Four editors and reporters have been elected to the  .    Stated editorial stance   The ''Republican-American'' has a socially and fiscally conservative editorial stance. It advocates pro-business government policies, such as tax cuts and regulatory reform. The ''Republican-American'' is quick to blow the whistle on wasteful use of tax dollars, as well as unnecessary growth of local, state or federal government.  The newspaper is a frequent critic of the demands of organized labor, especially public-employee unions, arguing they compel governments and businesses to spend beyond their means.  The paper believes the United States should project strength on the world stage.  The newspaper asserts that if the US is not quick to forcefully denounce and, if necessary, take action against, aggressive and anti-democratic actions by anti-American regimes and groups, America’s enemies will be emboldened.  Because of its stance on the issues, the ''Republican-American'' is more inclined to endorse Republican candidates in election years. However, the paper is not hesitant to support Democrats who share its views or are uniquely qualified for the positions they seek. Senate candidate Ned Lamont of being a Stalinist,  The '' New Orleans Times-Picayune '' criticized the ''Republican-American'' in an editorial titled ""Yes, We're Worth It"", labeling the Waterbury paper ""heartless"" and asking ""How dare they?""

In 2010  Walter Isaacson , Chairman of the U.S. Government's  Broadcasting Board of Governors   which runs  Voice of America ,  Radio Free Europe  and  Radio Free Asia  , called for more money to invest into the programs because, ""We can't allow ourselves to be out-communicated by our enemies,"" mentioning specifically Russia Today,  Iran 's  Press TV  and  China 's  China Central Television   CCTV  in the next sentence. He later explained he actually was referring to ""enemies"" in  Afghanistan , not the nations he mentioned. on  Twitter , regarding allegations from RT Assange said that if Wikileaks had published Russian data, his relationship with RT might not have been so comfortable.  In 2018 some of the RT staff started a new media project '''Redfish.media''' that positions itself as ""grassroots journalism"". In 2012 Anna Kachkayeva, Dean of Media Communications at Moscow's Higher School of Economics, stated that they ""share the same roof"" because the two organizations are located in the same building, but regarding ""funding, editorial policy, management and staff, they are two independent organisations whose daily operations are not interconnected in any way."" According to a report on the RT website, the new news agency is ""in no way related"" to the news channel RT despite the similarity to RT's original name.

In 2011, RT was the second most-watched foreign news channel in the United States  after  BBC World News  ,  A  Pew Research  survey of the most popular news videos on  YouTube  in 2011-12, found RT to be the top source with 8.5 percent of posts. However of these, 68 percent consisted of first-person video accounts of dramatic worldwide events, likely acquired by the network rather than created by it. Between 2013 and 2015, more than 80% of RT's viewership was for videos of accidents, crime, disasters, and natural phenomena, such as the 2013  Chelyabinsk meteor Chelyabinsk meteor event , with less than 1% of viewership for political videos.  A study involving Professor Robert Orttung at  George Washington University  states that RT uses human interest stories without ideological content to attract viewers to its channels.

Cliff Kincaid, the director of  Accuracy in Media 's Center for Investigative Journalism, called RT ""the well-known disinformation outlet for Russian propaganda"".  In 2009,  Luke Harding   then Moscow correspondent for '' The Guardian ''  described RT's advertising campaign in the United Kingdom as an ""ambitious attempt to create a new post-Soviet global propaganda empire.""  In Russia,  Andrey Illarionov , former advisor to Vladimir Putin, has called the channel ""the best Russian propaganda machine targeted at the outside world"".   – RT has been banned in  Ukraine  since August 2014. Previously, the  United States Secretary of State   John Kerry  had referred to RT as a state-sponsored ""propaganda bullhorn"" and he continued by saying, "" network has deployed to promote president Putin's fantasy about what is playing out on the ground. They almost spend full-time devoted to this effort, to propagandize, and to distort what is happening or not happening in Ukraine."" Macron later said during a press conference that RT and Sputnik were ""agencies of influence and propaganda, lying propaganda—no more, no less"".  In November 2017,  Alphabet Inc. Alphabet  chairman  Eric Schmidt  announced that  Google  will be ""deranking"" stories from RT and Sputnik in response to allegations about election meddling by President Putin's government, provoking an accusation of  censorship  from both outlets.      Treatment of Putin and Medvedev      A 2007 article in ''The Christian Science Monitor'' wrote that RT reported on the good job Putin was doing in the world and next to nothing on things like the conflict in Chechnya or the murder of government critics.  Edward Lucas  journalist  Edward Lucas  wrote in '' The Economist ''  quoted in  Al Jazeera English   that the core of RT was ""anti-Westernism."" RT also have proliferated stories such as the  police brutality  in the US, the crack cocaine usage of Toronto mayor  Rob Ford , and the poverty among people of Arab descent in Western Europe.  According to Lithuania's STRATCOM Colonel, ""RT rarely takes a single, anti-Western media line on any given story. That would be too obvious. Instead, RT journalists present gaggles of competing and contradicting narratives which together create the impression that the truth is indecipherable"".  The launch of RT UK was the subject of much comment in the British press. In '' The Observer '',  Nick Cohen  accused the channel of spreading conspiracy theories and being a ""prostitution of journalism"" and in '' The Times '',  Oliver Kamm  called on broadcast regulator  Ofcom  to act against this ""den of deceivers"".  Journalists at '' The Daily Beast '' and '' The Washington Post '' have noted that RT employs Tony Gosling, an exponent of long-discredited theories concerning the alleged control of the world by  Illuminati  and the Czarist  Antisemitism antisemitic  forgery '' The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ''.      Israel–Palestine conflict     RT has been accused of being anti-Israel by Jewish and  Israel i sources, describing its reporting as being unbalanced. Israeli foreign minister  Avigdor Lieberman  made a complaint to Putin at their official meeting in 2012. According to '' Variety  magazine  Variety '', sources at RT confirmed that Dunbar had resigned, but rejected that it was over bias. One senior RT journalist told the magazine, ""the Russian coverage I have seen has been much better than much of the Western coverage... When you look at the Western media, there is a lot of genuflection towards the powers that be. Russian news coverage is largely pro-Russia, but that is to be expected."" An August 2013 story concerning unverified reports of the killing of 450  Kurds Kurdish  civilians near the Turkey-Syria border was also found to have breached Ofcom's rules. Later, Martin asserted that RT still supports her despite her differences of opinion with the Russian government. In a March 2014 ''Politico'' article, Wahl stated ""For about two and a half years. I’d looked the other way as the network smeared America for the sake of making the Kremlin look better by comparison, while it sugarcoated atrocities by one brutal dictator after another.""   ''The New York Times''  op-ed  columnist  Nicholas Kristof  commented on CNN's '' Piers Morgan Live '' about Wahl's and Martin's initial actions, ""admire their outspokenness but, you know, at the end of the day, RT is a Russian propaganda arm, and I don't think its going to matter very much to the geopolitical consequences here.""  Steve Bloomfield, the foreign editor of '' Monocle  lifestyle magazine  Monocle '' wrote that RT's ""coverage of Ukraine could not have been kinder to Moscow if Vladimir Putin had chosen the running order himself. While Putin kept up the pretence that there were no Russian troops in Crimea, so too did RT. The storming of government buildings across eastern Ukraine has been portrayed as the understandable actions of peace-loving protesters who fear ""chaos"" in Kiev"". Speaking of RT's coverage, Sarah Oates, professor of journalism at the  University of Maryland  said ""But if you’re going to engage in propaganda, you have to do it well. They have completely embarrassed themselves."" In follow-up interview she said ""In Ukraine, you’re taking a very small part of a much wider story, totally omitted the context of the story, and so what you wind up with on air is outright misinformation."" Calling RT ""mass information manipulation"" Firth said ""they have a very clear idea in their mind of what they’re trying to prove."" She also stated that ""The worst-kept secret is that RT is blatant propaganda. I’m one in a very long line of people who have left for the same reason."" For repeated breaches of its ''due impartially'' rules, Ofcom put RT management ""on notice that any future breaches of the due impartiality rules may result in further regulatory action, including consideration of a  Sanctions  law  statutory sanction "".  European Parliament  briefing notes on the situation called RT ""Russia's main international media weapon"". The counter-propaganda strategy subsequently developed by the EastStratCom Task Force, a small group of eight officials, included launching the ''EU vs Disinformation'' website with a headline of ""don't be deceived, question even more"".  In October 2015,  David J. Kramer , senior director for human rights and democracy at the  McCain Institute McCain Institute for International Leadership , suggested that Western countries freeze RT's assets ""not because of the odious things it spews"" but as part of the  Yukos shareholders vs. Russia Yukos shareholder case .  In July 2016, Ofcom again found RT in breach of its impartiality rules, this time over coverage of the Turkish government's treatment of  Kurds Kurdish people . Two episodes of ''Going Underground'' originally broadcast in March, included claims of attacks, atrocities and  genocide  against the Kurds, and that ""Turkey supports ISIS"" without offering adequate counterbalance. RT's representatives stated the network ""finds it especially difficult to obtain pro-Turkey views for its programming"" because of ""political tensions between Russia and Turkey following the downing of a Russian military aircraft by Turkish warplanes in November 2015"". The Post was criticized by '' The Intercept '', '' Fortune  magazine  Fortune '', and '' Rolling Stone '' for relying in part on an analysis by  PropOrNot , an anonymous organization with no reputation for fact-checking.  In December 2018, the British media regulator  Ofcom  ruled that seven programmes broadcast by RT between 17 March and 26 April of that year, in the wake of the  Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal Salisbury nerve agent attacks , had breached the UK's impartiality rules and that it was considering what sanctions to take; the BBC reported that RT was ""extremely disappointed by Ofcom's conclusions"". awarded RT's documentary ''People of the Bering Strait'' in the Ethnography and Travel category   June 2007 – The 11th ""Save and Preserve"" International Environmental Television Festival awarded RT with the Prize for Professional Skilfulness   November 2007 – RT's report on the anniversary of the  Chernobyl disaster Chernobyl catastrophe  received a special prize from the international 2007 AIB Media Excellence Awards   September 2008 – Russia's most prestigious broadcasting award  TEFI  to  Kevin Owen  in ''Best News Anchor'' category   August 2010 – First nomination for an  International Emmy Award  in News category for its coverage of president  Barack Obama 's trip to Russia.

It released a research report in June 2006 covering the portrayal of business on prime-time entertainment television during the May and November ""sweeps"" periods from 2005. The report concluded that the programs, among them the long-running  NBC  legal drama '' Law & Order '', were biased against business.  CNSNews.com provides news articles for  Townhall.com  and other websites for a subscription fee. Its leadership consists of president Brent Bozell and editor Terry Jeffrey. Under editor David Thibault, CNSNews.com questioned the validity of the circumstances in which Democratic Rep.  John Murtha  received his  Purple Heart s as a response to Murtha's criticisms of the U.S.  War in Iraq . '' The Washington Post '' and  Nancy Pelosi  have commented that this approach is similar to the tactics of the  Swift Vets and POWs for Truth , which opposed  John Kerry 's candidacy in the  U.S. presidential election, 2004 2004 election . Although the site is advertised chiefly as a conservative site, it frequently defends Neoconservatives as well.  Robert H. Knight  was the institute's first director. MRC VP Dan Gainor is now in charge of that department. In 2018, the MRC started a new project in the Culture Department to monitor online censorship of conservatives called MRC TechWatch.     MRCTV    MRC sponsors MRCTV  formerly Eyeblast , in the national news media, the MRC has produced a number of their own analyses and has offered as evidence the claims that news reporters use the ""conservative"" or ""Republican"" label to describe conservatives more often than they label liberals or Democrats. They have also said that when politicians are involved in scandal, their party affiliation is brought up more often when they are Republican than Democrat; for example, they have said that Senator  Robert Packwood 's Republican affiliation was brought up in most reports about his sexual scandals, but Representative  Gary Condit 's Democratic affiliation was ignored when he had the same problem, In 2003, the MRC urged advertisers to pull sponsorship from '' The Reagans '', a miniseries about President  Ronald Reagan  to be shown on  CBS . The network later moved the program to its co-owned premium cable network  Showtime  TV network  Showtime . During the  United States presidential election, 2008 2008 US presidential election , MRC released a report that claimed that the vast majority of news stories about Democratic presidential candidate  Barack Obama  had a positive slant.  Bozell was an outspoken critic of Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican primaries, describing him as ""the greatest charlatan of them all"", ""a “huckster” and “shameless self-promoter”.  Journalist Brian Montopoli of '' Columbia Journalism Review '' in 2005 labeled MRC ""just one part of a wider movement by the far right to demonize corporate media"", rather than ""make the media better.""  On June 31, 2013, Media Research Center president Bozell appeared on Fox News to defend a Fox interview in which Fox journalists conducted almost no research into the background of  Reza Aslan  to prepare for its interview with him, and its putative biases.  When the Media Research Center bestowed an award named for  William F. Buckley  to  Sean Hannity ,  Bret Stephens  wrote a column in '' The New York Times '' in which he lamented, ""And so we reach the Idiot stage of the conservative cycle, in which a Buckley Award for Sean Hannity suggests nothing ironic, much less  Orwellian , to those bestowing it, applauding it, or even shrugging it off.

As a  broadsheet , it was founded in 1964 as a successor to the '' Daily Herald  UK newspaper  Daily Herald ''; it became a tabloid in 1969 after it was purchased by its current owners. with a logo featuring a glowing orange disc. and had a circulation of 800,000.  Seizing the opportunity to increase his presence on Fleet Street, he made an agreement with the print unions, Lamb wanted Bernard Shrimsley to be his deputy, which Murdoch accepted as Shrimsley had been the second name on his list of preferences. An editorial on page 2 announced  ""Today's ''Sun'' is a new newspaper. It has a new shape, new writers, new ideas. But it inherits all that is best from the great traditions of its predecessors. ''The Sun'' cares. About the quality of life. About the kind of world we live in. And about people"". The first issue had an ""exclusive interview"" with the Labour Prime Minister,  Harold Wilson , on page 9. The first topless  Page 3  model appeared on 17 November 1970,  Stephanie Marrian Stephanie Rahn ; she was tagged as a ""Birthday Suit Girl"" to mark the first anniversary of the relaunched ''Sun''.  Politically, ''The Sun'' in the early Murdoch years remained nominally Labour-supporting. It advocated a vote for the  Labour Party  UK  Labour Party  led by  Harold Wilson  in the 1970 General Election, may have helped ''The Sun'' to overtake the ''Daily Mirror'' circulation in 1978.  The '' Daily Star  United Kingdom  Daily Star '' had been launched in 1978 by Express Newspapers, and by 1981 had begun to affect sales of ''The Sun''. So  Bingo  Commonwealth  bingo  was introduced as a marketing tool and a 2p drop in cover price removed the ''Daily Star''s competitive advantage opening a new circulation battle which resulted in ''The Sun'' neutralising the threat of the new paper.  ''The Sun'' became an ardent supporter of the  Falklands War . The coverage ""captured the zeitgeist"", according to  Roy Greenslade , assistant editor at the time  though privately an opponent of the war , but was also ""xenophobic, bloody-minded, ruthless, often reckless, black-humoured and ultimately triumphalist."" the newspaper published a photograph of a missile  actually a  UGM-27 Polaris Polaris missile  stock shot from the  Ministry of Defence  United Kingdom  Ministry of Defence   which had a large ''Sun'' logo printed on its side with the caption ""Here It Comes, Senors..."" underneath. At MacKenzie's insistence, and against the wishes of Murdoch  the mogul was present because almost all the journalists were on strike ,  The  satirical  magazine '' Private Eye  magazine  Private Eye '' mocked and lampooned what they regarded as the paper's  jingoistic  coverage, most memorably with the mock-''Sun'' headline ""KILL AN ARGIE, WIN A  Rover Metro METRO !"", to which MacKenzie is said to have jokingly responded, ""Why didn't we think of that?"" of the Labour Party by ''The Sun'' and other newspapers. During the  United Kingdom general election, 1983 general election of 1983  ''The Sun'' ran a front page featuring an unflattering photograph of  Michael Foot , then aged almost 70, claiming he was unfit to be Prime Minister on grounds of his age, appearance and policies, alongside the headline ""Do You Really Want This Old Fool To Run Britain?"" The story, which appeared on the day of the  Chesterfield by-election, 1984 Chesterfield byelection  in which Benn was standing, was discredited when the psychiatrist quoted by ''The Sun'' publicly denounced the article and described the false quotes attributed to him as ""absurd"", ''The Sun'' having apparently fabricated the entire piece. The newspaper made frequent scathing attacks on what the paper called the "" loony left "" element within the Labour Party ''The Sun'' strongly supported the April 1986 bombing of  Libya  by the US, which was launched from British bases. Several civilians were killed during the bombing. Their leader was ""Right Ron, Right Maggie"".       Murdoch's response      Murdoch has responded to some of the arguments against the newspaper by saying that critics are ""snobs"" who want to ""impose their tastes on everyone else"", while MacKenzie claims the same critics are people who, if they ever had a ""popular idea"", would have to ""go and lie down in a dark room for half an hour"". Both have pointed to the huge commercial success of the ''Sun'' in this period and its establishment as Britain's top-selling newspaper, claiming that they are ""giving the public what they want"". This conclusion is disputed by critics.  John Pilger  has said that a late-1970s edition of the ''Daily Mirror'', which replaced the usual celebrity and domestic political news items with an entire issue devoted to his own front-line reporting of the  Cambodian genocide genocide in Pol Pot's Cambodia , not only outsold ''The Sun'' on the day it was issued but became the only edition of the ''Daily Mirror'' to ever sell every single copy issued throughout the country, something never achieved by ''The Sun''.  In January 1986 Murdoch shut down the Bouverie Street premises of ''The Sun'' and ''News of the World'', and moved operations to the new  Wapping  complex in East London, substituting the electricians' union for the print unions as his production staff's representatives and greatly reducing the number of staff employed to print the papers; a year-long  picketing  protest  picket  by sacked workers was eventually defeated  see  Wapping dispute  .       ""Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster""       File Freddiehamster.jpg thumb left upright ""Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster"", 13 March 1986  During this period, ''The Sun'' gained a reputation for running sensationalistic stories with questionable veracity. On 13 March 1986, the newspaper published one of its best known headlines  ""FREDDIE STARR ATE MY HAMSTER"".  The story alleged that British comedian  Freddie Starr , while staying at the home of a writer and old friend of his named Vince McCaffrey and his partner Lea LaSalle In his 2001 autobiography ''Unwrapped'', Starr wrote that the incident was a complete fabrication  ""I have never eaten or even nibbled a live hamster, gerbil, guinea pig, mouse, shrew, vole or any other small mammal.""  Eventually resulting in 17 libel writs in total, ''The Sun'' ran a series of false stories about the pop musician  Elton John  from 25 February 1987. He also recalls MacKenzie headlining a January 1989 story about the first same-sex kiss on the BBC television soap opera '' EastEnders '' ""EastBenders"",       AIDS      ''The Sun'' responded to the health crisis on 8 May 1983 with the headline  ""US Gay Blood Plague Kills Three in Britain"".  Critics stated that both ''The Sun'' and Lord Kilbracken  Cherry picking  fallacy  cherry-picked  the results from one specific study while ignoring other data reports on HIV infection and not just AIDS infection, which the critics viewed as unethical politicisation of a medical issue. Lord Kilbracken himself criticised ''The Sun'' editorial and the headline of its news story; he stated that while he thought that gay people were more at risk of developing AIDS it was still wrong to imply that no one else could catch the disease. The  Press Council  UK  Press Council  condemned ''The Sun'' for committing what it called a ""gross distortion"". ''The Sun'' later published an apology, which they ran on Page 28. Journalist  David Randall  argued in the textbook ''The Universal Journalist'' that ''The Sun'' story was one of the worst cases of journalistic malpractice in recent history, putting its own readers in harm's way.   File The Sun Liverpool.jpg thumb upright Poster urging the Liverpool public not to purchase ''The Sun''  At the end of the decade, ''The Sun''s coverage of the Hillsborough football stadium disaster in  Sheffield  on 15 April 1989, in which 96 people died as a result of their injuries, proved to be, as the paper later admitted, the ""most terrible"" blunder in its history. Despite the headline, written by  Kelvin MacKenzie , the story was based on allegations either by unnamed and unattributable sources, or hearsay accounts of what named individuals had said – a fact made clear to MacKenzie by Harry Arnold, the reporter who wrote the story.        Later repercussions       On 7 July 2004, in response to verbal attacks in Liverpool on  Wayne Rooney , just before his transfer from  Everton F.C. Everton  to  Manchester United F.C. Manchester United , who had sold his life story to ''The Sun'', the paper devoted a full-page editorial to an apology for the ""awful error"" of its Hillsborough coverage and argued that Rooney  who was only three years old at the time of Hillsborough  should not be punished for its ""past sins"". In January 2005, ''The Sun'' managing editor  Graham Dudman  admitting the Hillsborough coverage was ""the worst mistake in our history"", added  ""What we did was a terrible mistake. It was a terrible, insensitive, horrible article, with a dreadful headline; but what we'd also say is  we have apologised for it, and the entire senior team here now is completely different from the team that put the paper out in 1989.""  On 12 September 2012, following the publication of the official report into the disaster using previously withheld Government papers which officially  exonerated  the Liverpool fans present, MacKenzie issued the following statement    Trevor Hicks, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, rejected Mr MacKenzie's apology as ""too little, too late"", calling him "" lowlife , clever lowlife, but lowlife"".   Liverpool FC supporters and a significant majority of the City of Liverpool's residents have continued to boycott the newspaper as a result of the Hillsborough tragedy. Access to the club grounds and facilities for ''Sun'' reporters were blocked. The  Mayor of Liverpool   Joe Anderson  politician  Joe Anderson  described the article as ""disgrace"" and a ""slur"" on the city.  ''The Sun'' remained loyal to Thatcher right up to her resignation in November 1990, A month later, on 14 October, it attacked  Michael Heseltine  for the mass coal  mine closure s.  Despite its initial opposition to the closures, until 1997, the newspaper repeatedly called for the implementation of further Thatcherite policies, such as  Royal Mail  privatisation, It also gradually expressed its bitter disillusionment with John Major as Prime Minister, with leaders such as ""What fools we were to back John Major"".  On 22 January 1997, ''The Sun'' accused the shadow chancellor  Gordon Brown  of stealing the Conservatives' ideas by declaring, ""If all he is offering is Conservative financial restraint, why not vote for the real thing?"" John Major's Conservatives, it said, were ""tired, divided and rudderless"". Cabinet Minister  Peter Mandelson  was ""outed"" by  Matthew Parris   a former ''Sun'' columnist  on BBC TV's '' Newsnight '' in November 1998. Misjudging public response, ''The Sun'' editor David Yelland demanded to know in a front-page editorial whether Britain was governed by a ""gay mafia"" of a ""closed world of men with a mutual self-interest"". Three days later the paper apologised in another editorial which said ''The Sun'' would never again reveal a person's sexuality unless it could be defended on the grounds of ""overwhelming public interest"".  In 2003, the paper was accused of racism by the government over its criticisms of what it perceived as the ""open door"" policy on immigration. The attacks came from the Prime Minister's press spokesman  Alastair Campbell  and the Home Secretary  David Blunkett   later a ''Sun'' columnist . The paper rebutted the claim, believing that it was not racist to suggest that a ""tide"" of unchecked illegal immigrants was increasing the risk of terrorist attacks and infectious diseases. It did not help its argument by publishing a front-page story on 4 July 2003, under the headline ""Swan Bake"", which claimed that asylum seekers were slaughtering and eating swans. It later proved to have no basis in fact. Subsequently, ''The Sun'' published a follow-up headlined ""Now they're after our fish!"". Following a  Press Complaints Commission  adjudication a ""clarification"" was eventually printed, on page 41.

Wade had tried to persuade  David Yelland  journalist  David Yelland , her immediate predecessors in the job, to scrap the feature, but a model who shared her first name was used on her first day in the post.  ''The Sun'' has been openly antagonistic towards other European nations, particularly the French and Germans. During the 1980s and 1990s, the nationalities were routinely described in copy and headlines as ""frogs"", ""krauts"" or ""hun"". As the paper is opposed to the EU it has referred to foreign leaders who it deemed hostile to the UK in unflattering terms. Former President  Jacques Chirac  of France, for instance, was branded ""le Worm"". An unflattering picture of German chancellor  Angela Merkel , taken from the rear, bore the headline ""I'm Big in the Bumdestag""  17 April 2006 .  Although ''The Sun'' was outspoken against the racism directed at  Bollywood  actress  Shilpa Shetty  on television reality show '' Celebrity Big Brother 5  UK  Celebrity Big Brother '' during 2007, the paper captioned a picture on its website, from a Bollywood-themed pop video by  Hilary Duff , ""Hilary  Papadum PoppaDuff "",  On 9 December 2010, ''The Sun'' published a front-page story claiming that terrorist group  Al-Qaeda  had threatened a terrorist attack on  Granada Television  in Manchester to disrupt the episode of the soap opera '' Coronation Street '' to be transmitted  Coronation Street  50th anniversary live episode live  that evening. The paper cited unnamed sources, claiming ""cops are throwing a ring of steel around tonight's live episode of ''Coronation Street'' over fears it has been targeted by Al-Qaeda."" where News International had built what is claimed to be the largest printing centre in Europe with 12 presses. The site also produces '' The Times '' and '' The Sunday Times Sunday Times '', '' The Daily Telegraph Daily Telegraph '' and '' The Sunday Telegraph Sunday Telegraph '', '' The Wall Street Journal Europe Wall Street Journal Europe ''  also a Murdoch newspaper , the '' London Evening Standard '', and local papers. Northern printing had earlier been switched to a new plant at Knowsley on Merseyside and the ''Scottish Sun'' to another new plant at Motherwell near Glasgow. The three print centres represent a £600&nbsp;million investment by NI and allowed all the titles to be produced with every page in full colour from 2008. The Waltham Cross plant is capable of producing one million copies an hour of a 120-page tabloid newspaper.  In early 2011, the company vacated the Wapping complex, which in November 2011 was put on the market for a reputed £200&nbsp;million. In May 2012, it was reported the Wapping site had been sold for £150&nbsp;million to St George, part of  Berkeley Group Holdings .  With "" Broken Britain "" controversies on issues like crime, immigration and public service failures in the news, on 30 September 2009, following Brown's speech at the Labour Party Conference, ''The Sun'', under the banner ""Labour's Lost It"", announced that it no longer supported the Labour Party  One attack on Gordon Brown backfired at around this time. After criticising him for misspelling a dead soldier's mother's name, ''The Sun'' was then forced to apologise for misspelling the same name on their website. Several days later the ''Independent'' reported ''The Sun'' failure to report its own  YouGov  poll result which said that ""if people thought Mr Clegg's party had a significant chance of winning the election"" the  Liberal Democrats  UK  Liberal Democrats  would win 49% of the vote, and with it a landslide majority.  On 24 August 2012, ''The Sun'' sparked a controversy when it published photos of  Prince Harry  taken in a private situation with friends while on holiday in  Las Vegas Valley Las Vegas , USA. While other British newspapers had not published the photos in deference to the privacy of members of the  British Royal Family Royal Family , editorial staff of ''The Sun'' claimed it was a move to test Britain's perception of freedom of the press. In the photos, which were published on the Internet worldwide, Prince Harry was naked. The internet URLs ''sunonsunday.co.uk'', ''thesunonsunday.co.uk'' and ''thesunonsunday.com'' were registered on 5 July 2011 by News International Newspapers Limited.  A reporter working for ''The Sun'' was arrested and taken to a south-west London police station on 4 November 2011. The man was the sixth person to be arrested in the UK under the News International related legal probe,  Operation Elveden . as part of a probe in which journalists paid police officers for information; a police officer was also arrested in the probe. The ''Sun'' staffers arrested were crime editor Mike Sullivan, head of news Chris Pharo, former deputy editor Fergus Shanahan, and former managing editor Graham Dudman, who since became a columnist and media writer. All five arrested were held on suspicion of corruption. Police also searched the offices of News International, the publishers of ''The Sun'', as part of a continuing investigation into the ''News of the World'' scandal.  Coinciding with a visit to ''The Sun'' newsroom on 17 February 2012, Murdoch announced via an email that the arrested journalists, who had been suspended, would return to work as nothing had been proved against them.       World Cup 2014 free issue      On 12 and 13 June 2014, to tie in with the beginning of the  2014 FIFA World Cup 2014 World Cup  football tournament, a free special issue of ''The Sun'' was distributed by the  Royal Mail  to 22 million homes in England. Royal Mail employees in Merseyside and surrounding areas were given special dispensation by their managers to allow them not to handle the publication ""on a case by case basis"". Miliband's decision to pose with a copy of  ''The Sun'' received a strong response. The front page read  ""Tulisa's cocaine deal shame""; this story was written by ''The Sun On Sunday''s undercover reporter  Mahzer Mahmood , who had previously worked for the ''News of the World''. It was claimed that Tulisa introduced three film producers  actually Mahmood and two other ''Sun'' journalists  to a drug dealer and set up a £800 deal. Tulisa was cleared of supplying  Drugs controlled by the UK Misuse of Drugs Act Class A drugs . After these events, ''The Sun'' released a statement saying that the newspaper ""takes the Judge's remarks very seriously. Mahmood has been suspended pending an immediate internal investigation."" On 16 January 2015, Troup and Edwards were cleared by the jury of all charges against them. The jury also partially cleared O'Driscoll and Dudman but continued deliberating over other counts faced by them, as well as the charges against Pharo and Pyatt.  In a separate trial, ''Sun'' reporter Nick Parker was cleared on 9 December 2014 of aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office but found guilty of handling a stolen mobile phone belonging to Labour MP  Siobhain McDonagh .  The BBC reported that France was the first journalist to face trial and be convicted under Operation Elveden since the Crown Prosecution Service  CPS  had revised its guidance in April 2015 so that prosecutions would only be brought against journalists who had made payments to police officers over a period of time. As a result of the change in the CPS' policy, charges against several journalists who had made payments to other types of public officials – including civil servants, health workers and prison staff – had been dropped. To mark the feature's 40th anniversary, feminist author  Germaine Greer  wrote an article in ''The Sun'' on 18 November 2010 published under the headline  ""If I ask my odd-job man what he gets out of page 3, he tells me simply, 'It cheers me up'"". The main newspaper was reported to have followed in 2015 with the edition of 16 January supposedly the last to carry such photographs after a report in '' The Times '' made such an assertion.       Accusations of xenophobia      On 17 April 2015, ''The Sun'' columnist  Katie Hopkins  called  Immigration migrants  to Britain ""cockroaches"" and ""feral humans"" and said they were ""spreading like the norovirus"". A joint complaint was made to the  Independent Press Standards Organisation  by the  Board of Deputies of British Jews ,  Tell MAMA  and Faith Matters. A statement by the groups said ""The printing of the phrase 'The Muslim Problem' – particularly with the capitalisation and italics for emphasis – in a national newspaper sets a dangerous precedent, and harks back to the use of the phrase 'The  Jewish problem  in the last century, to which the Nazis responded with 'The  Final Solution ' – the  Holocaust "".  ''The Sun'' officially endorsed the Leave campaign in the British  United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016 referendum to remain in or leave  the  European Union  on 23 June 2016, urging its readers to vote for the United Kingdom to leave the EU.       Website redesign      In June 2016, a redesign of ''The Sun'' website was launched.    Circulation   ''The Sun'' dominated the circulation figures for daily newspapers in the United Kingdom since the late 1970s, at times easily outpacing its nearest rivals, the ''Daily Mirror'' and the ''Daily Mail''. For a brief period in the late 1990s and early 2000s this lead was more than a million copies per day. Sustained decline began in 2004, in line with print journalism as a whole, and in the six-year period from 2012-18 it lost more than a million copies from its daily figures. ''The Sun'''s long run at the top was finally broken in February 2018 when it was announced that the circulation of the free ''Metro'' newspaper had overtaken it for the first time. However it remains the biggest-selling newspaper in the UK.    Tony Gallagher   2015–present  The ''Scottish Sun'' voiced its support for the SNP in the  Scottish Parliament general election, 2011 2011 parliamentary election .  At the  2015 United Kingdom general election 2015 general election , ''The Scottish Sun'' urged its readers to back the SNP. While in England and Wales, the paper saw a vote for the Conservatives as a means to ""stop [the] SNP running the country"", the edition north of the border said the SNP would ""fight harder for Scotland's interests at Westminster"". The Republic of Ireland edition shares some content – namely glamour and showbiz – with the editions published in Great Britain, but has mainly Irish news and editorial content, as well as sport and advertising.  It often views stories in a very different light to those being reported in the UK editions. Editions of the paper in Great Britain described the film '' The Wind That Shakes the Barley  film  The Wind That Shakes the Barley ''  2006  as being ""designed to drag the reputation of our nation through the mud"" and ""the most pro-IRA ever"";  There is also an Irish edition of the ''Sun on Sunday'', the ''Irish Sun on Sunday'', which launched in February 2012.      ''Polski Sun''     ''Polski Sun'' was a Polish-language version of the newspaper which ran for six issues in June 2008 during the  UEFA Euro 2008  football tournament, on the days of and the days after Poland played matches. Each issue had a circulation of 50,000–75,000, in relation to the estimated 600,000 Poles in the United Kingdom at the time.

The newspaper has been owned by  Lee Enterprises  since 1959. The ''Missoulian'' is the largest published newspaper in western  Montana . The ''Missoulian'' is distributed throughout the city of  Missoula, Montana , and also throughout most of  Western Montana .     History       Early years    The ''Missoulian'' was established as the ''Missoula & Cedar Creek Pioneer'' on September 15, 1870, by the Magee Brothers and I. H. Morrison under the Montana Publishing Company.  Though strictly conservative politically, the paper was never intended to advance any particular ""clique or party"".  Daly's election maneuvering created a major rift between the Copper Kings, and the next year he would become chairman of the Montana Democratic Party.  He asked for Hammond's support and Hammond responded by delivering a Republican sweep of the Missoula delegation.  This infuriated Daly, who declared war on Hammond and threatened to ""make grass grow in the streets of Missoula.""  Several years later as Montana's press was divided on whether to keep the state's capital in Clark's choice of  Helena, Montana Helena  or move it Daly's company town of  Anaconda, Montana Anaconda , Hammond who was worried that further empowered Daly would weaken Missoula loaned ''The Missoulian'' to Clark's team who derided Anaconda.  ""What has Anaconda ever done for Missoula, anyway? If Christ came to Anaconda he would be compelled to eat, sleep, drink and pray with Marcus Daly.""  Though the majority of Missoula County voted for Anaconda as capital, enough voted for Helena for it to win the statewide contest. Dixon gained control over the paper in 1907 and brought in Arthur Stone, a former ''Anaconda Standard'' reporter and managing editor as well as former Democratic state legislator, as editor.  His experience would help further modernize the paper and expand its reach.  After his election defeat Dixon turned the Missoulian against Amalgamated with scathing editorials and ""objectionable"" news.  With Dixon refusing to sell the paper, the Company chose bribery by offering Dixon the ''Missoula Sentinel'' that Dixon felt was splitting the city's advertising dollars.  Dixon accepted, but only on the condition that he would be ""fair"" to Amalgamated in the press.  Pressure on advertisers for new anti-Dixon competition and Amalgamated itself pulling its advertising dollars as well as having the  Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Milwaukee Road  cancel complimentary papers that it had given to passengers, however, forced Dixon to sell.  In two newspapermen from the ''Chicago Journal'', Martin Hutchens and Lester L. Jones purchased the Missoulian and was soon part of the ""copper press""  i.e. a ""Company paper"" known for using its pages to promote the Company's views and for suppressing news it didn’t want reported  and would remain as such until Anaconda Copper sold all its Montana newspapers to  Lee Enterprises  in 1959.  ''The Weekly Missoulian'' continued for a year  January 1899 – April 1900  as ''The Missoulian''  still as a weekly newspaper , published by Bryan Bros. & Hauck.  The weekly newspaper was then purchased by the Fruit-Grower Publishing Company and existed as a horticulture and general news publication until the mid-1910s.  In 1889 Harrison Spaulding founded ''The Morning Missoulian'' as a daily  minus Monday  paper to compliment ''The Weekly Missoulian''.  By 1893, this was changed to ''The Evening Missoulian'' and then to the ''Daily Missoulian'' under the Missoula Publishing Company with Harrison Spaulding as editor.  After brief separate ownership, both the daily and weekly ''Missoulian''s were reclaimed by the Missoula Publishing Company with ''The Daily Missoulian'' lasting until 1961, when it was once again called the ''Missoulian'' after being purchased by  Lee Enterprises .

From mid-2007 to mid-2008, MSNBC enjoyed a large increase in its  Nielsen ratings . Olbermann and Matthews, however, were criticized for expressing left-leaning opinions on the channel. Both were later removed from their anchor positions. The show regularly outperformed CNN's '' Larry King Live '', and made the channel competitive in the program's time slot for the first time in over a decade. The channel also beat CNN in total adult viewers in March, marking the seventh out of the past eight months that MSNBC achieved that result. The network also beat CNN for the fourth consecutive quarter, among both primetime and total viewers, as well as becoming the only cable news network to have its key adult demographic viewership grow over the last quarter, increasing by 4 percent. During this time, MSNBC also became the number-one cable news network in primetime among both African American and Hispanic viewers. The new campaign embraces the network's politically progressive identity.     Return to hard news and alignment with NBC News  since 2015     To help revive the struggling network, MSNBC in the summer of 2015 started transitioning from left-leaning, opinionated programming to hard news programming. Nearly all daytime opinionated news programs were replaced with more generic news programs.  Ronan Farrow ,  Joy-Ann Reid ,  Krystal Ball ,  Touré ,  Abby Huntsman ,  Alex Wagner ,  Ed Schultz , and  Al Sharpton  lost their shows. News programs presented by established NBC News personalities such as  Telemundo  anchor  Jose Diaz-Balart , '' Meet the Press '' anchor  Chuck Todd , Sunday NBC Nightly News anchor  Kate Snow ,  Thomas Roberts  television journalist  Thomas Roberts , and former NBC Nightly News anchor  Brian Williams  replaced the opinion shows.  In July 2016, the network debuted ''Dateline Extra'', which was an abridged version of '' Dateline NBC '' and another step towards aligning MSNBC and NBC News. The new program was hosted by ''MSNBC Live'' anchor  Tamron Hall .  In January 2017, MSNBC debuted a program in the 6 pm EST hour entitled '' For the Record with Greta '', hosted by former Fox News Channel anchor  Greta Van Susteren . In May 2017, MSNBC launched a 4pm afternoon program entitled '' Deadline  White House '' and hosted by former White House communications director and NBC political analyst  Nicolle Wallace .   For the first time, MSNBC in May 2017 became the highest rated American cable news network in primetime. MSNBC's increasing viewership was accompanied by declining numbers at Fox News Channel. MSNBC's May 15–19 programming topped the programming of both CNN and Fox News in total viewers and the advertiser-coveted younger demographic.

One of several reasons for this was an exclusive carriage agreement between MSNBC and Cablevision that prohibited competing wired providers from carrying MSNBC. After entering into a new contract, FiOS added the channel in New York City and New Jersey on February 2, 2010.      Middle East and North Africa    MSNBC programming is shown for most of the day on the 24-hour news network  OSN News .     Europe and Asia    In Asia and Europe, MSNBC is not shown on a dedicated channel. When MSNBC started in 1996, they announced plans to start broadcasting in Europe during 1997. This never happened. However MSNBC has been seen occasionally on affiliate channel CNBC Europe.     Online     File MSNBC.com Turns 10.jpg thumb left MSNBC celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2006.

Unlike the network, msnbc.com was operated as the general online news outlet of NBC News in partnership with Microsoft's  MSN.com  portal. The network and website also remained editorially separate. The website did not adopt the network's increasingly liberal viewpoints and remained a joint venture with Microsoft even after it had sold its stake in MSNBC.     Shift      In July 2014, msnbc.com launched ''msnbc2'', a brand for several web-only series hosted by MSNBC personalities. This is the second time MSNBC has been available on satellite radio. The channel was dropped from XM Radio on September 4, 2006.    Criticism and controversy        Liberal bias      In November 2007, a ''New York Times'' article stated that MSNBC's primetime lineup was tilting more to the left. In 2007, ''The New York Times'' called Olbermann MSNBC's ""most recognizable face"".  In October 2010, MSNBC began using the tagline ""Lean Forward"". Some media outlets, including msnbc.com, claimed that the network was now embracing its politically progressive identity.  In November 2012, ''The New York Times'' called MSNBC ""The Anti-Fox"" and quoted former President Bill Clinton as saying, ""Boy, it really has become our version of Fox.""  Others have argued that MSNBC has a bias against progressive politics.  Phil Donahue 's show was canceled in 2003 due to his opposition to the Iraq War, and Donahue later commented that the management of MSNBC required that ""we have two conservative  guests  for every liberal. I was counted as two liberals."" criticized MSNBC during and after the  Democratic Party  United States  presidential primaries, 2008 2008 Democratic Party primaries  as covering  Barack Obama  more favorably than  Hillary Clinton . Rendell said, ""MSNBC was the official network of the Obama campaign,"" and called their coverage ""absolutely embarrassing"". MSNBC's on-air slogan during the week of the 2008 presidential election, ""The Power of Change"", was criticized for being too similar to Obama's campaign slogan of ""Hope and Change"".      ''Rise of the New Right'' documentary     In June 2010, the MSNBC documentary ''Rise of the New Right'' aired. It featured interviews with  Right-wing figure right-wing  figures, including  Dick Armey , the former House majority Leader,  Orly Taitz , a leading figure in the "" birther "" movement, and  conspiracy theorist  radio host  Alex Jones  radio host  Alex Jones . The documentary also showed the  Michigan Militia 's  Survivalism survival  training camp and hit the campaign trail with Kentucky senatorial candidate  Rand Paul . On the other hand, their coverage of Barack Obama improved in the final week before the presidential election. From October 1 to 28, 33 percent of stories were positive and 13 percent negative. During the campaign's final week, 51 percent of MSNBC's stories were positive while there were no negative stories at all about Obama in the sample.     Romney family grandchild     Political commentator  Melissa Harris-Perry  and her guest panel, in a look back on the 2013 segment of  Melissa Harris-Perry  TV program  her show , featured a picture of former Republican presidential candidate  Mitt Romney  and his extended family. Romney was holding on his knee his adopted grandchild, Kieran Romney, an African-American. Harris-Perry and her guests, including actress Pia Glenn and comedian  Dean Obeidallah , joked about coming up with captions for the photo. Glenn sang out, ""One of these things is not like the others, one of these things just isn’t the same."" Obeidallah said, ""It sums up the diversity of the Republican Party and the [Republican National Committee], where they have the whole convention and they find the one black person."" Afterwards, Harris-Perry gave an on-air apology as well as apologized in a series of  Twitter tweets .      Don Imus l     In early April 2007,  Don Imus , whose radio show '' Imus in the Morning '' was simulcast on MSNBC for over ten years, described members of the  Rutgers Scarlet Knights women's basketball Rutgers University women's basketball team  as ""some nappy-headed hoes."" The comments sparked outrage, as many considered them to be racist and sexist. After sponsors began to withdraw advertisements from the show, MSNBC canceled the simulcast. Imus, as well as NBC News, apologized to the Rutgers Basketball team for the remarks. NBC News policy prohibited contributions to political campaigns unless NBC News had given its prior permission. On November 7, 2010, Olbermann posted a thank you message to supporters via Twitter. On January 21, 2011, MSNBC announced that Olbermann would host his final show that same night.      Martin Bashir     Host  Martin Bashir  resigned after making a controversial comment about Sarah Palin.      Phil Donahue        Phil Donahue 's 2002 program '' Donahue  2002 talk show  Donahue '' was canceled in late February 2003 during the buildup to the  Iraq War . Despite earlier claims of cancellation because of low ratings,  A leaked NBC internal study revealed that the studio was concerned that Donahue would act as ""a home for the liberal antiwar agenda at the same time that our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity.""

Microsoft divested its stakes in the MSNBC channel in 2005 and in msnbc.com in July 2012. The general news site was rebranded as NBCNews.com, and a new msnbc.com was created as the online home of the cable channel.In the late summer of 2015, MSNBC revamped its programming; the moves were in sharp contrast to previous programming decisions at the network. MSNBC sought to sharpen its news image by entering into a dual editorial relationship with its organizational parent NBC News. MSNBC Live, the network's flagship daytime news platform, was expanded to cover over eight hours of the day.Phil Griffin is the president and director of day-to-day operations at MSNBC.

Alexandra Villoch is the publisher, and Aminda Marqués Gonzalez a website that focuses on the truth about Florida issues, along with the '' Tampa Bay Times '', which created the Politifact concept. The ''Herald'' and the ''Times'' share resources on news stories related to Florida.    History    File Miami Herald 07 August 1945.jpg thumb left A ''Miami Herald'' headline dated August 7, 1945 featuring the  atomic bombing  of  Hiroshima, Japan       Early history     The first edition was published September 15, 1903, as ''The Miami Evening Record''. After the recession of 1907, the newspaper had severe financial difficulties. Its largest creditor was  Henry Flagler . Through a loan from Henry Flagler, Frank B. Shutts, who was also the founder of the law firm  Shutts & Bowen , acquired the paper and renamed it the ''Miami Herald'' on December 1, 1910. Although it is the longest continuously published newspaper in Miami, the earliest newspaper in the region was '' The Tropical Sun '', established in 1891. ''The Miami Metropolis'', which later became '' The Miami News '', was founded in 1896, and was the ''Herald''s oldest competitor until 1988, when it went out of business.  During the  Florida land boom of the 1920s , the ''Miami Herald'' was the largest newspaper in the world, as measured by lines of advertising.  The ''Herald'' won its first Pulitzer Prize in 1950, for its reporting on Miami's  organized crime . Its circulation was 176,000 daily and 204,000 on Sundays.  On August 19, 1960, construction began on the ''Herald'' building on  Biscayne Bay . Also on that day,  Alvah Chapman, Jr. Alvah H. Chapman , started work as James Knight's assistant. Chapman was later promoted to Knight-Ridder chairman and chief executive officer. The ''Herald'' moved into its new building at One Herald Plaza without missing an edition on March 23–24, 1963.  The paper won a landmark press freedom decision in '' Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo ''  1974 . This happened the day the '' Miami New Times '', a weekly newspaper, published salacious details of Teele's alleged affairs, including allegations that he had had sex and used  cocaine  with a  transsexual   prostitute .  The day before committing suicide, Teele had had another telephone conversation with DeFede, who recorded this call without Teele's knowledge, which was illegal under Florida law. DeFede admitted to the ''Herald''s management that he had taped the call. Although the paper used quotes from the tape in its coverage, DeFede was fired the next day for violating the paper's code of ethics, and he was likely guilty of a felony.  Many journalists and readers of the ''Herald'' disagreed with the decision to fire rather than suspend DeFede, arguing that it had been made in haste and that the punishment was disproportionate to the offense. 528 journalists, including about 200 current and former ''Herald'' staffers, called on the ''Herald'' to reinstate DeFede, but the paper's management refused to back down. The state attorney's office later declined to file charges against the columnist, holding that the potential violation was ""without a  living  victim or a complainant"". Less than a month later, responding to pressure from the Cuban community in Miami, Díaz resigned after reinstating the fired journalists. Nevertheless, he continues to claim that such payments, especially if made from organs of the state, violate the principles of  Journalism ethics and standards journalistic independence . In May 2013, the paper moved to a new building in suburban  Doral, Florida Doral .

The Wish Book program lets community members who are suffering from hardships ask for help from the paper's readers. Wishes have included asking for donations to buy medical equipment for a sick child, help with renovations to make a home  wheelchair -accessible, monetary donations to an impoverished family dealing with  cancer  treatments, and help to an elderly resident wanting to learn how to use a  computer . Readers may donate to specific causes or to the program at large.  The ''Herald'' also co-sponsors spelling bees and athletic awards in South Florida.   The ""Tropic"" section and its columnist  Dave Barry  run the  Herald Hunt , a unique annual  puzzlehunt  in the Miami area.     Miami Herald's Silver Knight Awards    The Miami Herald Silver Knight Awards is a highly regarded student awards programs. The purpose of this Awards program is to recognize outstanding individuals & leaders who have maintained good grades and have applied their knowledge and talents to contribute service to their schools and communities. The Silver Knight Awards program was instituted at The Miami Herald in 1959 by John S.

The group promotes free enterprise, socially conservative causes and candidates who advance their mission.    Positions and advocacy   Citizens United is known for its support of conservatives in politics. The group produced a  television advertisement  that reveals several legislative actions taken by  John McCain , which aired on  Fox News Channel .  Citizens United campaigned against  Michael Moore 's 2004 film '' Fahrenheit 9/11 '', advocating for government limits on how much advertising the film received.. Fearing prosecution from the FEC, the organization sought a declaratory judgment in federal court to assure their right to show the movie, leading ultimately to the Supreme Court decision in '' Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ''. It previously produced and screened advertisements attacking other  Democratic Party  USA  Democrats , including  Bill Clinton , During the campaign, Bossie made regular television appearances on behalf of the Trump campaign.

The IEA was initially dedicated to responding to physical disruptions in the supply of  Petroleum oil , as well as serving as an information source on statistics about the international  Petroleum industry oil market  and other  energy sector s.  The IEA acts as a policy adviser to its member states, but also works with non-member countries, especially  China ,  India , and  Russia . The Agency's mandate has broadened to focus on the ""3Es"" of effectual energy policy   energy security ,  economic development , and  environmental protection . The latter has focused on mitigating  climate change . The IEA has a broad role in promoting  Energy development alternate energy  sources  including renewable energy , rational energy policies, and multinational energy technology co-operation.  IEA member countries are required to maintain total oil stock levels equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year's net imports. At the end of July 2009, IEA member countries held a combined stockpile of almost 4.3 billion  Barrel  unit #Oil barrel barrels   680,000,000 m<sup>3</sup>  of oil.  On 1 September 2015,  Fatih Birol  took office as the new Executive Director, succeeding in this position former Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs,  Maria van der Hoeven .  Establishment of the new organization was proposed by  United States Secretary of State   Henry Kissinger  in his address to the  Pilgrims Society  in  London  on 12 December 1973. Also in December 1973, at the summit of the  European Communities  in  Copenhagen , Danish Prime Minister  Anker Jørgensen , who chaired the summit, declared that the summit found it ""useful to study with other oil-consuming countries within the framework of the OECD ways of dealing with the common short and long term energy problems of consumer countries.""  At the Washington Energy Conference on 11–13 February 1974, the ministers of thirteen principal oil consumer countries stated ""the need for a comprehensive action program to deal with all facets of the world energy situation by cooperative measures. In so doing they will build on the work of the OECD.""  The IEA was created on 18 November 1974 by the Agreement on an International Energy Program  IEP Agreement .  In April 2001, the IEA, in collaboration with five other international organisations   APEC ,  Eurostat , OLADE,  OPEC ,  UNSD   launched the Joint Oil Data Exercise, which in 2005 became the  Joint Organisations Data Initiative   JODI .  According to the ''World Energy Outlook 2010'', conventional crude oil production  Peak oil peaked  in 2006, with al all-time maximum of 70 millions of  oil barrels barrels  per day. International Energy Agency  IEA  Ministerial meeting was held in Paris, France on 7 and 8 November 2017. Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Morocco, Singapore and Thailand are the associate members of IEA. In 2018, Mexico joined the IEA and became its 30th member. This was a major milestone for global energy governance and another major step towards the IEA becoming a truly global energy organisation and strengthening ties with the key energy players. Since then, Indian delegations have actively participated in IEA committees, meetings and workshops. The IEA launches major publications in New Delhi to share our findings with Indian energy communities and policy-makers.  ''The Guardian'' also referred to a team of scientists from  Uppsala University  in Sweden who studied the 2008 World Energy Outlook and concluded the forecasts of the IEA were unattainable. According to their peer-reviewed report, oil production in 2030 would not exceed  while the IEA forecasts a production of . The lead author of the report, Dr. Kjell Aleklett, has claimed that IEA's reports are ""political documents"". Other research from the same group has thoroughly reviewed oil projections done by the IEA World Energy Outlook.  In the past, the IEA has been criticized by  environmental group s for underplaying the role of  renewable energy  technologies in favor of  Nuclear power nuclear   For example, in 1998, the IEA predicted global wind electricity generation would total 47.4 GW by 2020, but EWG's report states that this level was reached by the end of 2004.  Environmental groups have become critical  The IEA, arguably the most influential think tank widely used as source for policy makers around the world, is criticized for consistently underestimating the growth of solar PV in its yearly World Energy Outlook market forecasts. The solar power installed in 2016 is 4,813% more than what was predicted by IEA in 2006.  In November 2011, an IEA report entitled '' Deploying Renewables 2011 '' said ""renewable energy technology is becoming increasingly cost competitive and growth rates are in line to meet levels required of a sustainable energy future"". The report also said ""subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits"". The renewable electricity sector has ""grown rapidly in the past five years and now provides nearly 20 percent of the world's power generation"", the IEA said. </blockquote>  For the first time in 2012, an annual medium-term report which analyses the renewable energy sector will be published by the IEA. This publication on renewable energy – ""which is now the fastest growing sector of the energy mix and accounts for almost a fifth of all electricity produced worldwide – will join annual medium-term reports on oil, gas and coal, which the IEA already produces"". With this report, ""renewable energy takes its rightful seat at the table alongside the other major energy sources"".     Development and promotion of energy storage technologies     The IEA's ''Energy Conservation through Energy Storage  ECES  Programme'' has completed 20 developmental annexes covering  seasonal thermal energy storage  as sensible heat  or cold , as well as storage of thermal energy  sensible, latent, thermochemical  and electrical energy. They are held at various locations around the world. Most recent was Greenstock 2015  the 13th International Conference on Thermal Energy Storage  in Beijing, China. Enerstock 2018 will be held in Adana, Turkey.     Carbon capture     IEA promotes reduction of  Carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub>   Carbon dioxide emission emissions  for both conventional fossil-fuel  carbon capture and storage   CCS  and for bioenergy with CCS   BECCS   by working with member and partner nations on development of cost effective and efficient international and national energy policies including CCS, trading mechanisms and low-carbon technologies. The 2012 IEA report entitled ""A Policy Strategy for Carbon Capture and Storage"" argues for comprehensive policy mechanisms that include setting a market price on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as key to reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. ""In contrast to renewable energy or applications of  energy conservation energy efficiency , CCS generates no revenue, nor other market benefits, so long as there is no price on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It is both costly to install and, once in place, has increased operating costs. Effective, well-designed policy support is essential in overcoming these barriers and the subsequent deployment of CCS technology.""     Energy efficiency      At the Heiligendamm Summit in June 2007, the  G8  acknowledged an  European Union EU  proposal for an international initiative on  Efficient energy use energy efficiency  tabled in March 2007, and agreed to explore, together with the International Energy Agency, the most effective means to promote energy efficiency internationally. A year later, on 8 June 2008, the G8 countries, China, India, South Korea and the European Community decided to establish the International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation, at the Energy Ministerial meeting hosted by Japan in the frame of the 2008 G8 Presidency, in Aomori.

The newspaper then came under Goenka's sole control, taking the already anti-establishment tone of the paper to greater heights. Also at that time, it faced stiff competition from the well established '' The Hindu '' and the ''Mail'', as well as several other prominent newspapers. In the late 1930s the newspaper's circulation was no more than 2000.  In 1939 Goenka bought '' Andhra Prabha '', another prominent  Telugu language Telugu  daily newspaper. The name  Three Musketeers  was often used for the three dailies. In 1940 the whole premises was gutted by fire. '' The Hindu '', a rival newspaper, helped considerably in re-launching the paper, by getting it printed temporarily at one of its Swadesimithran's press and later offering its recently vacated premises at 2, Mount Road, which became the landmark Express Estates. This relocation also helped the Express obtain better high speed printing machines. Some claimed the Goenka had deliberately set fire to escape financial embarrassment.  In later years Goenka started the  Mumbai  edition with the landmark  Express Towers  as his office when he bought the ''Morning Standard'' in 1944. Two years later it became the Mumbai edition of ''The Indian Express''. Later, editions were started in several cities; the  Madurai  edition in 1957, the  Bangalore  edition in 1965, and the  Ahmedabad  edition in 1968. The '' The Financial Express  India  Financial Express '' was launched in 1961 at Mumbai,  Kannada Prabha    Kannada language Kannada  Daily  at  Bangalore  in 1965 and a Bangalore edition of the Telugu Daily ''Andhra Prabha'', and  Gujarati language Gujarati  dailies Lok Satta and Jansatta, from Ahmedabad and Vadodara in 1952.  The  Delhi  edition started was when the Tej group's ''Indian News Chronicle'' was acquired in 1951, which in 1953 became the Delhi edition of ''Indian Express''. In 1990 the group bought the Sterling group of magazines, along with it the ''Gentleman'' magazine.  After Ramanath Goenka's death in 1991, two of the family members split the group into Indian Express Mumbai with all the North Indian editions, while the Southern editions were grouped as Express Madurai Ltd. with  Chennai  as headquarters.  ''The Indian Express'' began publishing daily on the  World Wide Web  on 8 July 1996.

The magazine also continues to use a few spellings that are otherwise little used, such as ''focussed'', ''venders'', ''teen-ager'',     Readership    Despite its title, ''The New Yorker'' is read nationwide, with 53 percent of its circulation in the top 10 U.S. metropolitan areas.

His most famous work is probably its March 29, 1976 cover,  The March 21, 2009 cover of '' The Economist '', ""How China sees the World"", is also an homage to the original image, but depicting the viewpoint from Beijing's  Chang'an Avenue  instead of Manhattan. In September 2004, Spiegelman reprised the image on the cover of his book '' In the Shadow of No Towers '', in which he relates his experience of the Twin Towers attack and the psychological after-effects.      ""New Yorkistan""      In the December 2001 issue the magazine printed a cover by  Maira Kalman  and  Rick Meyerowitz  showing a map of New York in which various neighborhoods were labeled with humorous names reminiscent of Middle Eastern and Central Asian place names and referencing the neighborhood's real name or characteristics  e.g., ""Fuhgeddabouditstan"", ""Botoxia"" . The cover had some cultural resonance in the wake of September 11, and became a popular print and poster.  Many ''New Yorker'' readers saw the image as a lampoon of ""The Politics of Fear"", as was its title. Some of Obama's supporters as well as his presumptive Republican opponent,  John McCain Sen. John McCain , accused the magazine of publishing an incendiary cartoon whose irony could be lost on some readers. However, editor David Remnick felt the image's obvious excesses rebuffed the concern that it could be misunderstood, even by those unfamiliar with the magazine.

Reaction was mixed. Online magazine '' Slate  magazine  Slate '' criticized the cover, which shows Ernie leaning on Bert's shoulder as they watch a television with the Supreme Court justices on the screen, saying ""it's a terrible way to commemorate a major civil-rights victory for gay and lesbian couples.""

Organization   Gallup is a private, employee-owned company based in Washington, D.C. In 1938, Gallup began conducting market research for advertising companies and the film industry. and Gallup's polls were syndicated in newspapers in the U.S. and abroad. it entered partnerships to conduct polls for  USA Today  and  CNN , Following the results of the election, Gallup spent six months reviewing its methodology.  The findings from Gallup's U.S. surveys are based on the organization's standard national telephone samples, consisting of list-assisted random-digit-dial  RDD  telephone samples using a proportionate,  stratified sampling  design. A computer randomly generates the phone numbers Gallup calls from all working phone exchanges  the first three numbers of your local phone number  and not-listed phone numbers; thus, Gallup is as likely to call unlisted phone numbers as well as listed phone numbers.  Within each contacted household reached via landline, an interview is sought with an adult 18 years of age or older living in the household who will have the next birthday.  Gallup does not use the same respondent selection procedure when making calls to cell phones because they are typically associated with one individual rather than shared among several members of a household. Gallup Daily tracking includes Spanish-language interviews for Spanish-speaking respondents and interviews in Alaska and Hawaii.  When respondents to be interviewed are selected at random, every adult has an equal probability of falling into the sample. The typical sample size for a Gallup poll, either a traditional stand-alone poll or one night's interviewing from Gallup's Daily tracking, is 1,000 national adults with a margin of error of ±4 percentage points. Gallup's Daily tracking process now allows Gallup analysts to aggregate larger groups of interviews for more detailed subgroup analysis. But the accuracy of the estimates derived only marginally improves with larger sample sizes.  After Gallup collects and processes survey data, each respondent is assigned a weight so that the demographic characteristics of the total weighted sample of respondents match the latest estimates of the demographic characteristics of the adult population available from the U.S. Census Bureau. Gallup weights data to census estimates for gender, race, age, educational attainment, and region.  In 2012, Gallup's final election survey had  Mitt Romney  at 49% and  Barack Obama  at 48%, compared to the final election results showing Obama with 51.1% to Romney's 47.2%.  In 2013, the accuracy of Gallup polling on religious faith was questioned.      Gallup World Poll Methodology     Gallup interviews approximately 1,000 residents per country. The target population is the entire civilian, non-institutionalized population, aged 15 and older. Gallup asks each respondent the survey questions in his or her own language to produce statistically comparable results. Gallup uses telephone surveys in countries where telephone coverage represents at least 80% of the population. Where telephone penetration is less than 80%, Gallup uses face-to-face interviewing. CliftonStrengths, formerly called StrengthsFinder, is an online personality-assessment tool that focuses on 34 themes that make up the user's personality; Gallup uses the tool as part of its consulting.

The modern version of the paper is published in  Tabloid  newspaper format  tabloid format . Established in 1801 by  Federalist Party Federalist  and  Founding Fathers of the United States Founding Father   Alexander Hamilton , it became a respected  broadsheet  in the 19th century, under the name '''''New York Evening Post'''''.  In 1976,  Rupert Murdoch  bought the ''Post'' for US$30.5 million. '' The Hartford Courant '', believed to be the oldest continuously published newspaper, was founded in 1764 as a semi-weekly paper; it did not publish daily until 1836. '' The New Hampshire Gazette '', which has trademarked its claim of being ''The Nation's Oldest Newspaper'', was founded in 1756 as a weekly. Since the 1890s it has been published only on weekends.     19th century     File AlexanderHamilton.jpg thumb left  Alexander Hamilton  founded the ''Post'' in 1801   The ''Post'' was founded by  Alexander Hamilton  with about US$10,000 from a group of investors in the autumn of 1801 as the ''New-York Evening Post'', So well respected was the ''Evening Post'' under Bryant's editorship, it received praise from the English philosopher  John Stuart Mill , in 1864. When Schurz left the paper in 1883, Godkin became editor-in-chief. a founding member of both the  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People —publisher of the '' Ladies Home Journal ''—purchased the ''Evening Post'' in 1924  In 1939,  Dorothy Schiff  purchased the paper. Her husband, George Backer, was named editor and publisher. It later emerged that Murdoch bought the newspaper for US$30.5 million. which it last published briefly in 1989.       Style       File NYPost.jpg thumb right One of the paper's most famous headlines, from the edition of April 15, 1983   Murdoch imported the tabloid journalism style of many of his Australian and British newspapers, such as '' The Sun  United Kingdom  The Sun '', which remains the highest selling daily newspaper in the UK. This style was typified by the ''Post''s famous headlines such as ""Headless body in topless bar""  shown on the right, written by  Vincent Musetto  . In its 35th-anniversary edition, '' New York  magazine  New York '' magazine listed this as one of the greatest headlines. It also has five other ''Post'' headlines in its ""Greatest Tabloid Headlines"" list. In 1988, the ''Post'' hired  Jane Amsterdam , founding editor of '' Manhattan, inc. '', as its first female editor, and within six months the paper had toned down the sensationalist headlines. and, for two weeks, by  Abraham Hirschfeld Abe Hirschfeld , The show garnered the highest ratings of a nationally syndicated entertainment newsmagazine in a decade when it debuted in 2017.  Perhaps the most serious allegation against the ''Post'' is that it is willing to contort its news coverage to suit Murdoch's business needs, in particular that the paper has avoided reporting anything that is unflattering to the government of the People's Republic of China, where Murdoch has invested heavily in satellite television.  The  Public Enemy  band  Public Enemy  song "" A Letter to the New York Post A Letter to the ''New York Post'' "" from their album '' Apocalypse '91...The Enemy Strikes Black '' is a complaint about what they believed to be negative and inaccurate coverage blacks received from the paper.  The ''Post''s coverage of the murder of  Hasidic  landlord Menachem Stark prompted outrage from Jewish communal leaders and public figures.   On November 8, 2000, ''Post'' printed ""BUSH WINS!"" in a huge headline, a photograph that had already been run three days earlier in black and white on page 9, showing the 24-story  suicide  plunge of a New York University student, who had since been identified as 19-year-old Diana Chien, daughter of a prominent Silicon Valley businessman. Among criticisms leveled at ''Post'' The next day, ''Post'' had to print a new story, ""KERRY'S REAL CHOICE"", reporting Kerry's actual selection of Senator  John Edwards  of  North Carolina  as his running mate.   On April 21, 2006, several  Asian-American  advocacy groups protested the use of the headline ""Wok This Way"" for a ''Post'' article about Bush's meeting with the  Hu Jintao , President of the People's Republic of China.   On February 18, 2009, ''Post'' ran a cartoon by  Sean Delonas  that depicted a white police officer saying to another white police officer who has just shot a  Common chimpanzee chimpanzee  on the street  ""They'll have to find someone else to write the next  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 stimulus bill ."" The cartoon dually referred to President Obama and to the recent rampage of  Travis  chimpanzee  Travis , a former chimpanzee actor; it was criticized as being in bad taste, primarily by making a reference to the  racist  stereotype of  African-American s being portrayed as  apes .  Aspects of ''Post''s coverage of the 2013  Boston Marathon bombing  were criticized.  ''Post'' reported in several stories on the day of the attack that the death toll was 12, while most organizations reported two and then three fatalities. In addition, they reported that a  Saudi Arabia Saudi  national was being held as a suspect, but Boston Police denied this and said they had no suspects in custody. The ''Post'' cover story featured a picture of the victim dressed in his traditional Hasidic garb accompanied by the headline asking ""Who didn't want him dead?"" the paper realized its error and corrected it for the later editions and the website.     Highlights    The paper is well known for its  sports  section, which has been praised for its comprehensiveness; it begins on the back page, and among other coverage, contains columns about sports in the media by  Phil Mushnick .  ''New York Post'' is also well known for its  gossip  columnist  Cindy Adams .      Page Six     <!-- This section is linked from  Page Six ,  Page six ,  Page Six TV  and  Page 6  disambiguation   -->  The gossip section ""'''Page Six'''"" was created by  James Brady  columnist  James Brady  In April 2019, it was announced that Page Six TV was canceled and wouldn't be renewed for a third season. Production will continue with new episodes airing throughout the summer.     Sales    The daily circulation of ''Post'' decreased in the final years of the Schiff era from 700,000 in the late 1960s to approximately 418,000 by the time she sold the paper to Murdoch in 1976. Under Murdoch, ''Post'' launched a morning edition to compete directly with the rival tabloid '' New York Daily News Daily News '' in 1978—prompting the ''Daily News'' to retaliate with a PM edition called ''Daily News Tonight''. But the PM edition suffered the same problems with worsening daytime traffic that the afternoon ''Post'' experienced and the ''Daily News'' ultimately folded ''Tonight'' in 1981. By that time, circulation of the all-day ''Post'' soared to a peak of 962,000, the bulk of the increase attributed to its morning edition  It set a single-day record of 1.1 million on August 11, 1977 with the news of the arrest the night before of  David Berkowitz , the infamous ""Son of Sam"" serial killer who terrorized New York for much of that summer . But ''Post'' lost so much money that Murdoch decided to shut down ''Post''s PM edition in 1982, turning ''Post'' into a morning-only daily.  ''Post'' and the ''Daily News'' have been locked in a bitter circulation war ever since. A resurgence during the first decade of the 21st century saw ''Post'' circulation rise to 724,748 by April 2007, One commentator has suggested that ''Post'' cannot become profitable as long as the competing ''Daily News'' survives, and that Murdoch may be trying to force the ''Daily News'' to fold or sell out. It occupied the building until 1926 when a new main office for the ''Post'' was established at 75 West Street in the  New York Evening Post Building . The building remained in use by the ''Post'' until 1970, it was added to the  National Register of Historic Places  in 2000.

The KGEO transmitter proposal as well as a proposal by KSWS-TV  now NBC affiliate  KOBR   in  Roswell, New Mexico  to build a  transmission tower drew opposition from the  United States Air Force  and the  United States Department of Defense U.S. Department of Defense , which were concerned that broadcast towers standing at heights above  would create safety hazards for military and civil aircraft. KOCO's formal transfer to Oklahoma City made it the third station in the state's capital city to have been affiliated with ABC  WKY-TV served as a secondary affiliate from 1949 to 1956, while fledgling UHF outlet KTVQ maintained a full-time affiliation from its sign-on in 1953 until that station ceased operations in 1956.  One of channel 5's most popular local programs was a show aimed at younger audiences;  Ed Birchall  hosted a local  children's television series children's program  on the station for 29 years from March 1959 until shortly before his death after a brief bout with advanced-stage cancer in July 1988. Originally debuting as ''Lunch With HoHo'' and airing under various titles  including ''HoHo's Cartoon Circus'', ''Good Morning HoHo'' and ''HoHo's Showplace'' , Birchall – who donned a colored patchwork jacket and suspender pants, a small brown  top hat  and oversized tie in his portrayal of HoHo the  Clown  – starred alongside a  sock puppet  named Pokey  played by longtime KOCO  stage manager  Bill Howard , and presented various segments from educational content to light-hearted newspaper stories to  animated cartoon cartoon  shorts. A memorial service  the first of three held for Birchall  had to be moved to St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church, one of Oklahoma City's largest churches, to accommodate a live KOCO broadcast  which was also carried by KTVY, KWTV and KOKH-TV  as well as a crowd of mourners that included an  guard of honour honor guard  of professional clowns. Despite this, KOCO remains available on cable and  direct-broadcast satellite television satellite  providers within that market.

Due partly to its strong syndicated programming lineup, KOCO has grown to become one of ABC's strongest affiliates in recent years; it ranked as one of the network's highest-rated affiliates from 2009 to 2012, according to  Nielsen Media Research , sharing this distinction with two of its Hearst-owned sister stations,  WISN-TV  in  Milwaukee, Wisconsin Milwaukee  and  KMBC-TV  in  Kansas City, Missouri Kansas City ; the station had also made the claim of ranking as the highest-rated ABC affiliate overall from 2007 to 2009.

KOCO preempted ABC's half-hour soap operas  ''Loving'', '' The City  1995 TV series  The City '' and, until the station began clearing it in September 1998, '' Port Charles ''  for most of the 1990s in favor of first-run syndicated shows and, after September 1994, an expanded midday newscast in its standard network slot.  Beginning with the  News magazine#Television newsmagazine 's debut in 1980, KOCO-TV delayed '' Nightline '' to 11 00&nbsp;p.m. – a half-hour later than most ABC stations had carried it at the time – in order to air '' M A S H  TV series  M A S H '' reruns following its late newscast; in 1983, station management sought permission to delay ''Nightline'' to 12 30&nbsp;a.m. so it could air the  short-lived  syndicated late night talk show '' Thicke of the Night '' after ''M A S H'' starting that September. ABC vetoed the move and contracted then-independent station KOKH-TV to carry ''Nightline'' live-to-air; The station also preempted all but 90 minutes of the then four-hour-long lineup between 1992 and 1996, in favor of a local Saturday morning newscast  After NCAA regulations that restricted the number of college football games that could be televised live in a single season were overturned in a  NCAA v.

From 1988 to 1991 and again from 1993 to 1995, KOCO also maintained a programming agreement with the Sooners to air various team-related programs during the regular season, including the head coach's weekly analysis program ''Oklahoma Football'', which was co-hosted by then- sports director   Dean Blevins  and Sooners football coach  Gary Gibbs   Fox affiliate KOKH held the local rights to the Sooners magazing programs for the 1992 season, with KOCO carrying select Oklahoma State Cowboys programs such as analysis program ''The  Pat Jones  American football  Pat Jones  Show'' in the interim . The weeknight newscasts were reformatted in 1968 as ''The Hickox-Halburnt Report'', anchored by news director Richard Hickox and assistant news director Joe Halburnt Jr.; they were replaced by Dean Swanson in 1971. In 1974, as the format was growing in popularity in television markets throughout the nation, KOCO-TV rebranded its local newscasts under the '' Eyewitness News '' moniker  it was the second station in the Oklahoma City market to have utilized the format, following a previous run at KWTV between 1966 and 1971; the format was later reused under the ''Eyewitness News 5'' moniker from July 1998 to April 2013 . Swanson and chief meteorologist Fred Norman were joined weeknights by sports director Jerry Park, who would become the station's longest-serving on-air personality, remaining with KOCO for 25 years until his retirement in May 1999  Park was relegated to the weekend newscasts in 1988, following the arrival of Dean Blevins as sports director . However, the format changes did not reward the station's newscasts with a ratings win, as KOCO remained at a distant third place in the ratings for many years against the then-long-dominant channel 4 and the perennially second-place KWTV. During this period, KOCO aired its early evening newscast at 5 30&nbsp;p.m.  instead of the 6 00&nbsp;p.m. timeslot exclusively used by NBC, CBS and some ABC stations at the time , following the ''ABC Evening News'' at 5 00&nbsp;p.m., when the network first fed the newscast to its affiliates  including fellow Oklahoma-based ABC affiliates KTUL, KTEN and  KSWO-TV  in  Lawton, Oklahoma Lawton   at that time. The early-evening newscast was shifted to 5 00&nbsp;p.m.  – concurrently retitling it as ''Live at Five'' – on May 31, 1982  ABC had begun requiring affiliates located outside of the  Eastern Time Zone Eastern  and  Pacific Time Zone s to swap the airtimes of the successor '' ABC World News Tonight World News Tonight '' and their local early evening newscasts in order to allow the former to compete directly with  NBC Nightly News NBC  and  CBS Evening News CBS 's evening news programs ; a separate half-hour newscast at 6 00&nbsp;p.m.  originally titled ''Newsplus at 6 00''  subsequently premiered on September 20 of that year.  All three broadcasts ranked the market's most-watched news programs in those time periods during the November 2006  Nielsen ratings#Sweeps sweeps  period.   In June 1979, while on assignment at a  Public Service Company of Oklahoma   PSO   press conference , KOCO anchor/reporter Ron Stahl and photographer Bill Collard were arrested on a  trespassing  complaint after crossing a utility fence to cover a protest against the construction of a nuclear power plant in  Inola, Oklahoma Inola . Stahl  who contended that he and Collard would have been unable to return for the press conference in time had they chosen to hike more than  over rough terrain to reach a sanctioned area to view the demonstrators' arrests  and nine other reporters who were taken into custody – including Tom Newcomb and Susie Welsh of KTVY, and Vicki Monks of KWTV – were convicted and individually levied a $25 fine in January 1980. The convictions were appealed on  Freedom of the press in the United States press freedom  infringement complaints, but were upheld by the  United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma U.S. Court of Appeals for the Western District of Oklahoma . The  Supreme Court of the United States Supreme Court  declined to review the case upon consideration in January 1984, letting stand the convictions of Stahl and the other reporters. , which profiled children in need of an adoptive family. The station also collaborated with  ABC News ' '' 20/20  U.S. TV series  20/20 '' on the  Peabody Award Peabody  and Emmy Award-winning 1981 undercover investigative report "" Throwaway Kids "", which looked into abuse, neglect and preventable deaths of children, elderly and  mental illness mentally ill  persons in the care of the  Oklahoma Department of Human Services  that would lead to the resignation of OKDHS director  Lloyd E. Rader Sr. Lloyd Rader . By 1983, channel 5's newscasts had settled into a solid second place as a series of anchor changes helped propel KWTV from a distant third all the way to first place, displacing KTVY from the #1 ratings position it held for decades. In September 1983, the 5 00&nbsp;p.m. newscast adopted the ''Newscope'' format, a customizable syndicated news concept for local stations that featured local perspectives on major national and international news stories as well as consumer and entertainment news; KOCO reformatted the 5 00 show as a traditional local newscast after ''Newscope'' was discontinued nationally in September 1984.     Weather coverage    Although not as well known as its two principal competitors in this arena, KOCO-TV has made continual efforts over the years to improve its coverage of severe weather affecting Oklahoma. The station's Doppler weather radar system, branded on-air as ""KOCO 5 First Alert Dual-Pol Doppler"", utilizes data from a radar site at the station's Britton Road studios as well as live  Volumetric Imaging and Processing of Integrated Radar VIPIR  data from radars operated by regional  National Weather Service  forecast offices. KOCO also provides local weather updates for the ''Enid News and Eagle'' as well as for  NPR  member station  KGOU   106.3 FM  and Champlin Broadcasting-owned country radio station  KNAH   99.7 FM .  When Fred Norman was hired as the station's chief meteorologist in 1972, he became known among viewers for his quirky colloquialisms and lively on-air delivery, but also sought to improve channel 5's weather coverage. During the mid-to-late 1970s, the station offered ""Weather Watch"", a nightly post-sign-off feature consisting mainly of live imagery of the station's weather radar, along with any cut-ins from the station's meteorologists in the event that the National Weather Service issued severe weather alerts for the KOCO viewing area during the overnight hours.

In addition to the publication, ''AFA Journal'' articles are made available online. The journal reviews the content of prime-time television shows, categorizing them based on profanity, sex, violence, homosexuality, substance abuse, ""anti-Christian"" content, or "" political correctness "". The categorization is accompanied by short descriptions of the content of the episode under review. The review also lists the advertisers of each show and invites readers to contact the advertisers or television networks to express concern over program content.  Center for Law and Policy, the legal and political arm of the AFA, was shut down in 2007.  It specialized in First Amendment cases. The Center for Law and Policy lobbied legislative bodies, drafted legislation, and filed religious-discrimination lawsuits on behalf of individuals. In 1989 the AFA boycotted  Waldenbooks WaldenBooks  in an attempt to persuade the company to stop selling those same magazines. WaldenBooks responded with an advertisement campaign against censorship, asserting  First Amendment to the United States Constitution First Amendment  rights. WaldenBooks,  American Booksellers Association , the Council for Periodical Distributors Association, the International Periodical Distributors Association, and Duval Bibb Services launched a lawsuit against the AFA in October 1989, under the  Federal government of the United States Federal   Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act   RICO  and the  Florida Florida State  RICO Acts, which protect an organization's right to conduct business without harassment or threats.  During the summer of 1993 the AFA purchased full-page ads in '' The New York Times '', '' USA Today '', and '' Los Angeles Times '' denouncing the sexual and violent content of the upcoming  American Broadcasting Company ABC  police drama '' NYPD Blue ''. In December 2003, the company ""recalled the holiday catalog from all its stores, saying it needed the space on the counter for a new perfume"" and stated it would stop printing catalogs and start a new campaign.  In Spring 2005 the AFA launched a boycott of  Ford Motor Company Ford  for advertising in gay magazines, donating to  gay rights  organizations, and sponsoring  gay pride  celebrations. which had a director on the board of the  National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce . In October 2008, AFA announced the end of its boycott following the declaration to be ""neutral on same-sex marriage or any 'homosexual agenda' as defined by the American Family Association"" by McDonald's in a memo to franchisees.  In December 2008, the AFA issued an ""Action Alert""  In July 2012, they considered boycotting  Google  due to Google's "" Legalize Love "" campaign which supports  LGBT  rights. due to Target announcing they ""welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.""      Sexual morality     The AFA has repeatedly lobbied Congress to eliminate funding for the  National Endowment for the Arts .     View on media    Wildmon has been accused of saying that he believes Hollywood and the theater world are heavily influenced by  Jewish people , and that television network executives and advertisers have a genuine hostility towards Christians. the AFA released an ""Action Alert."" The Action Alert, entitled ""A first for America...The Koran replaces the Bible at swearing-in oath  What book will America base its values on, the Bible or the Koran?"", requested subscribers to write to their Congressional representatives and urge them to create a ""law making the Bible the book used in the swearing-in ceremony of representatives and senators."" that ""Permits should not be granted to build even one more mosque in the United States of America, let alone the monstrosity planned for Ground Zero. This is for one simple reason  each Islamic mosque is dedicated to the overthrow of the American government."" Fischer continued  ""Because of this subversive ideology, Muslims cannot claim religious freedom protections under the First Amendment.""  The AFA actively lobbies against the social acceptance of homosexual behavior  ""''We oppose the homosexual movement's efforts to convince our society that their behavior is normal''"" .  In 2000, vice president Tim Wildmon spoke out against  gay-straight alliance  clubs in schools, stating, ""We view these kinds of clubs as an advancement of the homosexual cause."" In 2012, the group started and then backed off from a failed campaign against the hiring of talk show host  Ellen DeGeneres  as a spokesperson for department store chain  JC Penney .  The organization has also criticized  GEICO  for a commercial showing  GEICO advertising campaigns#Maxwell the Pig Maxwell the Pig  in a car with a human girl, saying it suggests bestiality.     In God We Trust     File In God We Trust AFA Poster in New Philadelphia High School.jpg thumb A framed poster displaying the national motto of the United States in a  New Philadelphia High School  classroom  After the  September 11 attacks  in 2001, many public schools across the United States posted "" In God We Trust "" framed posters in their ""libraries, cafeterias and classrooms"". The American Family Association supplied several 11-by-14-inch posters to school systems and vowed to defend any legal challenges to the displaying of the posters. and stated that secular Jews often ""turn out to be the worst enemies of the country"" while the AFA's president Tim Wildmon stated ""Most of the Jews in this country, unfortunately, are far-left."" and stated that the  First Amendment to the United States Constitution  protects only the religious practice of Christianity, writing in a blog post ""The real object of the amendment was, not to countenance, much less to advance Mahometanism, or Judaism, or infidelity, by prostrating Christianity; but to exclude all rivalry among Christian sects... So the purpose of the First Amendment was most decidedly NOT to ""approve, support,  or  accept"" any ""religion"" other than Christianity.""  In a 2015 press release denouncing Fischer's views, the AFA stated ""AFA rejects the idea expressed by Bryan Fischer that ""Free exercise of religion"" only applies to Christians. Consequently, AFA rejects Bryan's assertions that Muslims should not be granted permits to build mosques in the United States."" is a co-author of '' The Pink Swastika ''  1995 , and  RenewAmerica  and later that year he repeated on American Family Talk that Hitler started the Nazi party ""in a gay bar in Munich"" In October, Bryan Fischer was taken off air during a CNN interview with Carol Costello for repeating his belief that ""Hitler recruited homosexuals around him to make up his Stormtroopers."" Fischer also reiterated his views on his radio show, and on video.  <blockquote>Supervisor Leslie Katz denounces your rhetoric against gays, lesbians and transgendered people. What happened to  Matthew Shepard  is in part due to the message being espoused by your groups that gays and lesbians are not worthy of the most basic equal rights and treatment. It is not an exaggeration to say that there is a direct correlation between these acts of discrimination, such as when gays and lesbians are called sinful and when major religious organizations say they can change if they tried, and the horrible crimes committed against gays and lesbians.</blockquote>  During the same time, the  San Francisco, California City and County of San Francisco  passed two resolutions. Resolution No. 234-99 ""calls for the Religious Right to take accountability for the impact of their long-standing rhetoric denouncing gays and lesbians, which leads to a climate of mistrust and discrimination that can open the door to horrible crimes such as those committed against  Equality Alabama#Gaither Mr. Gaither ""  In July 2000, the AFA sent out emails and letters calling for  Coming out openly gay   Arizona   Republican Party  United States  Republican   United States House of Representatives  member  Jim Kolbe  to be barred from speaking at the Republican National Convention. , the images were still on AFA's web site.&nbsp;– changed an AP profile of Olympic sprinter  Tyson Gay , rendering his name as "" Tyson Homosexual "".

''AFA Journal'' relied on testimony by two anonymous claimed teenage concertgoers. Mark Potok of the SPLC determined that the turning point was 2003's '' Lawrence v. Texas '', in which the  United States Supreme Court Supreme Court  struck down Texas's anti-sodomy laws. After that, the Christian right spent millions on advertisements, calling the list ""slanderous"". Jillian Rayfield of '' Talking Points Memo '' noted the irony in the website calling the SPLC a ""radical Left"" group ""spreading hateful rhetoric"" yet elsewhere declaring that the debates of the Christian right ""can and must remain civil&nbsp;– but they must never be suppressed through personal assaults that aim only to malign an opponent's character.""

On the channel's growth, Murdoch said at that time  ""Sky News, has quietly, if expensively, become the first building block of what we envision will become the premier worldwide electronic news-gathering network anywhere. Ask anyone in Europe, and particularly the BBC and you will be told that Sky News has added a new and better dimension to television journalism.""  Sky News was the UK's first 24-hour news channel, broadcast on  Astra 1A . It had no local competition until November 1997 when  BBC News  launched a new 24-hour channel, BBC News 24, now known simply as  BBC News  TV channel  BBC News . In September 1999 the  European Commission  ruled against a Sky News complaint which argued that the publicly funded BBC News 24 was unfair and illegal under  European Union EU  law. The EC ruled that the  television licence fee  ''should'' be considered state aid  within the meaning of Article 87  but that the BBC's public service remit justified the channel.  On 24 October 2005, Sky News moved to new studios in  Isleworth , London, and underwent a major on-screen revamp. The new studio was integrated with the newsroom and boasted the biggest video wall in Britain; it was designed by New York architects  Janson Design Group . This exercise was repeated in 2011 and 2012.  In preparation for the start of high-definition broadcasting, Sky News moved to its second studio  Studio B  on the morning of 30 March 2010. Broadcasting from Studio B continued until 9&nbsp;pm on 6 May, when it moved back to the main newsroom and launched Sky News HD in time for the  United Kingdom general election, 2010 2010 General Election  results. Sky News received a graphics refresh and a new logo to coincide with the launch of the new HD channel – this was tried out during the soft launch for Sky News HD on 22 April; Sky News' distinctive orchestral theme music, in use since 2005, was also replaced on 6 May 2010.  The new title music, composed by  David Arnold  conductor  David Arnold , was recorded with a 60-piece  Royal Philharmonic Orchestra  in  Angel Recording Studios , London and uses more than 132  audio channel s for 18 seconds of sound. The ""glass box"" studio was initially used for broadcasts from 6&nbsp;am to 6.30&nbsp;pm each weekday  with the exception of All Out Politics, which comes from Sky's Westminster studio  - as of April 2019 it is now only used from 11&nbsp;am to 7&nbsp;pm, and 9&nbsp;pm to 12&nbsp;am. The schedule was also changed.  In January 2017, Sky moved its business operations into  The News Building  London  the News Building  in central London. However,  Comcast  won the bidding war over the stake for £17.28 per-share, thus aligning Sky News with its  NBC  division of its wholly owned subsidiary  NBCUniversal . On 24 July 2013, it was added to the  Roku  streaming player.  Sky News International is available on news.sky.com to viewers around the world. On 30 September 2014, Sky News began  live stream ing the channel on  YouTube . It carries Sky News UK overnight and shares some of its presentational style. On  Foxtel  in Australia, Sky News UK is available on Sky News Active.  From 2004 to 2006,   Sky TG24  is Italy's version of Sky News, launched in 2003.     Previous Partnership with CBS News    Until 2017, Sky News had a resource-sharing agreement with  CBS News  in the United States to share footage and reporting. In July 2017, in the wake of Sky's pending takeover by  21st Century Fox   which runs the competing and ''de facto'' sister  Fox News Channel  in the U.S. , and  NBC News  acquiring a stake in  Euronews , CBS ended the agreement and entered into a similar deal with the BBC.  The first live broadcast of Sky News HD, on Sky Channel 517, was the channel's election debate which was held on 22 April 2010. For the 10 days leading up to the debate, channel 517 displayed a countdown clock to launch. The debate was hosted in HD by  Kay Burley  and  Adam Boulton . Following the end of the coverage for the evening, channel 517 moved to show a looping preview tape. The tape included the HD which were available on Sky Anytime. The loop continued until Sky News HD was launched on the evening of 6 May 2010, coinciding with the coverage of the  United Kingdom general election, 2010 2010 General Election  results, hosted by Adam Boulton.  On 26 July 2010, Sky News HD launched on the  OSN  Network, broadcasting to the Middle East and Africa.  In March 2007, BSkyB and  Chrysalis Group  announced plans to launch a dedicated Sky News Radio station on the proposed bid by  Channel 4 's  4 Digital Group  for the second  Digital audio broadcasting DAB   DAB ensemble multiplex  in the United Kingdom.  The Sky News Radio feed is available  free-to-air  on the Astra 2A satellite at 28.2 East by tuning it manually  12207.00 V, 27500, 2/3  Label  SNR .

The pop-up channel celebrated the 30th anniversary of Sky News, having first broadcast on the 5 February 1989. There were also behind-the-scenes features from elsewhere in the newsgathering operation, such as the Sky News helicopter and  Electronic News Gathering ENG  vehicles.  ''Pakistan  On Terror's Frontline'' was shown throughout the week beginning Monday 23 March 2009.    Criticism and perception    File Sky News viewing share history.png 300px thumb Sky News viewing peaked during  11 September attacks ,  Iraq War ,  2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami Asian tsunami ,  7 July 2005 London bombings  and the  death of Diana, Princess of Wales  but has generally declined to a quarter achieved in 1992–95  Sky News operates under United Kingdom broadcasting regulations which require impartial, unbiased coverage and prevent the channel from being encrypted in the UK. The channel is viewed by some in the media establishment as an impartial and unbiased provider of news.  In early 1994  Kelvin MacKenzie , former editor of '' The Sun  United Kingdom  The Sun '' newspaper, was appointed managing director of BSkyB, Sky News's parent company at the time. MacKenzie's proposed changes to Sky News led to clashes with CEO Sam Chisholm and the head of Sky News, Ian Frykberg, who protested at what they saw as an attempt to take the channel's news values downmarket. The most ferocious battle occurred when Mackenzie wanted Sky News to run an interview with  Philip Antony Fyson Buck Lady Bienvenida Buck . Frykberg refused to air the interview and resigned shortly afterwards. The interview was broadcast on  Sky One . When Sky returned to a regular schedule, viewers demanded the trial coverage be continued.   Ofcom  received 652 complaints regarding the network's neutrality after it hosted the second leaders' debate ahead of the  United Kingdom general election, 2010 2010 General Election .  Ofcom received 696 complaints relating to Sky News's then political editor  Adam Boulton 's conduct during an interview with  Alastair Campbell .  Sky News was again embroiled in controversy in October 2014, when crime correspondent  Martin Brunt  and his camera crew doorstepped Brenda Leyland, who had posted controversial comments concerning the  Disappearance of Madeleine McCann McCann investigation  on  social media . In a follow-up article, ''The Guardian'' speculated on the long-term effects on Sky News credibility.   November 2010 – the  Attorney General for England and Wales ,  Dominic Grieve   QC , was given the right to launch  contempt of court  proceedings against Sky News over the broadcaster's alleged breach of a media injunction. It was in relation to the reporting of the story of  Foreign hostages in Somalia Paul and Rachel Chandler , a Kent couple who were held captive by  Piracy off the coast of Somalia Somali pirates  for 13 months. The media was blocked from publishing details of the couple's ""health and welfare"" prior to their being freed on 14 November 2010. Sky claims that it ""scrupulously observed the terms of the injunction"", but also admitted that it ""followed the spirit, if not the letter"" of the order. At the time, lawyers representing the Chandlers obtained the court order over fears that their lives could be put in danger by the media reporting their capture. Sky News was alleged to have breached the injunction on the day of their release around from Somalia, leading the Attorney General to seek permission at the  High Court of Justice High Court  to bring contempt proceedings. and the 2002  Soham murders .  In June 2007, Sky News was named Best News Channel at the Broadcast Digital Channel Awards. It beat several other national and international broadcasters, including  Al Jazeera English  and the  BBC .

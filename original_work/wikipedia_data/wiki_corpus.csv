''star''s editor from 1899 until his death in 1948. the newspaper's early opposition and criticism of the  nazi party nazi regime </blockquote>  atkinson became the controlling  shareholder  of the ''star''. the ''star'' was frequently criticized for practising the  yellow journalism  of its era. for decades, the paper included heavy doses of crime and sensationalism, along with advocating social change. from 1910 to 1973, the ''star'' published a weekend supplement, the '' star weekly ''.  shortly before his death in 1948, joseph e. atkinson transferred ownership of the paper to a charitable organization given the mandate of continuing the paper's liberal tradition. the five trustees of the charitable organization circumvented the act by buying the paper themselves and swearing before the  supreme court of ontario  to continue what became known as the ""atkinson principles""  and the atkinson principles continue to guide the paper to this day. in february 2006, ''star'' media columnist  antonia zerbisias  wrote on her blog   <blockquote>besides, we are the ''star'' which means we all have the atkinson principles—and its multi-culti values—tattooed on our butts. fine with me. at least we are upfront about our values, and they almost always work in favour of building a better canada.  from 1922 to 1933, the ''star'' was also a radio broadcaster on its station  cfca

''toronto star'' had no advertising aside from lottery jackpot estimates from the  ontario lottery and gaming corporation   olg .  on may 28, 2007, the ''star'' unveiled a redesigned paper that features larger type, narrower pages, fewer and shorter articles, renamed sections, more prominence to local news, and less so to international news, columnists, and opinion pieces.  in 2018, the toronto star expanded its local coverge of vancouver, calgary, edmonton and halifax with rebranded daily newspapers, previously known as metro, as  starmetro  newspaper  starmetro .      editorial position    like its competitor '' the globe and mail '', the ''star'' covers ""a spectrum of opinion that is best described as urban and  central canada central canadian "" in character. the ''star'' is generally centrist and  centre-left , and is more  social liberalism socially liberal  than ''the globe and mail''. the paper has been traditionally supportive of  official bilingualism in canada official bilingualism  and maintaining canadian unity in opposition to  quebec separatism . conversely, canadian sociologist elke winter wrote in 2011 that the ''toronto star'' was less ""toronto-centric"" than its rival, ''the globe and mail'', writing that the ''star'' ""consciously reports for and from canada's most multicultural city"" and catered to a diverse readership. in the 14 federal elections between 1968 and 2015, the ''star'' endorsed the liberal party ten times, the  new democratic party  two times, and the  progressive conservative party of canada progressive conservative party  two times. but to avoid  vote-splitting  that could inadvertently help the conservatives under  stephen harper , which it saw as the worst outcome for the country, the paper also recommended canadians  tactical voting vote strategically  by voting for ""the progressive candidate best placed to win"" in certain ridings. and  john tory  in 2014.  other notable features include

voting   rcv , for single-winner elections, a national popular vote for president, a right to vote amendment to the  united states constitution constitution , and universal  voter registration . and ''monopoly politics''. the organization supports other groups that advocate alternative electoral practices, including fairvote minnesota.  the result of a merger of several smaller groups promoting proportional representation reform into a single, nationalized advocacy group, it originally had co-founder  rob richie robert richie  as executive director, co-founder matthew cossolotto as president and third co-founder  steven hill  author  steven hill  as western regional director based in seattle and later san francisco. john anderson was head of its national advisory board and in 1992

   since its founding, fairvote has expanded its reach and expressed its platforms to both the public and all levels of government through campaigns, blogs, newsletters, lobbying, interviews, amicus curiae briefs, and numerous media outlets. notable events include    1992   ted berry , the first african-american mayor of cincinnati, conducts a welcoming speech at the cpr opening convention. berry was a firm supporter of proportional representation and fought in the 1980s and 1990s to reinstate the practice in cincinnati after its repeal in 1957.  1994  robert richie appears on national radio to explain a federal judge's ruling that cumulative voting be used to settle a voting rights case in ''cane vs. worcester county, m.d.''  1997  the center releases ''monopoly politics'', a report on the undemocratic elements of the single winner plurality system.  2002  led by western regional director steven hill, san francisco becomes the first major city to pass a voter initiative, 54-46%, to adopt rcv for certain citywide elections is published, making the case for electoral system reform in the united states.  2004  san francisco becomes the first city since ann arbor, mi in 1975 to use rcv in public elections, after suing recalcitrant city officials to compel compliance with the law.   2005  arkansas institutes rcv for overseas military voters  2007  maryland becomes the first state

national popular vote bill that will award the state's electoral votes to the candidate who receives the majority of the popular vote  2016  maine becomes the first state to adopt rcv statewide.  fairvote is headquartered in  takoma park, maryland .     mission    the stated mission of fairvote is ""to make representative democracy fair, functional, and representative by developing the analysis and educational tools necessary for our reform partners to secure and sustain improvements to american elections.""  the organization's projects fall into three broad categories  fair access to participation, fair elections, and fair representation. to that end, it sponsors programs like the democracy secretary of state  sos  project, which scrutinizes practices obstructing the voting process while proposing solutions to hold electoral officials accountable for their actions. the promote our vote project focuses on local ideas to spur participation.    public perception   '''general coverage'''  fairvote has been covered by many major news outlets, including '' the washington post '', '' the new york times '', and  npr , which tend to call it a  non-partisan nonpartisan   voting rights   advocacy group . other writers claim that many fairvote policies, such as rcv, are popular in ""liberal enclaves"" under this system, voters rank candidates in order of preference, in contrast to the more widely used  plurality voting  system. this is also called ""ranked-choice voting""  rcv , though many other  ranked voting voting methods use ranked-choice ballots .  in 2002, fairvote backed a  san francisco  ballot initiative amending section 13.102 of the city charter to allow rcv in local elections.   minneapolis, minnesota   2009    portland, maine   2010    st. paul, minnesota   2011    telluride, colorado   2011  fairvote advocates the  national popular vote interstate compact , in this system, each candidate or party controls a share of seats equal to its share of the vote. the organization has proposed combining several congressional districts into one to allow for proportional representation in the  united states congress , fairvote filed a policy brief in support of the legislation, stating, ""we believe that the right to vote is a cornerstone of representative democracy that depends upon broadly defined voter eligibility, universal voter access to the polls, and election integrity."" in addition, fairvote has begun publishing data on how much time sitting presidents spend in swing states. fairvote first categorizes each seat according to its competitiveness; seats are labeled safe democratic, likely democratic, lean democratic, toss up, lean republican, likely republican, or safe republican. by aggregating congressional race data since 1982, the research attempts to highlight several elements of congressional elections&nbsp;— the ratio of competitive to noncompetitive districts, the effects of  gerrymandering , and  voter turnout &nbsp;— that fairvote believes hurt the democratic process. in the report, every congressional race is placed on a scale of competitiveness, from tight  <5% margin of victory  to no contest  >40% margin of victory , and the percentage of races within each category is tracked over time. in addition, the research tracks voter turnout and  wasted vote s over time. lastly, the report follows the success of incumbents in winning reelection over time.  finally, fairvote created representation 2020, a project that hopes to achieve parity in the numbers of men and women serving in elected office. to that end, the project has issued reports on state election preparedness, interviewed state election officials, and published voter guides that focus on  election reform  policies. the project also hopes to popularize its candidate surveys, which include questions about election planning and election integrity. notable recent cases in which they have been involved include      ''sanchez v. city of modesto''  2007      california voting rights act#sanchez v. the city of modesto ''sanchez v. city of modesto''   2007  dealt with the constitutionality of the  california voting rights act  of 2001  cvra .  fairvote argued that winner-take-all at-large voting systems caused ""vote dilutions in jurisdictions affected by racially polarized voting, even where minority voters cannot form a majority in a single member district.""  asserting that the cvra allows california to become more representative of the people, fairvote concluded that the cvra was an important and constitutional piece of government reform.  in ''united states v. village of port chester''  2008 , us district judge stephen robinson of the united states district court for the southern district of new york issued a decision that the village's election system violated the voting rights act and ordered remedial plans from all parties.  in 2007, the brennan center, representing fairvote as amicus curiae, submitted a brief supporting cumulative voting as a remedy, but also proposing another system known as ""choice voting"", a process of ranking candidates. on november 6, 2009, the court did not accept choice voting but accepted port chester's remedy of cumulative voting. on june 16, 2010, port chester elected its first latino to the board of trustees.  ''minnesota voters alliance v. city of minneapolis'' dealt with the constitutionality of rcv, which was adopted by the city of minneapolis for its municipal elections. they argued that this form of voting had legitimate policy reasons such as simplifying the election process, saving money, increasing voter turn-out, ensuring more diverse representation, and promoting civil election campaigns. and that ""minneapolis irv is constitutional because it is supported by legitimate interests, imposes no burden on the right to vote, and applies to all voters"".     ''jauregi v. city of palmdale''  2014      juan jauregui, the plaintiff, filed a complaint in april 2012 alleging that  palmdale 's at-large method of electing members to its city council resulted in vote dilution for latino and african american residents.  the city of palmdale immediately appealed the decision, reasoning that in 2001 palmdale residents voted for an at-large election system.  fairvote argued that fair representation voting, unlike at-large systems, enhanced minority groups to elect at least one candidate of their choice.  however, the city of palmdale opposed fairvote's participation, arguing that the amicus brief ""threatens significant prejudice to the city"" as it would continue to delay the certification of the city's november 2013 election. the california court of appeal has denied fairvote's application to file as amicus curiae.     references      category electoral reform in the united states   category non-profit organizations based in maryland   category organizations established in 1992   category electoral reform groups ","fairvote  formerly the center for voting and democracy  is a 501 c  3  organization that advocates electoral reform in the united states.founded in 1992 as citizens for proportional representation to support the implementation of proportional representation in american elections, the organization in 1993 became the center for voting and democracy and in 2004 changed its name to fairvote to reflect its support of such platforms as ranked choice voting  rcv , for single-winner elections, a national popular vote for president, a right to vote amendment to the constitution, and universal voter registration.fairvote releases regular publications on the state of the u.s. electoral system, including dubious democracy and monopoly politics.other projects, such as representation 2020 and ""promote our vote"", aim for increased voter participation and equitable representation of women. the organization supports other groups that advocate alternative electoral practices, including fairvote minnesota.notable members of fairvote's board of directors include nirvana bassist krist novoselic and hendrik hertzberg, a white house speechwriter for jimmy carter and longtime senior editor at the new yorker. for many years the board's chair was former congressman and 1980 independent presidential candidate john anderson.",about founding history and timeline mission public perception proposed reforms electoral procedure voting rights research and reports election research voting rights involvement in court cases <i>sanchez v. city of modesto</i>  2007  <i>united states v. village of port chester</i>  2008  <i>minnesota voters alliance v. city of minneapolis</i>  2009  <i>jauregi v. city of palmdale</i>  2014  references,0,0

""the ''morning star'' is open for genuine debate about the future of the left"", it asserted. in 1982, the ''morning star'' attacked the attitudes of '' marxism today '', the party's monthly journal, which was controlled by the eurocommunists. the paper supported the  national union of mineworkers  great britain  national union of mineworkers   num  during the  uk miners' strike  1984–1985  miners' strike of 1984–1985 , but the party had become critical of num leader  arthur scargill 's strategy towards the end of the strike.  soviet bulk orders ended abruptly in 1989  the  communist party of the soviet union  had still been buying 6,000 copies every day , and the termination of this order, with only a week's notice, was the cause of ""huge financial disruption"".     editorial policy     successive annual general meetings of the people's press printing society have agreed that the policy of the paper is founded on '' britain's road to socialism '', the programme of the  communist party of britain . the newspaper also opposed the  iraq war . on  northern ireland , the paper takes a pro- irish nationalism  line. news reports from northern ireland are described as ""by our foreign desk"".  in its masthead, the paper asserts that it supports peace and  socialism . it is  euroscepticism eurosceptic  and supported the  no2eu  platform in the  european parliament election, 2009  united kingdom  2009 european parliament election . the paper was also supportive of  brexit britain's vote  to leave the eu,  stephen doughty ,  angela c. smith angela smith ,  ian austin  politician  ian austin ,  mike gapes ,  jess phillips  politician  jess phillips , john haylett, who had been editor since 1995, took up the post of political editor. benfield had previously been deputy editor and head of production, but suffered from ill health. and the cover price does not cover print and distribution. consequently, the paper has always been dependent on donations from activists, readers, and trade unions. the paper relies on its ""star fund"" appeal  monthly target £16,000 . the circulation was thought to be around 10,000 when ben chacko took over as editor in mid-2015. and the edition of 29 july took a reduced form. a similar incident occurred on 20 october 2014 when a fire broke out near the offices and a small number of staff had to relocate to the sports editor's house in order to finish the paper. there is no sunday edition of the newspaper. there was also an expanded use of colour pictures and graphics, plus a redesign and a modern layout of the pages. the ''morning star'' also redesigned its website. in addition, a number of new and experienced journalists were engaged and the positions of full-time industrial correspondent and lobby correspondent in the house of commons were reintroduced.  in november 2011, the ''morning star'' launched an urgent appeal to raise £75,000 in order to address a number of funding issues which meant the paper might have gone under by the end of the year. in april 2012, the paper launched a daily e-edition of the full newspaper, which readers can subscribe to for a charge.  1933   jimmy shields  journalist  jimmy shields   as the ''morning star''   1966  george matthews  1974   tony chater    1995   john haylett   2009   bill benfield   2012  richard bagley  2014   ben chacko      notes    ;notes  ;citations     references            further reading     howe, mark.

thumb 200px a collection of aol cds sent to a student dormitory in germany, 2002  in its earlier incarnation as a "" closed platform walled garden "" community and service provider, aol received criticism for its community policies, terms of service, and customer service. prior to 2006, aol was known for its direct mailing of cd-roms and 3½"" floppy disks containing its software. the disks were distributed in large numbers; at one point, half of the cds manufactured worldwide had aol logos on them.  aol began drastically reducing the responsibilities and privileges of its volunteers in 2000.  the program was eventually ended on june 8, 2005.  current community leaders at the time were offered 12 months of credit on their accounts in thanks for their service.  within one decade of the class action lawsuit being filed, the class had grown to over 6,000 members, comprising the largest class action lawsuit ever filed against an internet based company.  currently it is the third largest class ever involved in any lawsuit on a federal level in the united states, affecting ultimately the employment eligibility of individuals in an online environment.  in february 2010, a settlement was approved by the courts in the class action suit. the settlement included a us$15&nbsp;million payment. this payment was then divided into thirds, the first of which was attorney and legal fees. five million was then divided among the included members of the class which consisted of more than 7,000 individual former community leaders. the final five million dollars was donated to charities hand picked by hallissey and williams, and then approved by the courts for distribution.  one such charity, the remote area medical foundation  www.ramusa.org , received payments in excess of us$1.2&nbsp;million for the provision of medical services, supplies and medication for those in need within the more rural areas of the united states and beyond.  prior to the 1999 class action lawsuit, the community leaders were informed of a change in compensation for duties performed by aol.  community leaders would be charged a reduced rate per month for their accounts, and would no longer be given unlimited access without invoice.  during this live announcement via an online meeting of all community leaders in a virtual arena, brian williams of dallas led many community leaders in a virtual ""strike"" or ""sit-in"" to protest the new charges the community leaders were now being asked to pay.  this protest or strike is noted as the first of its kind for an online environment and was nicknamed for the row of the arena it was held in  row 800.  following the protest, aol terminated the online working relationship between itself and several of the community leaders involved.  quickly following the release of these community leaders, each was reinstated, with the  exception of williams, due to his role in the protest.  during this time, williams' role on aol was that of guide xnt  guide program , cb naked  crystal ball forum , vnv naked  ivillage's vices and virtues forum  and jcommbrian  jewish community online forum .      billing disputes     aol has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. in addition, aol changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a class action lawsuit. previously, aol would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute  thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes . aol claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to

q-link , who went online in november 1985. playnet shut down shortly thereafter. the initial q-link service was similar to the original playnet, but over time q-link added many new services. when a new ibm pc client was released, the company focussed on the non-gaming services and launched it under the name america online. the original q-link was shut down on november 1, 1995, while aol grew to become the largest online service, displacing established players like compuserve and the source. by 1995, aol had about 20 million active users.aol was one of the early pioneers of the internet in the mid-1990s, and the most recognized brand on the web in the united states. it originally provided a dial-up service to millions of americans, as well as providing a web portal, e-mail, instant messaging and later a web browser following its purchase of netscape. in 2001, at the height of its popularity, it purchased the media conglomerate time warner in the largest merger in u.s. history. aol rapidly declined thereafter, partly due to the decline of dial-up and rise of broadband. aol was eventually spun off from time warner in 2009, with tim armstrong appointed the new ceo. under his leadership, the company invested in media brands and advertising technologies. on june 23, 2015, aol was acquired by verizon communications for $4.4 billion. in the following months, aol also made a

''the independent on sunday'' published its last print edition on 20 march 2016 and was closed following that. after launching in the london area and then in  north west england , a new second section, ""extra"", was introduced on 25 april 2006. it is similar to ''the guardian''s ""g2"" and ''the times''s ""times2"", containing features, reportage and games, including  sudoku . in june 2007, ''the independent on sunday'' consolidated its content into a news section which included sports and business, and a magazine focusing on life and culture. from 26 october 2010, the same day as its sister paper, ''i'', was launched, ''the independent'' was printed on slightly thicker paper than before and ceased to be full-colour throughout, with many photographs and pictures  though none of those used in adverts  being printed in black and white only. on 11 october 2011, ''the independent'' unveiled yet another new look, featuring a red, sans-serif masthead. in november 2013, the whole newspaper was overhauled again, including new custom fonts and a vertical masthead in black.     front pages    following the 2003 switch in format, ''the independent'' became known for its unorthodox and campaigning front pages, which frequently relied on images, graphics or lists rather than traditional headlines and written news content. for example, following the kashmir earthquake in 2005, it used its front page to urge its readers to donate to its appeal fund, and following the publication of the  hutton inquiry hutton report  into the death of british government scientist  david kelly  weapons expert  david kelly , its front page simply carried the word ""whitewash?""     sections    the weekday, saturday and sunday editions of ''the independent'' all included supplements and pull-out subsections   {   - valign top  width 50%  daily  monday to friday  ''the independent''   ""monday sport""  a weekly pull-out containing reports of the previous weekend's sporting events. saturday's ''the independent''   ""saturday sport""  a weekly pull-out containing reports looking ahead to the weekend's sporting events.

''the independent'' tends to take a  classical liberal , pro-market stance on economic issues.  in addition, ''the independent'' has highlighted what it refers to as ""war crimes"" being committed by pro-government forces in the  war in darfur darfur  region of sudan.  in 2007,  alan rusbridger , editor of ''the guardian'', said of ''the independent''  ""the emphasis on views, not news, means that the reporting is rather thin, and it loses impact on the front page the more you do that"".  an  ipsos mori  poll estimated that in the  united kingdom general election, 2010 2010 general election , 44% of regular readers voted liberal democrat, 32% voted labour,    personnel       editors    { width 100%  - valign top  width 50%  ''the independent''   1986   andreas whittam smith   1994   ian hargreaves   1995   charles wilson  journalist  charles wilson   1996   andrew marr   1998   rosie boycott   1998   andrew marr  and  rosie boycott   1998   simon kelner   2008   roger alton   2010   simon kelner   2011   chris blackhurst   2016  christian broughton    andy mcsmith     donald macintyre  journalist  donald macintyre     serena mackesy     tracey macleod     rhodri marsden     jan mcgirk     deborah orr     christina patterson     peter popham     simon read  journalist  simon read     steve richards     lizzie dearden     ash sarkar     alexei sayle     will self     mark steel     catherine townsend     paul vallely     brian viner     lynne walker  critic  lynne walker     andreas whittam smith     claudia winkleman    predominantly ''the independent on sunday''       janet street-porter  — editor-at-large    kate bassett  — theatre    patrick cockburn ,  john rentoul  journalist  john rentoul ,  joan smith  novelist and journalist  joan smith ,  paul vallely  and  alan watkins  — ""comment & debate""    peter cole  journalist  peter cole  — ""on the press""    rupert cornwell  — ""out of america""    hermione eyre  — reviews    jenny gilbert  — dance    christopher hirst  and lucinda rogers — ""the weasel""  weekly illustrated column 1995–2008     dom joly  — ""first up"" in the sunday review    tim minogue  and  david randall  — ""observatory""    cole moreton  — ""news analysis""  regular double-spread     anna picard  — opera and classical    simon price  — rock and pop       photographers      timothy allen     longford prize   ''the independent'' sponsors the  longford prize , in memory of  frank pakenham, 7th earl of longford lord longford .   circulation  155,661 the first edition was in may 2006. edited by bono, it drew high sales.    awards and nominations   ''the independent'' was awarded ""national newspaper of the year"" for 2003    owners      evgeny lebedev    justin byam shaw     see also      independent foreign fiction prize ''independent'' foreign fiction prize     vandalism on wikipedia#other notable acts of vandalism brett straub incident     references       external links            category the independent     category 1986 establishments in the united kingdom   category daily newspapers published in the united kingdom   category national newspapers published in the united kingdom   category newspapers published in london   category online newspapers with defunct print editions   category publications established in 1986   category republicanism in the united kingdom ","the independent is a british online newspaper. established in 1986 as a politically independent national morning newspaper published in london, it was controlled by tony o'reilly's independent news & media from 1997 until it was sold to russian oligarch alexander lebedev in 2010. the last printed edition of the independent was published on saturday 26 march 2016, leaving only its digital editions.nicknamed the indy, it began as a broadsheet, but changed to tabloid format in 2003. until september 2011, the paper described itself on the banner at the top of every newspaper as ""free from party political bias, free from proprietorial influence"". it tends to take a pro-market stance on economic issues.the daily edition was named national newspaper of the year at the 2004 british press awards.  in june 2015, it had an average daily circulation of just below 58,000, 85 per cent down from its 1990 peak, while the sunday edition had a circulation of just over 97,000.",history 1986 to 1990 1990–1999 2000–2009 2010–2016 from 2016 content format and design front pages sections online presence political views personnel editors writers and columnists photographers longford prize related publications <i>independent on sunday</i> the <i>i</i> <i>the  red  independent</i> awards and nominations owners see also references external links,0,0

inception, followed by a secondary affiliation with nbc for the next six years.    history       early years    wral-tv began broadcasting on december 15, 1956. the first program aired was the  feature film movie  '' miracle on 34th street  1947 film  miracle on 34th street ''. a. j. fletcher’s capitol broadcasting company, which first licensed wral radio  am 1240, now  wpjl   in 1938, won the tv license in an upset over the much larger durham life insurance company, then-owners of radio station  wptf . wral shared  american broadcasting company abc  with wtvd until august 1, 1962, when channel 5 took the abc affiliation full-time.  within six months of the switch, wral-tv had become one of the strongest cbs affiliates in the country. it is one of the few stations in the country to have been a primary affiliate of all of the ""big three"" networks.  in december 1989, wral was knocked off the air when a severe  ice storm  caused the collapse of the station's  transmitter tower. within hours, channel 5 cut a deal with the then-struggling fayetteville  independent station  north america  independent station  wkft-tv  channel 40, now  univision  o&o  wuvc-dt  , allowing wral to return to the air in only three hours. wkft ran the entire wral schedule during this time. the station's new, stronger tower was activated on october 25, 1990, at which point wkft reverted to broadcasting its own programming.  in the early 1990s, wral distributed its programming via c-band satellite as part of the  primetime 24  package, reaching viewers in the  caribbean  and  latin america , as well as the few rural areas of the united states and  canada  where local over-the-air broadcast signals were not available. it was replaced in the late 1990s with fellow cbs affiliate  wsee-tv  from  erie, pennsylvania erie ,  pennsylvania  primarily because of preemptions of network programming due to  atlantic coast conference acc   college basketball basketball .     return to nbc    on january 15, 2016, wral-tv announced that it would switch to nbc on february 29, 2016. concurrently, cbs announced that the existing nbc station,  media general -owned and  goldsboro, north carolina goldsboro -licensed  wncn   channel 17 , would replace wral-tv as the triangle's cbs affiliate the same day.   meredith college  professor doug spero suggested that wral's overall dominance in the triangle was so absolute that it was in a position to become one of nbc's strongest affiliates, much as it was one of cbs' strongest affiliates. the feeling was mutual; according to  nbc news  correspondent  harry smith  us journalist  harry smith , nbc officials felt like they had ""just won the lottery"" when they learned wral was rejoining nbc.    digital television       digital

carolina's  longstanding status as a college basketball hotbed and local teams  north carolina tar heels men's basketball north carolina  and  duke blue devils men's basketball duke  being fixtures in

'', for £125 million. controversy surrounded the deal since desmond also owned  softcore pornography  magazines. since payments to the npa fund the  press complaints commission , it is possible that the ''express'' and its sister papers could cease being regulated by the pcc. the chairman of the  press standards board of finance , which manages pcc funds, described express newspapers as a ""rogue publisher"".  the express group lost prominent libel cases in 2008–2009; it paid damages to people involved in the  disappearance of madeleine mccann madeleine mccann  case  see below , a member of the  muslim council of britain , footballer  marco materazzi , and sports agent  willie mckay . the losses led the media commentator  roy greenslade  to conclude that express newspapers  which also publishes the ''star'' titles  paid more in libel damages over that period than any other newspaper group. although most of the individual amounts paid were not disclosed, the total damages were recorded at £1,570,000. greenslade characterised desmond as a ""rogue proprietor"".  in early 2008, a previous cost-cutting exercise triggered the first 24-hour national press strike in the uk for 18 years. in late august 2009 came plans for a further 70 redundancies, affecting journalists across express newspapers  including the ''daily'' and ''sunday express'', the ''daily star'', and the ''daily star sunday'' .  in may 2010, desmond announced a commitment of £100&nbsp;million over five years to buy new equipment for the printing plants, beginning with the immediate purchase of four new presses, amid industry rumours that he was going to establish a printing plant at luton.  on 31 december 2010, the express, with all the media titles in desmond's  northern & shell  group, were excluded from the  press complaints commission  after withholding payment.  in september 2017, '' daily mirror '' publisher  trinity mirror  announced its interest in buying all of express newspapers from desmond. the '' financial times '' called it potentially the biggest change in the british newspaper industry for a decade. it is edited by michael booker. its circulation in february 2019 was 272,259. the press, ""egged on by police leaks, unanimously declared adams guilty,"" except for  percy hoskins , chief crime reporter for the ''express''.  the article provoked complaints, leading to a front-page apology a  fortnight  later, in 2006 and 2007, these front-page stories consistently appeared on mondays, and ended only when the paper focused instead on the  madeleine mccann  story  see below .   even on 7 july 2006, the anniversary of the  7/7 london bombings   used by most other newspapers to publish commemorations  the front page was given over to diana. this tendency was also mocked on '' have i got news for you '' when on 6 november 2006, the day other papers reported the death sentence given to  saddam hussein  on their front pages, the ''express'' led with ""spies cover up diana 'murder'"".  according to '' the independent '' ""the diana stories appear on mondays because sunday is often a quiet day."" but said coverage needed to be toned down since daily headlines were not necessarily helpful.  in a settlement at the  high court of justice , the newspapers ran a front-page apology to the mccanns on 19 march 2008, another apology on the front of the sunday editions of 23 march and a statement of apology at the high court. the newspapers also agreed to pay costs and damages, which the mccanns said they would use to fund the search for their daughter. this was followed in october by an apology and payout  forwarded to the fund again  to a group who had become known as the "" tapas seven "" in relation to the case.  appearing in april 2018 before a home affairs select committee that is investigating the treatment of minority groups in print media, ''daily express'' editor gary jones said that he would be looking to change the tone of the paper. jones said that he had found past pages of the newspaper “downright offensive,” adding that they made him feel “very uncomfortable” and contributed to an “islamophobic sentiment” in the media.  the newspaper has declared its support for the  conservative party  uk  conservative party  at every general election since  world war ii , until 2015 where they began supporting the  uk independence party . the campaign attracted the support of many celebrities including sportsman/tv personality sir  ian botham  who both gave interviews for 8 january's special edition of the paper. the first week of the campaign saw a response of around 370,000 signatures being received  just over 50% of daily readership or around 0.6% of the uk population .    see also      '' scottish daily news ''    notes

newsroom employees were laid-off, with one sports columnist,  mike downey , having departed several weeks earlier when his contract was not renewed. well-known bylines who were laid off included neil milbert, stevenson swanson, lisa anderson, phil marty, charles storch, courtney flynn and deborah horan. that number was less than the 90 newsroom jobs that crain's chicago business previously had reported were to be eliminated. among those let go were dupage county reporter  art barnum , editorial board member  pat widder  and photographer  dave pierini .  in september 2012, ''tribune'' education reporter joel hood resigned from the paper to become a real estate broker, city hall reporter kristen mack left the paper to become press secretary for cook county board president  toni preckwinkle ,  also in october 2012, the ''tribune'' announced plans to create a pay wall for its website, offering digital-only subscriptions at $14.99 per month, starting on november 1, 2012. seven-day print subscribers would continue to have unlimited online access at no additional charge. the suit had been filed in federal court on behalf of carolyn rusin, who had been a triblocal staff reporter from july 2010 until october 2011. on the graphic on june 12, the word ""bruins"" was ripped off and the comment was added, ""yeah, not right now we're not"", in a reference to the  2013 stanley cup finals , which play the  chicago blackhawks  against the  boston bruins .  on april 6, 2014, the ''tribune'' increased the newsstand price of its sunday/thanksgiving day paper by 50 percent to $2.99 for a single copy. the newsrack price increased $0.75, or 42.9%, to $2.50.  on february 18, 2016, the tribune announced the retirement of editor gerould kern and the immediate promotion of the paper's editorial page editor, r. bruce dold, to be the tribune's editor. the ''tribune'' endorsed obama once again for reelection in 2012. and in 1912 the paper endorsed  theodore roosevelt , who ran on the  progressive party  united states, 1912  progressive party  slate against republican president  william howard taft . in 2016, the tribune endorsed the  libertarian party  united states  libertarian party  candidate, former new mexico governor  gary johnson  for president, over republican  donald trump  and democrat  hillary clinton . despite the newspapers having had two years to prepare for it. on the ''tribune''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s web site  was controversial and is largely regarded as an effort in cost-cutting. a year after going private, following a $124&nbsp;million third-quarter loss, the tribune company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on december 8, 2008. the company made its filing with the u.s. bankruptcy court for the district of delaware, citing a debt of $13&nbsp;billion and assets of $7.6&nbsp;billion.  as part of its bankruptcy plan, owner sam zell intended to sell the cubs to reduce debt. this sale has become linked to the corruption charges leading to the december 9, 2008, arrest of former illinois governor  rod blagojevich . specifically, the ex-governor was accused of exploiting the paper's financial trouble in an effort to have several editors fired.  the law firm brown rudnick, representing the aurelius group of junior creditors, filed fraudulent transfer claims and fraud claims against 33,000 to 35,000 stockholders who bought tribune stock. articles from the  ''tribune'' are also available for purchase a la carte on  outlit .    see also       chicago tribune silver basketball ''chicago tribune''

""within seconds to minutes all the news on the homepage was replaced with news reports and some of the most dramatic news pictures ever seen,"" said heyl. the marketing team organised live reads on radio, which made news24 the local breaking news site on the event in south africa. ""as far as usage was concerned, news24 never looked back again,"" said heyl.       2002  restructuring     despite the fact that news24's traffic continued to climb, it was still struggling to turn a profit and in september 2002 the operation was restructured again. the editorial team was cut back to 12. heyl took over as business manager, while bryan porter became editor. news24 became central to all of media24 digital's sites and re-launched in december 2002. for the first time news24's potential to traffic users to other media 24 digital sites in the 24.com network was used. the new template included strong homepage focus areas showcasing content from other 24.com sites like health24, food24 and women24.      2003 to 2006  profit, tv and mobile     in 2003, media24 digital's advertising team began to earn commission. news24 was the company's best performing digital unit in terms of usage and revenue with remarkable y-on-y revenue growth in 2003 and 2004.  during this period news24 branced out into tv and cellphones.  the south african internet market had few ""at home"" users. dial-up internet was slow and expensive, which resulted in most people accessing the internet from work. news24's online usage would peak during office hours and significantly drop at night and over the weekends. it was decided that news24 would launch on dstv's interactive platform to strengthen its brand usage during off-peak hours.  at the same time, news24 was working on its first wap site to make content available on cellphones. according to porter, ""this heralded a new brand position for news24 – ‘anywhere, anytime’, meaning our users could access the news wherever they were, whenever they liked, on the device of their choice.""  to differentiate themselves from their competitors in a market that relied heavily on wire service content, news24 began to recruit regular columnists to cover a wide range of issues. the columnist section was launched in mid 2004, focusing on news analysis, as well as financial and sport commentary.  usage-wise, news24 became the first online site to register one million unique local users in a single month and during the course of 2004 witnessed some profitable months. in november 2004, heyl was replaced as business manager by the sunday times's elan lohmann. porter remained as editor and jannie momberg and elmarie jack as news editors. lohmann sought to monetise news24 by restructuring the advertising model, extending the product offering and focussing on a more service-orientated approach to advertisers.4 momberg became the editor of news24 in 2006.       2007  mynews24     news24 introduced a user-generated content section in 2007 to reflect the web 2.0 and the growth of social media. this section in effect replaced the letters section of the site and allowed users to have their articles, and later photos and blogs published.      2009  facelift     in may 2009 news24 underwent a facelift to update its look.  new features on the site included  inside news24, which offered users links to more in-depth  content from other 24.com channels. two new sections, opinion and multimedia, were created as well.  mynews24 experienced major changes as users could now rate content and authors, user-generated photographs featured more and the leaderboard allowed users to track the performance of their articles. by 2009 user-generated content had grown by 79%.  news24 ended the year on a high note with a record-breaking 1.5 million unique local users visiting the site in the month of november.      2010  over two million users     in april 2010, news24 became the first south african website and online news provider to reach more than two million domestic unique browsers  ubs  in a month. including international readership, the site reached over 2.8 million unique users in april.  ""given that no other news site to date has surpassed the one million ub mark, the two million south africans per month milestone is a major achievement and proves we are on the cutting-edge of local internet engagement,"" said momberg.  news24’s mobile application also experienced significant growth. traffic to the site’s wap application increased by more than 124% from february to april in 2010.      2011  exploring new markets     in april 2011, news24 launched a zulu language news site to meet the public’s demand for news in their home language. as expected, the site quickly flourished on the mobile platform, offering a new channel of accessing news for users who do not access the web through a computer.  news24 kenya was launched in october 2011, followed by news24 nigeria in june 2012 in a bid to create a presence in other african territories. as expected, the growth of the sites has been most obvious on mobile.     content        news     the main news sections on the site are south africa, world, africa, travel, technology, green and opinion. news24 also publishes special reports  sa politics, zimbabwe, aids focus and more  that offer readers in-depth coverage of the most important news events.  regular columnists feature on the site and deliver comments on events in the news. reportage on business news is done through fin24.com and on sport through sport24.co.za.   entertainment news is reported on channel24.co.za.      mynews24     inspired by the south korean citizen journalism website, ohmynews, news24 launched mynews24 in 2007. this section allows users to publish their own articles and photographs. cathryn reece, who was in charge of running mynews24, said that it took some time for it to take off, but that the number of unique users have grown from 5,000 in 2007 to 183,000 in 2010 and 480,500 in may 2014.  while users can write about whatever they want, reece said that most of the submissions they receive are “news-related opinion based articles”. the amount of user-generated content is also dependent on news events.  photographs sent in by users are “a big component” of mynews24. reece said that it seems that more people are willing to send in photographs if they witness something newsworthy than actually write an article about it. also, through advertising the fact that users can publish photographs on mynews24, many have become used to the idea of sending in images. according to momberg, mynews24 allows users to “engage with the news of the day, giving it more depth and public perspective”.       lifestyle     news24 links to softer health, lifestyle, and entertainment stories across the 24.com network through their special focus or inside news24 sections, both of which appear on the homepage.  other 24.com sites include  •	health24 •	women24 •	traveller24 •	wheels24 •	food24 •	gotravel24 •	channel24 •	parent24 •	ancestry24 •	careers24 •	property24 •	isizulu news24 •	wheels24 •	fin24 •	news24 nigeria •	news24 kenya      multimedia     multimedia has been part of news24 since 2009. the site’s multimedia coverage is offered across the site’s news sections with specific significance to locally produced south african content.  having grown to an average of 150,000 unique browsers per month, it is the biggest multimedia component of a news website in south africa.     mobile    in 2003 news24 started to develop its wap site to make content available on cellphones. mobile was identified as a key growth sector for news24.  in south africa, and other african countries, internet penetration is still low as many people only have web access at work, while others don’t have any access at all. however, south africa’s cellular penetration stood at 98% in 2009. this, coupled with the increased availability of cheaper smartphones, would suggest that more and more people are accessing the internet from their phones.  by visiting m.news24.com, users can download the mobile version of news24, which is designed for smaller cellphone screens.      applications     news24's iphone application was the first application of its kind among digital news sources in south africa. the application is available for apple, windows, blackberry, android users, as well as java-enabled phones, and includes top stories, multimedia, the latest sport and entertainment news – and so much more. the application can also be used to submit  news tips or photographs.  the news24 app is the most downloaded news application in africa .  in august 2010, news24 launched its ipad application, the first of its kind in south africa. the application takes advantage of the ipads bigger screen and is a hybrid of the current iphone application and the website.     interactive tv    news24’s interactive channel on dstv was launched in october 2003. this service allows dstv subscribers to view news24’s top stories via their tv sets. other sections include general news, sport and finance, with particular focus on south africa and africa.  the decision to launch this channel was inspired by the trend in south africa whereby internet usage drops significantly after office hours and tv usage rises at night. when stories are updated on the website, they are automatically fed to dstv, which is updated at various intervals, day and night, seven days a week.     references      news24 turns ten. arrie rossouw.

is an american magazine of commentary on politics and the arts, published since 1914, with influence on american political and cultural thinking. founded in 1914 by leaders of the  progressivism in the united states progressive movement , it attempted to find a balance between a humanitarian progressivism and an intellectual scientism, and ultimately discarded the latter.    political views   domestically, ''the new republic'' as of 2011 supported a largely  modern liberalism in the united states modern liberal  stance on fiscal and social issues, prior to 2014, while defending federal programs like medicare and the epa, it advocated some policies that, while seeking to achieve the ends of traditional social welfare programs, often used market solutions as their means, and so were often called ""business-friendly"". typical of some of the policies supported by both ''the new republic'' and the dlc during the 1990s were increased funding for the  earned income tax credit  program and reform of the federal welfare system, and  supply-side economics , especially the idea of reducing higher  marginal income tax rate s, which received heavy criticism from senior editor  jonathan chait .</blockquote>  ''the new republic'' does not focus solely on domestic policy, as it also brings analysis and commentary of various international affairs. support for  israel  was a strong theme in ''the new republic'' under  martin peretz , the former owner of ''the new republic''  ""support for israel is deep down an expression of america's best view of itself.""</blockquote>  on june 23, 2006, in response to criticism of the magazine from the blog  daily kos ,  marty peretz martin peretz  wrote the following as a summary of ''the new republic''s stances on then-recent issues  such editorials and articles exemplify the liberal political orientation of ''the new republic''.    history       early years    ''the new republic'' was founded by  herbert croly ,  walter lippmann , and  walter weyl  through the financial backing of heiress  dorothy payne whitney  and her husband,  willard straight , who maintained majority ownership. the magazine's first issue was published on november 7, 1914. the magazine's politics were  liberalism in the united states liberal  and  progressive movement progressive , and as such concerned with coping with the great changes brought about by middle-class reform efforts designed to remedy the weaknesses in america's changing economy and society. the magazine is widely considered important in changing the character of liberalism in the direction of governmental interventionism, both foreign and domestic. amongst the most important of these was the emergence of the u.s. as a  great power  on the international scene. in 1917, ''tnr'' urged america's entry into  world war i the great war  on the side of the  allies of world war i allies .  one consequence of world war i was the  russian revolution of 1917 . during the inter-war years, the magazine was generally positive in its assessment of the  soviet union  and  joseph stalin . however, the magazine changed its position after the  cold war  began in 1947, and in 1948 its leftist editor,  henry a. wallace , departed to run for president on the  progressive party  united states, 1948  progressive  ticket. after wallace, ''tnr'' moved toward positions more typical of mainstream american liberalism. throughout the 1950s, the publication was critical of both soviet foreign policy and domestic  anti-communism , particularly  mccarthyism . during the 1960s, the magazine opposed the  vietnam war , but was also often critical of the  new left .  up until the late 1960s, the magazine had a certain ""cachet as the voice of re-invigorated liberalism"", in the opinion of commentator eric alterman. he has criticized the magazine's politics from the left. that cachet, alterman wrote, ""was perhaps best illustrated when the dashing, young president kennedy had been photographed boarding air force one holding a copy"". from gilbert harrison.  a final ingredient that led to the magazine's increased stature in the 1980s was its ""back of the book"" or literary, cultural and arts pages, which were edited by  leon wieseltier . peretz discovered wieseltier, then working at harvard's society of fellows, and put him in charge of the section. wieseltier reinvented the section along the lines of '' the new york review of books '', allowing his critics, many of them academics, to write longer, critical essays instead of simple book reviews. alterman calls the selection of wieseltier ""probably [...] peretz's single most significant positive achievement"" in running the magazine. during other changes of editors, wieseltier remained as cultural editor. under him the section was ""simultaneously erudite and zestful,"" according to alterman, who added, ""amazingly, a full generation later, it still sings."" the magazine also published a very critical article by  elizabeth mccaughey  about the  presidency of bill clinton clinton administration 's  clinton health care plan of 1993 health care plan , commonly known as ""hillarycare"" due to its close association with first lady  hillary clinton . alterman described this article as ""dishonest, misinformed"", and ""the single most influential article published in the magazine during the entire clinton presidency"",   charles lane  journalist  chuck lane  held the editor's position between 1997 and 1999. during lane's tenure, the  stephen glass  reporter  stephen glass   #stephen glass scandal scandal  occurred. peretz has written that lane ultimately ""put the ship back on its course,"" for which peretz said he was ""immensely grateful."" but peretz later fired lane, who learned of his ouster when a '' washington post '' reporter called him for a comment. in the  entourage  pilot  pilot episode  of the  hbo  series '' entourage  u.s. tv series  entourage ,'' which first aired on july 18, 2004,  ari gold  entourage  ari gold  asks  eric murphy   ""do you read ''the new republic''? well, i do, and it says that you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.""     peretz sells remaining shares, then buys magazine back from canwest    until february 2007, ''the new republic'' was owned by martin peretz, new york financiers  roger hertog  and  michael steinhardt , and canadian media conglomerate  canwest .  in late february 2007, peretz sold his share of the magazine to canwest, which announced that a subsidiary,  canwest media works international , had acquired a full interest in the publication. peretz retained his position as editor-in-chief.  in march 2009, peretz and a group of investors, led by former lazard executive laurence grafstein and that also included  michael atler ,     new format    starting with the march 19, 2007 issue, the magazine implemented major changes    ''decreased frequency''  the magazine went to publishing twice a month, or 24 times a year. this replaced the old plan of publishing 44 issues a year. the magazine described its publication schedule as ""biweekly,"" with specified ""skipped publication dates."" there were ten of these in 2010.   ''new design and layout''  issues featured more visuals, new art and other ""reader friendly"" content. warnock typeface throughout were accented by woodcut-style illustrations.

'''punditfact''', a related site that was also created by the ''times'' editors, is devoted to  fact-checking  claims made by  political pundit s. and wisconsin's ""walk-o-meter"" tracking wisconsin governor  scott walker  politician  scott walker 's efforts.  in 2013, adair was named knight professor of the practice of journalism and public policy at  duke university , and stepped down as bureau chief at the ''times'' and as editor at politifact.com.  the organization was acquired in february 2018 by the  poynter institute , a non-profit journalism education and news media research center that also owns the ''tampa bay times''.  ; 2010 in december 2010, politifact.com dubbed the lie of the year to be the contention among some opponents of the patient protection and affordable care act that it represented a ""government takeover of healthcare"". politifact.com argued that this was not the case, since all health care and insurance would remain in the hands of private companies. politifact determined that, though the republican plan would make significant changes to medicare, it would not end it. politifact had originally labeled nine similar statements as ""false"" or ""pants on fire"" since april 2011.  the ""italians"" in the quote was a reference to  fiat , who had purchased a majority share of chrysler in 2011 after a  automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010 u.s. government bailout  of chrysler.  as evidence, politifact cited 4 million cancellation letters sent to american health insurance consumers. politifact also noted that in an online poll, readers overwhelmingly agreed with the selection.  ; 2015 politifact's 2015 lie of the year was the ""various statements"" made by 2016 republican presidential candidate donald trump. politifact found that 76% of trump's statements that they reviewed were rated ""mostly false,"" ""false"" or ""pants on fire"". statements that were rated ""pants on fire"" included his assertion that the mexican government sends ""the bad ones over"" the border into the united states, and his claim that he saw ""thousands and thousands"" of people cheering the collapse of the  september 11 attacks world trade center on 9/11 .  ; 2017 politifact's 2017 lie of the year was donald trump's claim that  russian interference in the 2016 united states elections russian election interference  is a ""made-up story.""     reception    politifact.com was awarded the  pulitzer prize for national reporting  in 2009 for ""its fact-checking initiative during the 2008 presidential campaign that used probing reporters and the power of the world wide web to examine more than 750 political claims, separating rhetoric from truth to enlighten voters"".  tv critic  james poniewozik  at '' time  magazine  time '' characterized politifact as having the ""hard-earned and important position as referee in the mudslinging contest—a 'truth vigilante,' as it were"", and ""politifact is trying to do the right thing here. and despite the efforts of partisans to work the refs by complaining about various calls they’ve made in the past, they’re generally doing a hard, important thing well. they often do it better than the rest of the political media, and the political press owes them for doing it."" poniewozik also suggested, ""they need to improve their rating system, to address the irresponsible, the unprovable, the dubious. otherwise, they’re doing exactly what they were founded to stop  using language to spread false impressions.""  in february 2011,  university of minnesota  political science professor eric ostermeier analyzed 511 politifact stories issued from january 2010 through january 2011. he found that the number of statements analyzed from republicans and from democrats was comparable, but republicans have been assigned substantially harsher grades, receiving 'false' or 'pants on fire' more than three times as often as democrats. ostermeier suggested that this may indicate a bias in the selection of statements to analyze, concluding  ""the question is not whether politifact will ultimately convert skeptics on the right that they do not have ulterior motives in the selection of what statements are rated, but whether the organization can give a convincing argument that either a  republicans in fact do lie much more than democrats, or b  if they do not, that it is immaterial that politifact covers political discourse with a frame that suggests this is the case.""   matt welch , in the february 2013 issue of '' reason  magazine  reason '' magazine, criticized politifact and other media fact-checkers for focusing much more on statements by politicians about their opponents, rather than statements by politicians and government officials about their own policies, thus serving as ""a check on the exercise of rhetoric"" but not ""a check on the exercise of power"".     see also       glenn kessler  journalist  the fact checker     fairness

''usa today'' shares the position of having the widest  list of newspapers in the united states by circulation circulation of any newspaper in the united states  with '' the wall street journal '' and '' the new york times ''. on june 11, 1981, gannett printed the first prototypes of the proposed publication. the  two proposed design layouts were mailed to newsmakers and prominent leaders in journalism, for review and feedback. although ''usa today'' had been profitable for just ten years as of 1997, it changed the appearance and feel of newspapers around the world.     newsroom restructuring and 2011 graphical tweaks    on august 27, 2010, ''usa today'' announced that it would undergo a reorganization of its newsroom, announcing the layoffs of 130 staffers. it also announced that the paper would shift its focus away from print and place more emphasis on its digital platforms  including usatoday.com and its related  mobile app lications  and launch of a new publication called ''usa today sports''.  on january 24, 2011, to reverse a revenue slide, the paper introduced a tweaked format that modified the appearance of its front section pages, which included a larger logo at the top of each page; coloring tweaks to section front pages; a new  sans-serif  font, called prelo, for certain headlines of main stories  replacing the gulliver typeface that had been implemented for story headers in april 2000 ; an updated ""newsline"" feature featuring larger, ""newsier"" headline entry points; and the increasing and decreasing of  masthead  publishing  mastheads  and white space to present a cleaner style. developed in conjunction with brand design firm  wolff olins , the print edition of ''usa today'' added a page covering technology stories and expanded travel coverage within the life section and increased the number of color pages included in each edition, while retaining longtime elements. on september 3, 2014, ''usa today'' announced that it would lay off roughly 70 employees in a restructuring of its newsroom and business operations. orange is used for bonus sections  section e or above , which are published occasionally such as for  business travel  trends and the  olympic games olympics ;

the lead reefer is the cover page feature ""newsline,"" which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured in all four main sections and any special sections. as a national newspaper, ''usa today'' cannot focus on the weather for any one city. therefore, the entire back page of the news section is used for weather maps for the  continental united states ,  puerto rico  and the  united states virgin islands , and temperature lists for many cities throughout the u.s. and the world  temperatures for individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are suffixed with a one- or two-letter code, such as ""t"" for  thunderstorm s, referencing the expected weather conditions ; the colorized forecast map, originally created by staff designer george rorick  who left ''usa today'' for a similar position at '' the detroit news '' in 1986 , was copied by newspapers around the world, breaking from the traditional style of using monochrome contouring or simplistic text to denote temperature ranges.  also, in most of the sections' front pages, on the lower left hand corner, are ""usa today snapshots"", which give statistics of various lifestyle interests according to the section it is in  for example, a snapshot in ""life"" could show how many people tend to watch a certain genre of television show based upon the type of mood they are in at the time . these ""snapshots"" are shown through graphs which are made up of various illustrations of objects that roughly pertain to the graphs subject matter  using the example above, the graph's bars could be made up of several tv sets, or ended by one . these are usually loosely based on research by a national institute  with the credited source mentioned in fine print in the box below the graph .  the newspaper also features an occasional magazine supplement called ''open air'', which launched on march 7, 2008 and appears several times a year. various other  advertorial s appear throughout the year, mainly on fridays.     opinion section    the opinion section prints ''usa today'' editorials, columns by guest writers and members of the editorial board of contributors, the newspaper's website calls this group ""demographically and ideologically diverse.""  the editorial board broke from this stance for the first time on september 29, 2016, when it published an op-ed piece condemning the candidacy of  republican party  united states  republican  nominee  donald trump , calling him ""unfit for the presidency"" due to his inflammatory campaign rhetoric  particularly that aimed at military veterans, immigrants, and various ethnic and religious groups ; his temperament and lack of financial transparency; his ""checkered"" business record; his use of false and hyperbolic statements; the inconsistency of his viewpoints and issues with his vision on domestic and foreign policy; and, based on comments he has made during his campaign and criticisms by both  democratic party  united states  democrats  and republicans on these views, the potential risks to national security and constitutional ethics under a trump administration, asking voters to ""resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue"". corsi, a prominent conspiracy theorist, was described by ''usa today'' as an ""author"" and ""investigative journalist"". ''the washington post'' fact-checker noted that ""almost every sentence contained a misleading statement or a falsehood."" kramer was tasked with developing a new strategy for the paper as it sought to increase revenue from its digital operations.  conservative  politics  conservative   political activism activist   peter gemma  has written more than 100 op-ed pieces for ''usa today''. the magazine – which was distributed to approximately 800 newspapers nationwide at its peak with most gannett-owned local newspapers carrying it by default within their sunday editions – focused primarily on social issues, entertainment, health, food and travel. the site – which is usually updated on a routine basis of 10 to 15 times per day between 8 00&nbsp;a.m. and 6 00&nbsp;p.m. eastern time –

letter to a number of congressmen and senators, co-signed by about 2000 veterans, calling for congress to follow president  barack obama 's lead, and move to shut down the facility that they felt had

and we tell the other side of the story.""  in 2004,  robert greenwald 's documentary film '' outfoxed  rupert murdoch's war on journalism '' argued fox news had a conservative bias and featured clips from fox news and internal memos from editorial vice president  john moody  journalist  john moody  directing fox news staff on how to report certain subjects.  surveys suggest fox news is widely perceived to be ideological. a 2009 pew survey found fox news is viewed as the most ideological channel in america, with 47 percent of those surveyed said fox news is ""mostly conservative"", 14 percent said ""mostly liberal"" and 24 percent said ""neither"". in comparison,  msnbc  had 36 percent identify it as ""mostly liberal"", 11 percent as ""mostly conservative"" and 27 percent as ""neither"".  cnn  had 37 percent describe it as ""mostly liberal"", 11 percent as ""mostly conservative"" and 33 percent as ""neither"".   a may 2017 study conducted by  harvard university 's shorenstein center on media, politics and public policy examined coverage of trump's  first 100 days of donald trump's presidency first 100 days  in office by several major mainstream media outlets including fox. the instructions came after a number of fox news hosts and guests made incendiary comments about  trump administration family separation policy the trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents .  on november 4, 2018, trump's website, donaldjtrump.com, announced in a press release that fox news host sean hannity would make a ""special guest appearance"" with trump at a midterm campaign rally the following night in cape girardeau, missouri. hosts and guests on fox news called for mueller to be fired. paul waldman of the ''washington post'' described the coverage as ""no puppet. you're the puppet"", saying it was a ""careful, coordinated, and comprehensive strategy"" to distract from mueller's investigation. on november 1, 2017, ''vox'' analyzed the transcripts of fox news, cnn and msnbc, and found fox news ""was unable to talk about the mueller investigation without bringing up hillary clinton"", ""talked significantly less about george papadopoulos — the trump campaign adviser whose plea deal with mueller provides the most explicit evidence thus far that the campaign knew of the russian government's efforts to help trump — than its competitors"", and ""repeatedly called mueller's credibility into question"". at the same time, most other national mainstream media gave wall-to-wall coverage of the convictions. fox news omitted that tapper had said the use of ""allahu akbar"" in the terrorist attack was not one of these beautiful circumstances. after fox news had deleted the tweet, sean hannity repeated the misrepresentation and called tapper ""liberal fake news cnn's fake jake tapper"" and mocked his ratings. the report cited an inaccurate assertion by gen. tony thomas, the head of the united states special operations command, that a major newspaper had disclosed the intelligence.     climate change    according to the fact-checking website  climate feedback , fox news is part of ""a network of unreliable outlets for climate news.""  in 2001, sean hannity described the  scientific opinion on climate change scientific consensus on climate change  as ""phony science from the left."" fox news ran a lead story about a private investigator's uncorroborated claims about the  murder of seth rich , a  democratic national committee dnc  staffer. other news organizations quickly revealed the investigator was a donald trump supporter and had according to ''nbc news'' ""developed a reputation for making outlandish claims, such as&nbsp;one appearance&nbsp;on fox news in 2007 in which he warned that underground networks of pink pistol-toting lesbian gangs were raping young women."" max boot of the  council on foreign relations  said while intent behind fox news, as a counterweight to the liberal media was laudable, the culmination of those efforts have been to create an alternative news source that promotes hoaxes and myths, of which the promotion of the seth rich conspiracy is an example. beck regularly described soros as a ""puppet-master"" and used common anti-semitic tropes to refer to soros and his activities. prominent fox news figures such as roger ailes, bill o'reilly and eric bolling were eventually fired after a multitude of women accused them of sexual harassment. at least four lawsuits alleged fox news co-president  bill shine  ignored, enabled or concealed roger ailes' alleged sexual harassment. ailes had the year before been fired from fox news after a number of women alleged he sexually harassed them. a bureau chief said, ""if any member had been excluded it would have been the same thing, it has nothing to do with fox or the white house or the substance of the issues"".  on october 2, 2013, fox news host  anna kooiman  cited on the air a fake story from the ''national report'' parody site, which claimed obama had offered to keep the international museum of muslim cultures open with cash from his own pocket. on april 9, 2018, federal agents from the  u.s. attorney's office for the southern district of new york u.s. attorney's office  served a search warrant on the office and residence of   michael cohen  lawyer  michael cohen , trump's personal attorney.

conservative   united states u.s.  monthly  magazine  covering news and politics, edited by  emmett tyrrell  and published by the  non-profit  american spectator foundation.    from 1967 until the late 1980s, the magazine featured the writings of authors such as  thomas sowell ,  tom wolfe ,  p.j. o'rourke ,  george f. will ,  malcolm gladwell ,  patrick j. buchanan , and  malcolm muggeridge . during the 1990s, the magazine was better known for its reports on  bill clinton  and its "" arkansas project ,"" funded by businessman  richard mellon scaife  and the  bradley foundation .  for his part, wattenberg eventually incurred the displeasure of many fellow conservatives when he belatedly admitted that he had killed a story about rumors of clinton fathering a child out of wedlock as a result of his relationship with a young  african american  woman. wattenberg actually tracked down a videotape of the woman being interviewed by an unnamed third party who asked her what wattenberg described as ""softball"" questions, but he never was able to interview her himself.  wattenberg's rationales for killing the story were that he had no proof that the story was true and that the woman's testimony was unconvincing. he said that she ""seemed like a junkie."" the story was revived in 1999 by  matt drudge .  internal strife eventually led to the departure of long-time publisher  ronald burr  after a disagreement with tyrrell led burr to call for an independent audit of the magazine's finances. the departure of burr and several prominent conservative figures from the magazine's board of directors resulted in conservative foundations pulling much of the funding the nonprofit had relied on to pay high salaries to brock and tyrrell, as well as to fund  advertising mail#direct mail marketing direct-mail campaign s needed to keep up the monthly's circulation. faced with a budget crisis, the magazine, then led by publisher  terry eastland , a former spokesman in the  ronald reagan reagan   united states department of justice justice department , laid off staffers and cut spending significantly.   the magazine also struggled to pay legal bills incurred from an investigation launched against it by the justice department for alleged witness tampering in the  whitewater  controversy  whitewater investigation .  the justice department investigation led to revelations about the "" arkansas project ,"" a campaign by businessman  richard mellon scaife  to discredit the clintons by funding investigative reporting at several conservative media outlets.    2000s   as shortfalls continued,  george gilder , a longtime supporter of the magazine, who was newly wealthy from an  internet business , purchased the magazine with the goal of turning it into a profit-making glossy with significant media buzz.  numerous staff members, demoralized by the ever-looming budget crises, were laid off or departed after  joshua gilder  and  richard vigilante  took the reins and vowed to reach a new technology- and business-savvy audience. circulation and budget losses continued and even increased in the gilder era, and at one point the entire washington-based staff, other than tyrrell and executive editor and web site editor  wladyslaw pleszczynski , were laid off as operations were moved to  massachusetts , where the rest of george gilder's businesses were based. in 2003, george gilder, who had lost most of his fortune with the bursting of the  internet stock bubble , sold the magazine for $1 back to tyrrell and the american alternative foundation, the magazine's original owner.  later, the name of the owner was changed to the american spectator foundation. the magazine then moved operations back to the washington, d.c. area. later that year, former book publisher  alfred s. regnery  became the magazine's publisher. by 2004, circulation hovered at around 50,000.    2010s   in 2013, the magazine reverted to a  tabloid  newspaper format

undermine"" the protest against  american imperialism , and writes in the first person about his experiences protesting at the  national air and space museum . pleszczynski added that the issue ""was

collection. supported primarily by gifts from private donors, the hoover war collection flourished in its early years. in 1922, the collection became known as the  hoover institution library and archives hoover war library . the hoover war library was housed in the  stanford library , separate from the general stacks. by 1926, the hoover war library was known as the largest library in the world devoted to the great war. by 1929, it contained 1.4 million items and was becoming too large to house in the stanford library. in 1938, the war library revealed building plans for  hoover tower , which was to be its permanent home independent of the stanford library system. the tower was completed in 1941, stanford university's fiftieth anniversary.  in 1960, w. glenn campbell was appointed director and substantial budget increases soon led to corresponding increases in acquisitions and related research projects. in particular, the chinese and russian collections grew considerably. despite student unrest in the 1960s, the institution continued to thrive and develop closer relations with stanford.    w. glenn campbell , 1960–89  deceased      distinguished fellows       george p.

sputnik include  max keiser  and  stacy herbert , who present the weekly economics based talk show ''double down''; this came on the heels of a late june 2017 announcement  center for european policy analysis   cepa , which argues that sputnik spreads biased information. in the opinion of cepa, sputnik invites only a select group of commenting politicians, especially those known for their pro-russian views.  alexander podrabinek , a russian journalist who works for  radio france internationale  the false story was recited by the then- republican party  united states  republican  nominee for  president of the united states president   donald trump  at one of his rallies, leading eichenwald to accuse trump of rebranding russian propaganda for his own advantage. however, this has been disputed by '' the washington post '', stating that ""it's not that trump is a  putin   wikt marionette marionette , it's that he seems to have pulled bad information off a questionable website and presented it on live television to an audience of thousands without skepticism. this is an indictment of his judgment, not of his loyalty."" according to the report, sputnik news focused on highly negative stories about nato and the eu, in particular.  on 26 may 2017, journalist  andrew feinberg  journalist  andrew feinberg , who had been sputnik's white house correspondent, announced on twitter that he would no longer be reporting for the agency, citing pressure from sputnik's russian editors to write stories and ask questions at the white house that implied that murdered democratic national committee staffer  seth rich  was killed in retaliation for leaking documents to wikileaks despite the lack of any evidence to support such a conclusion. in an interview with cnn's brian stelter, feinberg also noted that sputnik management had insisted on approving or dictating questions he would ask at white house press briefings, and wanted him to ask questions that implied that the april 2017 sarin gas attack in syria was a hoax, and that sputnik tried to prevent reporters from having bylines to avoid accountability for falsehoods in stories. in november,  alphabet inc. alphabet  chairman  eric schmidt  announced that  google  will be ""deranking"" stories from rt and sputnik in response to allegations about election meddling by president putin's government, provoking an angry response from both publications.  in may 2018, the  pbs public broadcasting system 's '' pbs newshour newshour '' website published an article by  elizabeth flock  journalist  elizabeth flock  who reported that after immersing herself for a week in sputnik news and radio reports she began ""questioning everything...what i found was a stranger picture than i anticipated, one in which i began to understand how persuasive disinformation could be."" according to the article, stanton told her that ""'they mix real with unreal, use dubious sources...but trying to pin down what he really found problematic...was like pushing a wet noodle.' what he meant is that proving disinformation can be impossibly slippery."" sputnik falsely reported on 7 december 2016 that earnest stated sanctions for russia were on the table related to syria, falsely quoting earnest as saying  ""there are a number of things that are to be considered, including some of the financial sanctions that the united states can administer in coordination with our allies. i would definitely not rule that out."" according to ''the washington post'', ""many sputnik hosts profess skepticism that russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election,"" in contradiction to the assessment of the us intelligence community.  in january 2019,  facebook  removed 289 pages and 75 accounts that the company said were used by sputnik for misinformation on facebook. ;english   sputnik news service   sputnik news service  russia   sputnik news service  russia, ukraine & the baltics   sputnik exclusives   sputnik defense

''the intercept'' has been criticized for unprofessional handling of the document, and indifference to the source's safety.  nsa whistleblower  john kiriakou  and  guantanamo bay detention camp  whistleblower joseph hickman have both accused the same reporter accused of revealing winner's identity, matthew cole, of playing a role in their exposure, which, in kiriakou's case, led to his imprisonment.     podcasts        ''intercepted''        hosting           jeremy scahill     ''intercepted'' is a weekly  podcast  hosted by  investigative journalist   jeremy scahill  and produced by  first look media .

if ''national review'' is superfluous, it is so for very different reasons  it stands athwart history, yelling stop, at a time when no other is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it.</blockquote>  as editors and contributors, buckley especially sought out intellectuals who were ex-communists or had once worked on the far left, including whittaker chambers,  willi schlamm william schlamm ,  john dos passos , frank meyer and james burnham.  <blockquote>in the united states at this time liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition. for it is the plain fact that nowadays there are no conservative or reactionary ideas in general circulation... the conservative impulse and the reactionary impulse do not... express themselves in ideas but only... in irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas.</blockquote>  william buckley jr., on the purpose of ''national review''   <blockquote>[''national review''] stands athwart history, yelling stop, at a time when no one is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it… it is out of place because, in its maturity, literate america rejected conservatism in favor of radical social experimentation…since ideas rule the world, the ideologues, having won over the intellectual class, simply walked in and started to…run just about everything. there never was an age of conformity quite like this one, or a camaraderie quite like the liberals’.  the early ''national review'' faced occasional defections from both left and right.   garry wills  broke with n.r. and became a liberal commentator. buckley’s brother-in-law,  l. brent bozell jr. , who ghostwrote ''the conscience of a conservative'' for barry goldwater, left and started the short-lived  traditionalist catholic  magazine, '' triumph  magazine  triumph '' in 1966.      defining the boundaries of conservatism      buckley and meyer promoted the idea of enlarging the boundaries of conservatism through  fusionism  politics  fusionism , whereby different schools of conservatives, including  libertarians , would work together to combat what were seen as their common opponents.  buckley's goal was to increase the respectability of the conservative movement; as  rich lowry  noted  ""mr. buckley's first great achievement was to purge the american right of its kooks. he marginalized the anti-semites, the john birchers, the  nativism  politics  nativists  and their sort."" in 1962 buckley denounced  robert w. welch jr.  and the  john birch society  as ""far removed from common sense"" and urged the  republican party  united states  republican party  to purge itself of welch's influence.  in 1985, the national review and buckley were represented by attorney  j. daniel mahoney  during the magazine's $16 million libel suit against '' the spotlight ''.  the magazine has been described as ""the bible of  conservatism in the united states american conservatism "". since trump's election to the presidency, the ''national review'' editorial board has continued to criticize him. while ''national review'' contributors such as ramesh ponnuru and jonah goldberg have remained critical of trump.  each day, the site posts new content consisting of conservative, libertarian, and neoconservative opinion articles, including some syndicated columns, and news features.  it also features two  blogs     '''the corner''' – legal and judicial news and commentary   markos moulitsas , who runs the  liberalism in the united states liberal  '' daily kos '' web-site, told reporters in august 2007 that he does not read conservative blogs, with the exception of those on n.r.o.  ""i do like the blogs at the ''national review''—i do think their writers are the best in the [conservative] blogosphere,"" he said.  in 2019, the  whittaker chambers  family had nri stop an award in chambers' name following award to people whom the family found objectionable.     finances    as with most political opinion magazines in the united states, ''national review'' carries little corporate advertising. the magazine stays afloat by donations from subscribers and black-tie fund raisers around the country. the magazine also sponsors cruises featuring ''national review'' editors and contributors as lecturers.     presidential primary endorsements    ''national review'' sometimes endorses a candidate during the primary election season. editors at ''national review'' have said,

websites utilizing paywalls,"     '''''the daily telegraph''''' is an australian daily  tabloid  newspaper format  tabloid  newspaper with a unique monthly audience of 2,841,381 readers.    history   ''the tele'', as it is also known, was founded in 1879. from 1936 to 1972, it was owned by  sir frank packer 's  acp magazines australian consolidated press . that year it was sold to news limited  now  news corp australia  .  the paper ran as a  broadsheet  until 1927, when it switched to a  tabloid  newspaper format  tabloid  format. the paper returned to a broadsheet format in 1931, but wartime paper restrictions saw it return to tabloid format in 1942.  in october 1990, it  mergers and acquisitions merged  with its afternoon sister paper '' the daily mirror  sydney  the daily mirror '' to form ''the daily telegraph-mirror'' with morning and afternoon editions. the new paper continued in this vein until january 1996 when the paper name reverted to ''the daily telegraph'', in the process, removing the last vestige of the old ''daily mirror'', although the paper continued morning and afternoon editions until january 2002, when the afternoon edition was discontinued.  the circulation of the newspaper during the june quarter 2013 was 310,724 on weekdays,  the article mistakenly attributed the alleged crimes to the wrong individual, who subsequently filed a complaint of defamation in the new south wales discrict court.  in the first instance, the court found that, despite the serious errors in the article, the publisher's defence based on a prior offer of amends should prevail.  the court awarded a sum of $150,000 to the complainant.      reporting of transgender woman accused of violent axe attack     in january 2017, the daily telegraph published an article concerning a transgender woman subsequently convicted of a violent axe attack in a sydney suburb. although her transgender status was irrelevant to the incident at the time, the daily telegraph used derogatory slurs and made repeated references to the attacker's  history of sex reassignment surgery, calling the woman a ""tranny"" who ""had chopped herself"".  the following week,  special broadcasting service sbs  published an article expressing concern about how journalists ""appear to enjoy treating transgender people as the punchline to a joke,"" singling out the daily telegraph's journalist.  the tribunal found that the daily telegraph published the article with ""apparent disregard for the injurious effect it might have on transgender people."" the tribunal also held that, ""it is evident that [the journalist] was seeking to make fun of ms amati and probably transgender people more generally,"" and that the ""attempt at humour was in poor taste and completely devoid of empathy or sensitivity.""  continuing, the tribunal also held that the article ""contributes to the perpetration and perpetuation of demeaning negative stereotypes and a lack of acceptance of transgender people within the community.""  the tribunal ultimately concluded that, whilst ""close to the line"", the article did not reach the threshold for vilification.  as of september 2018, the article has been removed from the website of the daily telegraph and replaced with a notice stating ""this article is no longer available.""  the article contained an infographic that canvassed social health concerns, such as alcohol usage, obesity, and drug dependency, for which ""young aussies have only themselves to blame"".  the infographic included ""same sex attraction"" among the condemnable health problems it canvassed.  a number of  lgbt   lgbti  australians complained that the article was prejudicial, saying that sexual orientation is neither a choice nor a medical problem, and such coverage contributes to prejudice, shame and suicide risk for young same-sex attracted people.  the daily telegraph was further sanctioned by the australian press council for failing to comply with the requirements around publication of adjudication findings.  the press council required the publisher to republish the print component of the adjudication as it was not fully compliant with its

false names. she said bicycle queensland had received information that many of the names were created by electronic “bots”. a spokesperson for change.org denied that the signatures were fake, saying that the organisation’s engineering team had double-checked the petition and confirmed they had not detected any unusual activity. signatures and other private information including email addresses can be found by search engines. change.org operates a system for signature hiding, which works only if the user has an account on change.org.     advertising policy    in 2012, the site dropped most

''the sun'' became an ardent supporter of the  falklands war . the coverage ""captured the zeitgeist"", according to  roy greenslade , assistant editor at the time  though privately an opponent of the war , but was also ""xenophobic, bloody-minded, ruthless, often reckless, black-humoured and ultimately triumphalist."" the newspaper published a photograph of a missile  actually a  ugm-27 polaris polaris missile  stock shot from the  ministry of defence  united kingdom  ministry of defence   which had a large ''sun'' logo printed on its side with the caption ""here it comes, senors..."" underneath. at mackenzie's insistence, and against the wishes of murdoch  the mogul was present because almost all the journalists were on strike ,  the  satirical  magazine '' private eye  magazine  private eye '' mocked and lampooned what they regarded as the paper's  jingoistic  coverage, most memorably with the mock-''sun'' headline ""kill an argie, win a  rover metro metro !"", to which mackenzie is said to have jokingly responded, ""why didn't we think of that?"" of the labour party by ''the sun'' and other newspapers. during the  united kingdom general election, 1983 general election of 1983  ''the sun'' ran a front page featuring an unflattering photograph of  michael foot , then aged almost 70, claiming he was unfit to be prime minister on grounds of his age, appearance and policies, alongside the headline ""do you really want this old fool to run britain?"" the story, which appeared on the day of the  chesterfield by-election, 1984 chesterfield byelection  in which benn was standing, was discredited when the psychiatrist quoted by ''the sun'' publicly denounced the article and described the false quotes attributed to him as ""absurd"", ''the sun'' having apparently fabricated the entire piece. the newspaper made frequent scathing attacks on what the paper called the "" loony left "" element within the labour party ''the sun'' strongly supported the april 1986 bombing of  libya  by the us, which was launched from british bases. several civilians were killed during the bombing. their leader was ""right ron, right maggie"".       murdoch's response      murdoch has responded to some of the arguments against the newspaper by saying that critics are ""snobs"" who want to ""impose their tastes on everyone else"", while mackenzie claims the same critics are people who, if they ever had a ""popular idea"", would have to ""go and lie down in a dark room for half an hour"". both have pointed to the huge commercial success of the ''sun'' in this period and its establishment as britain's top-selling newspaper, claiming that they are ""giving the public what they want"". this conclusion is disputed by critics.  john pilger  has said that a late-1970s edition of the ''daily mirror'', which replaced the usual celebrity and domestic political news items with an entire issue devoted to his own front-line reporting of the  cambodian genocide genocide in pol pot's cambodia , not only outsold ''the sun'' on the day it was issued but became the only edition of the ''daily mirror'' to ever sell every single copy issued throughout the country, something never achieved by ''the sun''.  in january 1986 murdoch shut down the bouverie street premises of ''the sun'' and ''news of the world'', and moved operations to the new  wapping  complex in east london, substituting the electricians' union for the print unions as his production staff's representatives and greatly reducing the number of staff employed to print the papers; a year-long  picketing  protest  picket  by sacked workers was eventually defeated  see  wapping dispute  .       ""freddie starr ate my hamster""       file freddiehamster.jpg thumb left upright ""freddie starr ate my hamster"", 13 march 1986  during this period, ''the sun'' gained a reputation for running sensationalistic stories with questionable veracity. on 13 march 1986, the newspaper published one of its best known headlines  ""freddie starr ate my hamster"".  the story alleged that british comedian  freddie starr , while staying at the home of a writer and old friend of his named vince mccaffrey and his partner lea lasalle in his 2001 autobiography ''unwrapped'', starr wrote that the incident was a complete fabrication  ""i have never eaten or even nibbled a live hamster, gerbil, guinea pig, mouse, shrew, vole or any other small mammal.""  eventually resulting in 17 libel writs in total, ''the sun'' ran a series of false stories about the pop musician  elton john  from 25 february 1987. he also recalls mackenzie headlining a january 1989 story about the first same-sex kiss on the bbc television soap opera '' eastenders '' ""eastbenders"",       aids      ''the sun'' responded to the health crisis on 8 may 1983 with the headline  ""us gay blood plague kills three in britain"".  critics stated that both ''the sun'' and lord kilbracken  cherry picking  fallacy  cherry-picked  the results from one specific study while ignoring other data reports on hiv infection and not just aids infection, which the critics viewed as unethical politicisation of a medical issue. lord kilbracken himself criticised ''the sun'' editorial and the headline of its news story; he stated that while he thought that gay people were more at risk of developing aids it was still wrong to imply that no one else could catch the disease. the  press council  uk  press council  condemned ''the sun'' for committing what it called a ""gross distortion"". ''the sun'' later published an apology, which they ran on page 28. journalist  david randall  argued in the textbook ''the universal journalist'' that ''the sun'' story was one of the worst cases of journalistic malpractice in recent history, putting its own readers in harm's way.   file the sun liverpool.jpg thumb upright poster urging the liverpool public not to purchase ''the sun''  at the end of the decade, ''the sun''s coverage of the hillsborough football stadium disaster in  sheffield  on 15 april 1989, in which 96 people died as a result of their injuries, proved to be, as the paper later admitted, the ""most terrible"" blunder in its history. despite the headline, written by  kelvin mackenzie , the story was based on allegations either by unnamed and unattributable sources, or hearsay accounts of what named individuals had said – a fact made clear to mackenzie by harry arnold, the reporter who wrote the story.        later repercussions       on 7 july 2004, in response to verbal attacks in liverpool on  wayne rooney , just before his transfer from  everton f.c. everton  to  manchester united f.c. manchester united , who had sold his life story to ''the sun'', the paper devoted a full-page editorial to an apology for the ""awful error"" of its hillsborough coverage and argued that rooney  who was only three years old at the time of hillsborough  should not be punished for its ""past sins"". in january 2005, ''the sun'' managing editor  graham dudman  admitting the hillsborough coverage was ""the worst mistake in our history"", added  ""what we did was a terrible mistake. it was a terrible, insensitive, horrible article, with a dreadful headline; but what we'd also say is  we have apologised for it, and the entire senior team here now is completely different from the team that put the paper out in 1989.""  on 12 september 2012, following the publication of the official report into the disaster using previously withheld government papers which officially  exonerated  the liverpool fans present, mackenzie issued the following statement    trevor hicks, chairman of the hillsborough family support group, rejected mr mackenzie's apology as ""too little, too late"", calling him "" lowlife , clever lowlife, but lowlife"".   liverpool fc supporters and a significant majority of the city of liverpool's residents have continued to boycott the newspaper as a result of the hillsborough tragedy. access to the club grounds and facilities for ''sun'' reporters were blocked. the  mayor of liverpool   joe anderson  politician  joe anderson  described the article as ""disgrace"" and a ""slur"" on the city.  ''the sun'' remained loyal to thatcher right up to her resignation in november 1990, a month later, on 14 october, it attacked  michael heseltine  for the mass coal  mine closure s.  despite its initial opposition to the closures, until 1997, the newspaper repeatedly called for the implementation of further thatcherite policies, such as  royal mail  privatisation, it also gradually expressed its bitter disillusionment with john major as prime minister, with leaders such as ""what fools we were to back john major"".  on 22 january 1997, ''the sun'' accused the shadow chancellor  gordon brown  of stealing the conservatives' ideas by declaring, ""if all he is offering is conservative financial restraint, why not vote for the real thing?"" john major's conservatives, it said, were ""tired, divided and rudderless"". cabinet minister  peter mandelson  was ""outed"" by  matthew parris   a former ''sun'' columnist  on bbc tv's '' newsnight '' in november 1998. misjudging public response, ''the sun'' editor david yelland demanded to know in a front-page editorial whether britain was governed by a ""gay mafia"" of a ""closed world of men with a mutual self-interest"". three days later the paper apologised in another editorial which said ''the sun'' would never again reveal a person's sexuality unless it could be defended on the grounds of ""overwhelming public interest"".  in 2003, the paper was accused of racism by the government over its criticisms of what it perceived as the ""open door"" policy on immigration. the attacks came from the prime minister's press spokesman  alastair campbell  and the home secretary  david blunkett   later a ''sun'' columnist . the paper rebutted the claim, believing that it was not racist to suggest that a ""tide"" of unchecked illegal immigrants was increasing the risk of terrorist attacks and infectious diseases. it did not help its argument by publishing a front-page story on 4 july 2003, under the headline ""swan bake"", which claimed that asylum seekers were slaughtering and eating swans. it later proved to have no basis in fact. subsequently, ''the sun'' published a follow-up headlined ""now they're after our fish!"". following a  press complaints commission  adjudication a ""clarification"" was eventually printed, on page 41.      editorial and production issues in the 2000s      file potters road shops, barnet  cropped .jpg thumb ''sun''-branded newsagent shop  when  rebekah brooks rebekah wade   now brooks  became editor in 2003, it was thought page 3 might be dropped. wade had tried to persuade  david yelland  journalist  david yelland , her immediate predecessors in the job, to scrap the feature, but a model who shared her first name was used on her first day in the post.  ''the sun'' has been openly antagonistic towards other european nations, particularly the french and germans. during the 1980s and 1990s, the nationalities were routinely described in copy and headlines as ""frogs"", ""krauts"" or ""hun"". as the paper is opposed to the eu it has referred to foreign leaders who it deemed hostile to the uk in unflattering terms. former president  jacques chirac  of france, for instance, was branded ""le worm"". an unflattering picture of german chancellor  angela merkel , taken from the rear, bore the headline ""i'm big in the bumdestag""  17 april 2006 .  although ''the sun'' was outspoken against the racism directed at  bollywood  actress  shilpa shetty  on television reality show '' celebrity big brother 5  uk  celebrity big brother '' during 2007, the paper captioned a picture on its website, from a bollywood-themed pop video by  hilary duff , ""hilary  papadum poppaduff "",  on 9 december 2010, ''the sun'' published a front-page story claiming that terrorist group  al-qaeda  had threatened a terrorist attack on  granada television  in manchester to disrupt the episode of the soap opera '' coronation street '' to be transmitted  coronation street  50th anniversary live episode live  that evening. the paper cited unnamed sources, claiming ""cops are throwing a ring of steel around tonight's live episode of ''coronation street'' over fears it has been targeted by al-qaeda."" where news international had built what is claimed to be the largest printing centre in europe with 12 presses. the site also produces '' the times '' and '' the sunday times sunday times '', '' the daily telegraph daily telegraph '' and '' the sunday telegraph sunday telegraph '', '' the wall street journal europe wall street journal europe ''  also a murdoch newspaper , the '' london evening standard '', and local papers. northern printing had earlier been switched to a new plant at knowsley on merseyside and the ''scottish sun'' to another new plant at motherwell near glasgow. the three print centres represent a £600&nbsp;million investment by ni and allowed all the titles to be produced with every page in full colour from 2008. the waltham cross plant is capable of producing one million copies an hour of a 120-page tabloid newspaper.  in early 2011, the company vacated the wapping complex, which in november 2011 was put on the market for a reputed £200&nbsp;million. in may 2012, it was reported the wapping site had been sold for £150&nbsp;million to st george, part of  berkeley group holdings .  with "" broken britain "" controversies on issues like crime, immigration and public service failures in the news, on 30 september 2009, following brown's speech at the labour party conference, ''the sun'', under the banner ""labour's lost it"", announced that it no longer supported the labour party  one attack on gordon brown backfired at around this time. after criticising him for misspelling a dead soldier's mother's name, ''the sun'' was then forced to apologise for misspelling the same name on their website. several days later the ''independent'' reported ''the sun'' failure to report its own  yougov  poll result which said that ""if people thought mr clegg's party had a significant chance of winning the election"" the  liberal democrats  uk  liberal democrats  would win 49% of the vote, and with it a landslide majority.  on 24 august 2012, ''the sun'' sparked a controversy when it published photos of  prince harry  taken in a private situation with friends while on holiday in  las vegas valley las vegas , usa. while other british newspapers had not published the photos in deference to the privacy of members of the  british royal family royal family , editorial staff of ''the sun'' claimed it was a move to test britain's perception of freedom of the press. in the photos, which were published on the internet worldwide, prince harry was naked. the internet urls ''sunonsunday.co.uk'', ''thesunonsunday.co.uk'' and ''thesunonsunday.com'' were registered on 5 july 2011 by news international newspapers limited.  a reporter working for ''the sun'' was arrested and taken to a south-west london police station on 4 november 2011. the man was the sixth person to be arrested in the uk under the news international related legal probe,  operation elveden . as part of a probe in which journalists paid police officers for information; a police officer was also arrested in the probe. the ''sun'' staffers arrested were crime editor mike sullivan, head of news chris pharo, former deputy editor fergus shanahan, and former managing editor graham dudman, who since became a columnist and media writer. all five arrested were held on suspicion of corruption. police also searched the offices of news international, the publishers of ''the sun'', as part of a continuing investigation into the ''news of the world'' scandal.  coinciding with a visit to ''the sun'' newsroom on 17 february 2012, murdoch announced via an email that the arrested journalists, who had been suspended, would return to work as nothing had been proved against them.       world cup 2014 free issue      on 12 and 13 june 2014, to tie in with the beginning of the  2014 fifa world cup 2014 world cup  football tournament, a free special issue of ''the sun'' was distributed by the  royal mail  to 22 million homes in england. royal mail employees in merseyside and surrounding areas were given special dispensation by their managers to allow them not to handle the publication ""on a case by case basis"". miliband's decision to pose with a copy of  ''the sun'' received a strong response. the front page read  ""tulisa's cocaine deal shame""; this story was written by ''the sun on sunday''s undercover reporter  mahzer mahmood , who had previously worked for the ''news of the world''. it was claimed that tulisa introduced three film producers  actually mahmood and two other ''sun'' journalists  to a drug dealer and set up a £800 deal. tulisa was cleared of supplying  drugs controlled by the uk misuse of drugs act class a drugs . after these events, ''the sun'' released a statement saying that the newspaper ""takes the judge's remarks very seriously. mahmood has been suspended pending an immediate internal investigation."" on 16 january 2015, troup and edwards were cleared by the jury of all charges against them. the jury also partially cleared o'driscoll and dudman but continued deliberating over other counts faced by them, as well as the charges against pharo and pyatt.  in a separate trial, ''sun'' reporter nick parker was cleared on 9 december 2014 of aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office but found guilty of handling a stolen mobile phone belonging to labour mp  siobhain mcdonagh .  the bbc reported that france was the first journalist to face trial and be convicted under operation elveden since the crown prosecution service  cps  had revised its guidance in april 2015 so that prosecutions would only be brought against journalists who had made payments to police officers over a period of time. as a result of the change in the cps' policy, charges against several journalists who had made payments to other types of public officials – including civil servants, health workers and prison staff – had been dropped. to mark the feature's 40th anniversary, feminist author  germaine greer  wrote an article in ''the sun'' on 18 november 2010 published under the headline  ""if i ask my odd-job man what he gets out of page 3, he tells me simply, 'it cheers me up'"". the main newspaper was reported to have followed in 2015 with the edition of 16 january supposedly the last to carry such photographs after a report in '' the times '' made such an assertion.       accusations of xenophobia      on 17 april 2015, ''the sun'' columnist  katie hopkins  called  immigration migrants  to britain ""cockroaches"" and ""feral humans"" and said they were ""spreading like the norovirus"". a joint complaint was made to the  independent press standards organisation  by the  board of deputies of british jews ,  tell mama  and faith matters. a statement by the groups said ""the printing of the phrase 'the muslim problem' – particularly with the capitalisation and italics for emphasis – in a national newspaper sets a dangerous precedent, and harks back to the use of the phrase 'the  jewish problem  in the last century, to which the nazis responded with 'the  final solution ' – the  holocaust "".  ''the sun'' officially endorsed the leave campaign in the british  united kingdom european union membership referendum, 2016 referendum to remain in or leave  the  european union  on 23 june 2016, urging its readers to vote for the united kingdom to leave the eu.       website redesign      in june 2016, a redesign of ''the sun'' website was launched.    circulation   ''the sun'' dominated the circulation figures for daily newspapers in the united kingdom since the late 1970s, at times easily outpacing its nearest rivals, the ''daily mirror'' and the ''daily mail''. for a brief period in the late 1990s and early 2000s this lead was more than a million copies per day. sustained decline began in 2004, in line with print journalism as a whole, and in the six-year period from 2012-18 it lost more than a million copies from its daily figures. ''the sun'''s long run at the top was finally broken in february 2018 when it was announced that the circulation of the free ''metro'' newspaper had overtaken it for the first time. however it remains the biggest-selling newspaper in the uk.    tony gallagher   2015–present  the ''scottish sun'' voiced its support for the snp in the  scottish parliament general election, 2011 2011 parliamentary election .  at the  2015 united kingdom general election 2015 general election , ''the scottish sun'' urged its readers to back the snp. while in england and wales, the paper saw a vote for the conservatives as a means to ""stop [the] snp running the country"", the edition north of the border said the snp would ""fight harder for scotland's interests at westminster"". the republic of ireland edition shares some content – namely glamour and showbiz – with the editions published in great britain, but has mainly irish news and editorial content, as well as sport and advertising.  it often views stories in a very different light to those being reported in the uk editions. editions of the paper in great britain described the film '' the wind that shakes the barley  film  the wind that shakes the barley ''  2006  as being ""designed to drag the reputation of our nation through the mud"" and ""the most pro-ira ever"";  there is also an irish edition of the ''sun on sunday'', the ''irish sun on sunday'', which launched in february 2012.

and matthews, however, were criticized for expressing left-leaning opinions on the channel. both were later removed from their anchor positions. the show regularly outperformed cnn's '' larry king live '', and made the channel competitive in the program's time slot for the first time in over a decade. the channel also beat cnn in total adult viewers in march, marking the seventh out of the past eight months that msnbc achieved that result. the network also beat cnn for the fourth consecutive quarter, among both primetime and total viewers, as well as becoming the only cable news network to have its key adult demographic viewership grow over the last quarter, increasing by 4 percent. during this time, msnbc also became the number-one cable news network in primetime among both african american and hispanic viewers. the new campaign embraces the network's politically progressive identity.     return to hard news and alignment with nbc news  since 2015     to help revive the struggling network, msnbc in the summer of 2015 started transitioning from left-leaning, opinionated programming to hard news programming. nearly all daytime opinionated news programs were replaced with more generic news programs.  ronan farrow ,  joy-ann reid ,  krystal ball ,  touré ,  abby huntsman ,  alex wagner ,  ed schultz , and  al sharpton  lost their shows. news programs presented by established nbc news personalities such as  telemundo  anchor  jose diaz-balart , '' meet the press '' anchor  chuck todd , sunday nbc nightly news anchor  kate snow ,  thomas roberts  television journalist  thomas roberts , and former nbc nightly news anchor  brian williams  replaced the opinion shows.  in july 2016, the network debuted ''dateline extra'', which was an abridged version of '' dateline nbc '' and another step towards aligning msnbc and nbc news. the new program was hosted by ''msnbc live'' anchor  tamron hall .  in january 2017, msnbc debuted a program in the 6 pm est hour entitled '' for the record with greta '', hosted by former fox news channel anchor  greta van susteren . in may 2017, msnbc launched a 4pm afternoon program entitled '' deadline  white house '' and hosted by former white house communications director and nbc political analyst  nicolle wallace .   for the first time, msnbc in may 2017 became the highest rated american cable news network in primetime. msnbc's increasing viewership was accompanied by declining numbers at fox news channel. msnbc's may 15–19 programming topped the programming of both cnn and fox news in total viewers and the advertiser-coveted younger demographic.    notable personalities        peter alexander  journalist  peter alexander     mariana atencio     mika brzezinski     josh barro     jeremy bash     john

msnbc's ""most recognizable face"".  in october 2010, msnbc began using the tagline ""lean forward"". some media outlets, including msnbc.com, claimed that the network was now embracing its politically progressive identity.  in november 2012, ''the new york times'' called msnbc ""the anti-fox"" and quoted former president bill clinton as saying, ""boy, it really has become our version of fox.""  others have argued that msnbc has a bias against progressive politics.  phil donahue 's show was canceled in 2003 due to his opposition to the iraq war, and donahue later commented that the

and called their coverage ""absolutely embarrassing"". msnbc's on-air slogan during the week of the 2008 presidential election, ""the power of change"", was criticized for being too similar to obama's campaign slogan of ""hope and change"".      ''rise of the new right'' documentary     in june 2010, the msnbc documentary ''rise of the new right'' aired. it featured interviews with  right-wing figure right-wing  figures, including  dick armey , the former house majority leader,  orly taitz , a leading figure in the "" birther "" movement, and  conspiracy theorist  radio host  alex jones  radio host  alex jones . the documentary also showed the  michigan militia 's  survivalism survival  training camp and hit the campaign trail with kentucky senatorial candidate  rand paul . on the other hand, their coverage of barack obama improved in the final week before the presidential election. from october 1 to 28, 33 percent of stories were positive and 13 percent negative. during the campaign's final week, 51 percent of msnbc's stories were positive while there were no negative stories at all about obama in the sample.     romney family grandchild     political commentator  melissa harris-perry  and her guest panel, in a look back on the 2013 segment of  melissa harris-perry  tv program  her show , featured a picture of former republican presidential candidate  mitt romney  and his extended family. romney was holding on his knee his adopted grandchild, kieran romney, an african-american. harris-perry and her guests, including actress pia glenn and comedian  dean obeidallah , joked about coming up with captions for the photo. glenn sang out, ""one of these things is not like the others, one of these things just isn’t the same."" obeidallah said, ""it sums up the diversity of the republican party and the [republican national committee], where they have the whole convention and they find the one black person."" afterwards, harris-perry gave an on-air apology as well as apologized in a series of  twitter tweets .      don imus l     in early april 2007,  don imus , whose radio show '' imus in the morning '' was simulcast on msnbc for over ten years, described members of the  rutgers scarlet knights women's basketball rutgers university women's basketball team  as ""some nappy-headed hoes."" the comments sparked outrage, as many considered them to be racist and sexist. after sponsors began to withdraw advertisements from the show, msnbc canceled the simulcast. imus, as well as nbc news, apologized to the rutgers basketball team for the remarks. nbc news policy prohibited contributions to political campaigns unless nbc news had given its prior permission. on november 7, 2010, olbermann posted a thank you message to supporters via twitter. on january 21, 2011, msnbc announced that olbermann would host his final show that same night.      martin bashir     host  martin bashir  resigned after making a controversial comment about sarah palin.      phil donahue        phil donahue 's 2002 program '' donahue  2002 talk show  donahue '' was canceled in late february 2003 during the buildup to the  iraq war . despite earlier claims of cancellation because of low ratings,  a leaked nbc internal study revealed that the studio was concerned that donahue would act as ""a home for the liberal antiwar agenda at the same time that our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity.""     references       sources         external links                        category msnbc     category 24-hour television news channels in the united states   category american news websites   category companies based in new york city   category english-language television stations in the united states   category liberalism in the united states   category nbcuniversal networks   category progressivism in the united states   category television channels and stations established in 1996 ","msnbc is an american pay television network that provides news coverage and political commentary from nbc news on current events. msnbc is owned by the nbcuniversal news group, a unit of the nbcuniversal television group division of nbcuniversal  all of which are ultimately owned by comcast . msnbc and its website were founded in 1996 under a partnership between microsoft and general electric's nbc unit, hence the network's naming. although they had the same name, msnbc.com and msnbc maintained separate corporate structures and news operations. msnbc.com was headquartered on the microsoft campus in redmond, washington while msnbc operated out of nbc's headquarters in new york city. microsoft divested its stakes in the msnbc channel in 2005 and in msnbc.com in july 2012. the general news site was rebranded as nbcnews.com, and a new msnbc.com was created as the online home of the cable channel.in the late summer of 2015, msnbc revamped its programming;

''the miami metropolis'', which later became '' the miami news '', was founded in 1896, and was the ''herald''s oldest competitor until 1988, when it went out of business.  during the  florida land boom of the 1920s , the ''miami herald'' was the largest newspaper in the world, as measured by lines of advertising.  the ''herald'' won its first pulitzer prize in 1950, for its reporting on miami's  organized crime . its circulation was 176,000 daily and 204,000 on sundays.  on august 19, 1960, construction began on the ''herald'' building on  biscayne bay . also on that day,  alvah chapman, jr. alvah h. chapman , started work as james knight's assistant. chapman was later promoted to knight-ridder chairman and chief executive officer. the ''herald'' moved into its new building at one herald plaza without missing an edition on march 23–24, 1963.  the paper won a landmark press freedom decision in '' miami herald publishing co. v. tornillo ''  1974 . this happened the day the '' miami new times '', a weekly newspaper, published salacious details of teele's alleged affairs, including allegations that he had had sex and used  cocaine  with a  transsexual   prostitute .  the day before committing suicide, teele had had another telephone conversation with defede, who recorded this call without teele's knowledge, which was illegal under florida law. defede admitted to the ''herald''s management that he had taped the call. although the paper used quotes from the tape in its coverage, defede was fired the next day for violating the paper's code of ethics, and he was likely guilty of a felony.  many journalists and readers of the ''herald'' disagreed with the decision to fire rather than suspend defede, arguing that it had been made in haste and that the punishment was disproportionate to the offense. 528 journalists, including about 200 current and former ''herald'' staffers, called on the ''herald'' to reinstate defede, but the paper's management refused to back down. the state attorney's office later declined to file charges against the columnist, holding that the potential violation was ""without a  living  victim or a complainant"". less than a month later, responding to pressure from the cuban community in miami, díaz resigned after reinstating the fired journalists. nevertheless, he continues to claim that such payments, especially if made from organs of the state, violate the principles of  journalism ethics and standards journalistic independence . in may 2013, the paper moved to a new building in suburban  doral, florida doral .    gallery   <gallery> file the miami herald -

''post'' reported in several stories on the day of the attack that the death toll was 12, while most organizations reported two and then three fatalities. in addition, they reported that a  saudi arabia saudi  national was being held as a suspect, but boston police denied this and said they had no suspects in custody. the ''post'' cover story featured a picture of the victim dressed in his traditional hasidic garb accompanied by the headline asking ""who didn't want him dead?"" the paper realized its error and corrected it for the later editions and the website.     highlights    the paper is well known for its  sports  section, which has been praised for its comprehensiveness; it begins on the back page, and among other coverage, contains columns about sports in the media by  phil mushnick .  ''new york post'' is also well known for its  gossip  columnist  cindy adams .      page six     <!-- this section is linked from  page six ,  page six ,  page six tv  and  page 6  disambiguation   -->  the gossip section ""'''page six'''"" was created by  james brady  columnist  james brady  in april 2019, it was announced that page six tv was canceled and wouldn't be renewed for a third season. production will continue with new episodes airing throughout the summer.     sales    the daily circulation of ''post'' decreased in the final years of the schiff era from 700,000 in the late 1960s to approximately 418,000 by the time she sold the paper to murdoch in 1976. under murdoch, ''post'' launched a morning edition to compete directly with the rival tabloid '' new york daily news daily news '' in 1978—prompting the ''daily news'' to retaliate with a pm edition called ''daily news tonight''. but the pm edition suffered the same problems with worsening daytime traffic that the afternoon ''post'' experienced and the ''daily news'' ultimately folded ''tonight'' in 1981. by that time, circulation of the all-day ''post'' soared to a peak of 962,000, the bulk of the increase attributed to its morning edition  it set a single-day record of 1.1 million on august 11, 1977 with the news of the arrest the night before of  david berkowitz , the infamous ""son of sam"" serial killer who terrorized new york for much of that summer . but ''post'' lost so much money that murdoch decided to shut down ''post''s pm edition in 1982, turning ''post'' into a morning-only daily.  ''post'' and the ''daily news'' have been locked in a bitter circulation war ever since. a resurgence during the first decade of the 21st century saw ''post'' circulation rise to 724,748 by april 2007, one commentator has suggested that ''post'' cannot become profitable as long as the competing ''daily news'' survives, and that murdoch may be trying to force the ''daily news'' to fold or sell out. it occupied the building until 1926 when a new main office for the ''post'' was established at 75 west street in the  new york evening post building . the building remained in use by the ''post'' until 1970, it was added to the  national register of historic places  in 2000.

<blockquote>supervisor leslie katz denounces your rhetoric against gays, lesbians and transgendered people. what happened to  matthew shepard  is in part due to the message being espoused by your groups that gays and lesbians are not worthy of the most basic equal rights and treatment. it is not an exaggeration to say that there is a direct correlation between these acts of discrimination, such as when gays and lesbians are called sinful and when major religious organizations say they can change if they tried, and the horrible crimes committed against gays and lesbians.</blockquote>

attorney general for england and wales ,  dominic grieve   qc , was given the right to launch  contempt of court  proceedings against sky news over the broadcaster's alleged breach of a media

the terms of the injunction"", but also admitted that it ""followed the spirit, if not the letter"" of the order. at the time, lawyers representing the chandlers obtained the court order over fears that their lives could be put in danger by the media reporting their capture. sky news was alleged to have breached the injunction on the day of their release around from somalia, leading the attorney general to seek permission at the  high court of justice high court  to bring contempt proceedings. and the 2002  soham murders .  in june 2007, sky news was named best news channel at the broadcast

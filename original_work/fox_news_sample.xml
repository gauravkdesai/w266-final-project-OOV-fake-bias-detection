'''Fox News''' (officially '''Fox News Channel''' and abbreviated '''FNC''') is an American [[pay television]] [[List of news television channels|news channel]]. It is owned by the Fox News Group, which itself was owned by [[News Corporation]] from 1996&amp;ndash;2013, [[21st Century Fox]] from 2013&amp;ndash;2019, and [[Fox Corporation]] since 2019. The channel broadcasts primarily from studios at [[1211 Avenue of the Americas]] in [[New York City]]. Fox News is provided in 86 countries or overseas territories worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2011/03/01/where-in-world-is-fox.html|title=Where in the World is FOX?|date=March 1, 2011|work=Fox News|access-date=February 2, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; with international broadcasts featuring Fox Extra segments during ad breaks.

The channel was created by Australian-American [[media proprietor|media mogul]] [[Rupert Murdoch]] to appeal to a conservative audience, hiring former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] media consultant and [[CNBC]] executive [[Roger Ailes]] as its founding [[Chief executive officer|CEO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E4DE1F3FF934A35753C1A960958260|title=At the new Fox News Channel, the buzzword is fairness, separating news from bias| work=The New York Times| first=Lawrie| last=Mifflin| date=October 7, 1996| accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twenty-first-fox-ailes-newsmaker-idUSKCN1012RM|title=Divisive Ailes gave conservatives a TV home at Fox News|date=July 21, 2016|publisher=|via=www.reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It launched on October 7, 1996, to 17 million cable subscribers.&lt;ref name=King/&gt; Fox News grew during the late 1990s and 2000s to become the dominant [[United States cable news|subscription news network in the US]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillette, Felix (October 1, 2008).

Fox News has been described as practicing [[Fox News controversies|biased reporting]] in favor of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], the [[George W.

{{Main|History of Fox News}}
[[Image:Roger Ailes, TV Titan 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roger Ailes]] and [[Rupert Murdoch]] established Fox News in 1996.]]
In May 1985, Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch announced he and American [[Business magnate|industrialist]] and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[Marvin Davis]] intended to develop "a network of [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]] as a fourth marketing force" to compete directly with [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] through the purchase of six television stations owned by [[Metromedia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenzner, Robert (May 5, 1985).

Subsequently, and prior to founding FNC, Murdoch had gained experience in the 24-hour news business when [[News Corporation]]'s [[BSkyB]] subsidiary began Europe's first 24-hour news channel ([[Sky News]]) in the United Kingdom in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Saeed (September 24, 2002).

''Chicago Sun-Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; experience gained from Sky News and the turnaround of 20th Century Fox, Murdoch announced on January 31, 1996, that News Corp. would launch a 24-hour news channel on cable and satellite systems in the United States as part of a News Corp. "worldwide platform" for Fox programming: "The appetite for news&amp;nbsp;‚Äì particularly news that explains to people how it affects them&amp;nbsp;‚Äì is expanding enormously".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Scott (January 31, 1996). [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MWSB&amp;p_theme=mwsb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB8296FA53CDCD2&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D "Murdoch taps Ailes for new network; Former CNBC chief set to direct 24-hour news channel, take on CNN"]. Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1996, after former U.S. Republican Party political strategist and NBC executive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E4DE1F3FF934A35753C1A960958260|title=At the new Fox News Channel, the buzzword is fairness, separating news from bias| work=The New York Times|first=Lawrie|last=Mifflin|date=October 7, 1996|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ailes]] left cable television channel [[America's Talking]] (now [[MSNBC]]), Murdoch asked him to start Fox News Channel. Ailes demanded five months of 14-hour workdays and several weeks of rehearsal shows before its launch on October 7, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newscorp.com/management/foxnewschannel.html |title=Fox News Channel |accessdate=April 21, 2008 |date=April 18, 2008 |publisher=News Corporation |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRTzXbU5?url=http://www.newscorp.com/management/foxnewschannel.html |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its debut 17 million households were able to watch FNC;&lt;ref name=King&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox Hunts TV News Niche with Channel Debut Today|work=[[New York Daily News]]|first=Angela G. |last=King |date=October 7, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was absent from the media markets of New York City and Los Angeles. Rolling news coverage during the day consisted of 20-minute single-topic shows such as ''Fox on Crime'' or ''Fox on Politics'', surrounded by news headlines. Interviews featured facts at the bottom of the screen about the topic or the guest. The flagship newscast at the time was ''The Schneider Report'', with [[Mike Schneider (news anchor)|Mike Schneider]]'s fast-paced delivery of the news. During the evening, Fox featured opinion shows: ''The O'Reilly Report'' (later ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''), ''The Crier Report'' (hosted by [[Catherine Crier]]) and ''[[Hannity &amp; Colmes]]''.

From the beginning, FNC has placed heavy emphasis on visual presentation. Graphics were designed to be colorful and gain attention; this helped the viewer to grasp the main points of what was being said, even if they could not hear the host (with on-screen text summarizing the position of the interviewer or speaker, and "bullet points" when a host was delivering commentary). Fox News also created the "Fox News Alert", which interrupted its regular programming when a [[breaking news]] story occurred.
[[Image:Fox News 6th 48 jeh.JPG|thumb|right|Fox News Studios in 2009.]]
To accelerate its adoption by cable providers, Fox News paid systems up to $11 per subscriber to distribute the channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-18396534/bold-grab-subs-murdoch.html |author=Richard Katz |date=May 1996 |title=Bold grab for subs: Murdoch offers $11 to carry Fox News |publisher=Multichannel News |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRU0fPQa?url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-18396534/bold-grab-subs-murdoch.html |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasted with the normal practice, in which cable operators paid stations carriage fees for programming. When [[Time Warner]] bought [[Ted Turner]]'s [[Turner Broadcasting System]], a federal [[antitrust]] [[consent decree]] required Time Warner to carry a second all-news channel in addition to its own [[CNN]] on its [[Time Warner Cable|cable systems]]. Time Warner selected MSNBC as the secondary news channel, not Fox News. Fox News claimed this violated an agreement (to carry Fox News). Citing its agreement to keep its U.S. headquarters and a large studio in New York City, News Corporation enlisted the help of Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]]'s administration to pressure Time Warner Cable (one of the city's two cable providers) to transmit Fox News on a city-owned channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E3DA123FF937A35753C1A960958260|title=Giuliani Pressures Time Warner to Transmit a Fox Channel| work=The New York Times|first=Mark|last=Landler|date=October 4, 1996 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; City officials threatened to take action affecting Time Warner's cable franchises in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E7DB103FF936A35753C1A960958260|title=City Hall Threatens Action if Time Warner Rejects Channel|work=The New York Times|first=Clifford J.|last=Levy |date=October 5, 1996|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], Fox News was the first news organization to run a [[news ticker]] on the bottom of the screen to keep up with the flow of information that day. The ticker has remained, informing viewers about additional news which reporters may not mention on-screen and repeating news mentioned during a broadcast; it has proven popular with viewers.&lt;ref name="The Fox News Ticker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mandatory.com/2012/09/11/11-direct-effects-9-11-had-on-the-sports-and-entertainment-indus/#photo=2|title=11 Direct Effects 9/11 Had on the Sports and Entertainment Industries|last=Dudak|first=Gary|date=September 11, 2012|publisher=Mandatory.com|accessdate=September 13, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920021735/http://www.mandatory.com/2012/09/11/11-direct-effects-9-11-had-on-the-sports-and-entertainment-indus#photo=2|archivedate=September 20, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 11, 2009, in a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article, Fox said its hard-news programming runs from "9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 to 8 p.m. on weekdays" and "[is] objective"; however, it makes no such claims for its other broadcasts, which primarily consist of editorial journalism and commentary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/business/media/12fox.html Stelter, Brian.

{{Main|Fox News Radio}}
With the growth of FNC, the company introduced a radio division, [[Fox News Radio]], in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vu4wDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT57&amp;dq=%22Fox+News+radio%22+2003#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fox%20News%20radio%22%202003|title=Media Ethics: Cases and Moral Reasoning|last=Christians|first=Clifford G.|last2=Fackler|first2=Mark|last3=Richardson|first3=Kathy Brittain|last4=Kreshel|first4=Peggy|last5=Woods|first5=Robert H.|date=October 4, 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134841561|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syndicated radio show|Syndicated]] throughout the United States, the division provides short newscasts and talk radio programs featuring personalities from the television and radio divisions.

In September 2008, FNC joined other channels in introducing a live streaming segment to its website: ''The Strategy Room'', designed to appeal to older viewers. It airs weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and takes the form of an informal discussion, with running commentary on the news. Regular discussion programs include ''Business Hour'', ''News With a View'' and ''God Talk''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/business/media/16fox.html "For Talking Heads, a Spot to Relax and Sip Coffee, on Webcam "] ''The New York Times''.

==Ratings and reception==
In 2003, Fox News saw a large ratings jump during the early stages of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|US invasion of Iraq]]. At the height of the conflict, according to some reports, Fox News had as much as a 300% increase in viewership (averaging 3.3 million viewers daily).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3148015.stm |title=War coverage lifts News Corp |publisher=BBC |accessdate=November 29, 2005 |date=August 13, 2003 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRUCY6gc?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3148015.stm |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Fox News' ratings for its broadcast of the [[2004 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] exceeded those of the three major broadcast networks. During President [[George W. Bush]]'s address, Fox News attracted 7.3 million viewers nationally; NBC, ABC, and CBS had a viewership of 5.9 million, 5.1 million, and 5.0 million respectively.

Between late-2005 and early-2006, Fox News saw a brief decline in ratings. One was in the second quarter of 2006, when it lost viewers for every prime-time program compared with the previous quarter. The audience for the ''[[Special Report with Bret Baier|Special Report with Brit Hume]]'', for example, dropped 19%. Several weeks later, in the wake of the [[2006 North Korean missile test]] and the [[2006 Lebanon War]], Fox saw a surge in viewership and remained the #1-rated cable news channel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080517073747/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/ratings/fncs_2554_prime_downward_spiral_20939.asp FNC's 25‚Äì54 Prime "Downward Spiral"], TV Newser&lt;br /&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100803033420/http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2005/narrative_cabletv_contentanalysis.asp?media=5&amp;cat=2 Cable TV: Content Analysis], The State of the News Media 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Fox produced eight of the top ten most-watched nightly cable news shows, with ''The O'Reilly Factor'' and ''[[Hannity &amp; Colmes]]'' finishing first and second respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070614001942/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/original/ranker_april05.pdf April 2005 Competitive Program Ranker (M-F 6a-11p programs)], TV Newser&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, the [[Pew Research Center]] published a report on the public view of national news organizations. In the report, 72 percent of polled Republican Fox viewers rated the channel as "favorable", while 43 percent of polled Democratic viewers and 55 percent of all polled viewers shared that opinion. However, Fox was given the highest "unfavorable" rating of all national outlets studied (25 percent of all polled viewers). The report went on to say, "partisan differences in views of Fox News have increased substantially since 2007".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Press Accuracy Rating Hits Two-Decade Low |url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1341/press-accuracy-rating-hits-two-decade-low |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRUF5PM6?url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1341/press-accuracy-rating-hits-two-decade-low |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all |access-date=September 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Public Policy Polling poll concluded in 2013 that perceptions of FNC had declined from 2010. 41% of polled voters said they trust it, down from 49% in 2010, while 46% said they distrust it, up from 37% in 2010.

===Demographics===
As indicated by a ''New York Times'' article, based on [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] statistics, Fox appears to have a mostly aged demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/business/its-viewers-are-graying-but-their-passion-pays-for-fox-news.html | work=The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Carter | title=Fox Viewers May Be Graying, but Their Passion Still Pays | date=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, in the 25‚Äì54 age group, Fox News had an average of 557,000 viewers, but dropped to 379,000 in 2013 while increasing its overall audience from 1.89 million in 2010 to 2.02 million in 2013.

==Slogan==
Fox News Channel originally used the slogan "Fair and Balanced", which was coined by network co-founder Roger Ailes while the network was being established. ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the slogan as being a "blunt signal that Fox News planned to counteract what Mr. Ailes and many others viewed as a [[liberal media|liberal bias]] ingrained in television coverage by establishment news networks."&lt;ref name="nyt-fairandbalanced"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/business/media/fox-news-fair-and-balanced.html |title=Fox News Drops 'Fair and Balanced' Motto |work=The New York Times |author=Michael M.

In August 2003, Fox [[Fox v. Franken|sued]] comedian [[Al Franken]] over his use of the slogan as a subtitle for his book, ''[[Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them|Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right]]'', which is critical of Fox News Channel.&lt;ref name="foxsuit"&gt;de Moraes, Lisa (August 12, 2003).

In his decision, Chin ruled the case was "wholly without merit, both factually and legally". He went on to suggest that Fox News' trademark on the phrase "fair and balanced" could be invalid.&lt;ref name="foxloss"&gt;Phil Hirschkorn (August 22, 2003).

''CNN''&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2003, FNC won a legal battle concerning the slogan, when [[AlterNet]] filed a cancellation petition with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) to have FNC's trademark rescinded as inaccurate. AlterNet included [[Robert Greenwald]]'s documentary film ''[[Outfoxed]]'' (2004) as supporting evidence in its case.&lt;ref name="coyle"&gt;Coyle, Jake (July 19, 2004).

In August 2016, Fox News Channel began to quietly phase out the "Fair and Balanced" slogan in favor of "Most Watched, Most Trusted"; when these changes were reported in June 2017 by [[Gabriel Sherman]] (a writer who had written a biography on Ailes), a network executive said the change "has nothing to do with programming or editorial decisions." It was speculated by media outlets that Fox News Channel was wishing to distance itself from Ailes' tenure at the network.&lt;ref name="nyt-fairandbalanced"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40289497 | title=Fox News drops 'fair and balanced' slogan without announcement | work=BBC News | date=June 15, 2017 | accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salon-fairandbalanced"/&gt; In March 2018, the network introduced a new ad campaign, ''Real News.

Fox News provided extensive coverage of the [[2012 Benghazi attack]], which host [[Sean Hannity]] described in December 2012 as "the story that the mainstream media ignores" and "obviously, a cover-up. And we will get to the bottom of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/11/09/why-has-fox-news-abandoned-benghazi/|title=Opinion - Why has Fox News abandoned Benghazi?|last=https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple|website=Washington Post|accessdate=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programming analysis by [[Media Matters]] found that during the twenty months following the Benghazi attacks, FNC ran 1,098 segments on the issue, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2014/09/16/report-foxs-benghazi-obsession-by-the-numbers/200694|title=REPORT: Fox's Benghazi Obsession By The Numbers|date=September 9, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 478 segments involving [[Susan Rice]]'s September 16, 2012 Sunday news show appearances, during which she was falsely accused of lying
* 382 segments on ''Special Report'', the network's flagship news program
* 281 segments alleging a "cover-up" by the Obama administration
* 144 interviews of GOP members of Congress, but only five interviews of Democratic members of Congress and Obama administration officials
* 120 comparisons to Iran-Contra, Watergate, and the actions of the Nixon administration
* 100 segments falsely suggesting the administration issued a "stand-down order" to prevent a rescue operation in Benghazi

Over nearly four years after the Benghazi attack, there were [[Investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack|ten official investigations]], including six by Republican-controlled House committees. None of the investigations found any evidence of scandal, cover-up or lying by Obama administration officials.

On June 29, 2018, Fox News broadcast a segment by news anchor [[Bret Baier]] entitled "Whatever happened to the Benghazi investigation?" which repeated some of the accusations the network had previously made about Susan Rice and [[Hillary Clinton]], but for which the women had been exonerated by the official investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://video.foxnews.com/v/5803740013001/?#sp=show-clips|title=Whatever happened to the Benghazi investigation?|date=June 29, 2018|website=Fox News|accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uranium One===

From 2015 into 2018, Fox News broadcast extensive coverage of an alleged scandal surrounding the sale of [[Uranium One]] to Russian interests, which host Sean Hannity characterized as "one of the biggest scandals in American history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/10/25/hannity-uranium-one-deal-was-biggest-scandal-american-history-nda-lifted-informant|title=Hannity: Uranium One Deal 'One of the Biggest Scandals in American History'|date=October 26, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fox News coverage extended throughout the programming day, with particular emphasis by Hannity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/11/09/study-fox-spent-nearly-12-hours-pushing-uranium-one-pseudoscandal-over-last-three-weeks/218475|title=Study: Fox spent nearly 12 hours pushing the Uranium One pseudoscandal over the last three weeks|date=November 8, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network promoted an ultimately unfounded narrative asserting that, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton personally approved the Uranium One sale in exchange for $145 million in bribes paid to the [[Clinton Foundation]].

In November 2017, Fox News host [[Shepard Smith]] concisely debunked the alleged scandal, infuriating viewers who suggested he should work for CNN or MSNBC.&lt;ref name="WPFoxdebunk" /&gt; Hannity later called Smith "clueless," while Smith stated, "I get it, that some of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining.

During the Republican primaries, Fox News was widely perceived as trying to prevent Trump from clinching the nomination.&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt; However, under Trump's presidency, Fox News remade itself into his image, as nearly no criticism could be heard of Trump on Fox News' prime-time shows.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/09/fox-news-trump-presidency-244712|title=Fox, facing new competitors, clings tighter to Trump|work=POLITICO|access-date=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; Even in Fox News' news reporting, the network dedicated far more coverage to Hillary Clinton-related stories, which critics say was intended to deflect attention from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; Trump provided great access to Fox News during his presidency, giving 19 interviews to the channel while only 6 in total to other news channels by November 2017; ''The New York Times'' described Trump's Fox News interviews as "softball interviews" and some of the interviewers' interview styles as "fawning";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/arts/television/president-trump-finds-his-tv-niche-in-softball-interviews.html|title=President Trump Finds His TV Niche in Softball Interviews|last=Poniewozik|first=James|date=November 10, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 10, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, ''[[The Economist]]'' has described the network's coverage of Trump's presidency as "reliably fawning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/07/30/donald-trumps-attacks-on-the-media-may-have-backfired|title=Donald Trump's attacks on the media may have backfired|work=The Economist|date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2015 to 2017, the Fox News prime-time line-up changed from one that was skeptical and questioning of Trump to a "Trump safe space, with a dose of Bannonist populism once considered on the fringe."&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; The Fox News website has also gotten more extreme in its rhetoric since the election of Donald Trump; according to Columbia's Tow Center for Digital Journalism, the Fox News website has "gone a little Breitbart" over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/23/fox-news-website-breitbart-312326|title=Fox News website beefs up and 'goes a little Breitbart'|work=POLITICO|access-date=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of 2018, Fox News mostly ignored prominent scandals in the Trump administration which received ample coverage in other national media outlets, such as White House Staff Secretary [[Rob Porter]]'s resignation amid domestic abuse allegations, the downgrading of [[Jared Kushner]]'s security clearance and the existence of a [[non-disclosure agreement]] between Trump and the porn star [[Stormy Daniels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/08/media/pro-trump-media-stormy-daniels/index.html|title=Pro-Trump media sweeps Stormy Daniels story under rug|last=Darcy|first=Oliver|work=CNNMoney|access-date=March 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A leaked memo from Fox News vice president [[Bill Sammon]] to news staff at the height of the [[health care reform in the United States]] debate has been cited as an example of the pro-[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] bias of Fox News. His memo asked the staff to "use the term 'government-run health insurance,' or, when brevity is a concern, 'government option,' whenever possible". The memo was sent shortly after Republican pollster [[Frank Luntz]] advised [[Sean Hannity]] on his Fox show, "If you call it a public option, the American people are split. If you call it the government option, the public is overwhelmingly against it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/leaked-fox-news-memo-reveals-news-division-told-to-echo-gop-talking-point-2010-12|title=Leaked Fox News Memo Reveals News Division Told To Echo GOP Talking Point, ''Business Insider'', December 9, 2010|date=December 9, 2010|work=Business Insider|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys suggest Fox News is widely perceived to be ideological.

[[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]], media critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', praised the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential election]] results coverage on Fox News for the network's response to Republican adviser and Fox News contributor [[Karl Rove]] challenging its call that [[Barack Obama]] would win Ohio and the election. Fox's prediction was correct. Carr wrote:

{{quote|text= Over many months, Fox lulled its conservative base with agitprop: that President Obama was a clear failure, that a majority of Americans saw [[Mitt Romney|[Mitt] Romney]] as a good alternative in hard times, and that polls showing otherwise were politically motivated and not to be believed.

Guest [[Corey Lewandowski]] mocked the story of a 10-year-old child with Down's syndrome being separated from her mother; the Fox News host did not address Lewandowski's statement.&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt; Guest [[Ann Coulter]] falsely claimed that the separated children were "child actors"; the Fox News host did not challenge her claim.&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt; In a segment on Trump's alleged use of racial dog whistles, one Fox News contributor told an African-American whom he was debating, "You're out of your cotton-picking mind."&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt;

According to the 2016 book ''Asymmetric Politics'' by political scientists Matt Grossmann and David A. Hopkins, Fox News tends to raise the profile of scandals and controversies involving Democrats that receive scant attention in other media, such as the relationship between Barack Obama and William Ayers ... Hillary Clinton's role in the fatal 2012 attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya; the gun-running scandal known as "Fast and Furious"; the business practices of federal loan guarantee recipient Solyndra; the past activism of Obama White House operative Van Jones; the 2004 attacks on John Kerry by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth; the controversial sermons of Obama's Chicago pastor Jeremiah Wright; the filming of undercover videos of supposed wrongdoing by the liberal activist group ACORN; and even the "war on Christmas" supposedly waged every December by secular, multicultural liberals."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

In October 2018, Fox News ran laudatory coverage of a meeting between Trump-supporting rapper Kanye West and President Trump in the Oval Office. Fox News had previously run negative coverage of rappers and their involvement with Democratic politicians and causes, such as when Fox News ran headlines describing conscious hip-hop artist Common as "vile" and a "cop-killer rapper", and when Fox News ran negative coverage of Kanye West before he became a Trump supporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2018/10/12/fox-swooned-over-kanye-west-white-house-heres-how-it-covered-rappers-visiting-obama/|title=Fox swooned over Kanye West at the White House.

=== False claims about other media ===

==== CNN's Jake Tapper ====
In November 2017, in the immediate aftermath of the [[2017 New York City truck attack]] wherein a terrorist shouted "Allahu Akbar", Fox News distorted a statement by Jake Tapper to make it appear as if he had said "[[Takbir|Allahu Akbar]]" can be used under the most "beautiful circumstances".&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/jake-tapper-fox-news-lying-allahu-akbar-beautiful-2017-11?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Jake Tapper slams Fox News for misrepresenting comments about New York City terror attack|work=Business Insider|access-date=November 2, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox News omitted that Tapper had said the use of "Allahu Akbar" in the terrorist attack was not one of these beautiful circumstances.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; A headline on FoxNews.com was preceded by a tag reading "OUTRAGEOUS".&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; The Fox News Twitter account distorted the statement even more, saying "Jake Tapper Says 'Allahu Akbar' Is 'Beautiful' Right After NYC Terror Attack" in a tweet that was later deleted.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Tapper chastised Fox News for choosing to "deliberately lie" and said "there was a time when one could tell the difference between Fox and the nutjobs at Infowars. It's getting tougher and tougher.

=== Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville ===
Various Fox News hosts and contributors defended Trump's remarks that "many sides" were to blame for violence at a gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/business/media/wow-stunned-tv-hosts-reacted-in-real-time-to-trump.html|title='Wow': Stunned TV Hosts Reacted in Real Time to Trump|last=Grynbaum|first=Michael M.|date=August 15, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 16, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/08/17/in-conservative-media-an-amen-chorus-defends-trump-on-charlottesville/|title=In conservative media, an amen chorus defends Trump's comments on Charlottesville violence|access-date=August 18, 2017|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some criticized Trump.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/08/16/media/fox-charlottesville-prime-time/index.html|title=After Trump's Charlottesville remarks, Fox News focuses on the left and the media|last=Byers|first=Dylan|date=August 16, 2017|website=CNNMoney|access-date=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In a press conference on August 15, Trump used the term "alt-left" to describe counterprotesters at the white supremacist rally, a term which had been used in Fox News' coverage of the white supremacist rally.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Several of Trump's comments at the press conference mirrored those appearing earlier on Fox News.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-charlottesville-press-conference-white-supremacy/|title=Trump Cribbed His Charlottesville Press Conference Straight From Fox News|work=WIRED|access-date=August 16, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dylan Byers]] of CNN, Fox News' coverage on the day of the press conference "was heavy with "[[whataboutism]]". The average Fox viewer was likely left with the impression that the media's criticism of Trump and leftist protestors' toppling of some Confederate statues were far greater threats to America than white supremacism or the president's apparent defense of bigotry."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Byers wrote, "it showed that if Fox News has a line when it comes to Trump's presidency, it was not crossed on Tuesday."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

On September 20, President [[Barack Obama]] appeared on all major news programs except Fox News, a snub partially in response to remarks about him by commentators Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity, and Fox coverage of Obama's health-care proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/business/media/12fox.html|work=The New York Times|title=Fox's Volley With Obama Intensifying|first=Brian|last=Stelter|date=October 12, 2009|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usnews.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/obama/2009/10/23/fox-pushed-team-obama-over-the-brink.html |title=White House: Fox Pushed Team Obama Over the Brink ‚Äì US News and World Report |publisher=Usnews.com |date=October 23, 2009 |accessdate=July 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRUSCZjg?url=http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/obama/2009/10/23/fox-pushed-team-obama-over-the-brink.html |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late September 2009, Obama senior advisor [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]] and Roger Ailes met in secret to attempt to smooth out tensions between the two camps. Two weeks later, chief of staff [[Rahm Emanuel]] referred to FNC as "not a news network" and communications director [[Anita Dunn]] said "Fox News often operates as either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://features.csmonitor.com/politics/2009/10/23/the-fox-news-war-whats-the-upside-for-obama/ |title=The Fox News war: What's the upside for Obama? |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRUTCrgh?url=http://features.csmonitor.com/politics/2009/10/23/the-fox-news-war-whats-the-upside-for-obama/ |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/us/politics/23fox.html|work=The New York Times|title=Behind the War Between White House and Fox|first=Jim|last=Rutenberg|date=October 23, 2009|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama observed, "If media is operating basically as a talk radio format, then that's one thing, and if it's operating as a news outlet, then that's another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/23/eveningnews/main5415921.shtml?tag=stack |title=President Obama's Feud with FOX News ‚Äì CBS Evening News |publisher=CBS News |date=October 23, 2009 |accessdate=July 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRUTlhWd?url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/23/eveningnews/main5415921.shtml?tag=stack |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; White House chief of staff [[Rahm Emanuel]] said it was important "to not have the CNNs and the others in the world basically be led in following Fox".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-rutten24-2009oct24,0,3009088.column |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Obama's misguided Fox hunt |date=October 24, 2009 |accessdate=May 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRUVTHlE?url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-rutten24-2009oct24,0,3009088.column |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days, it was reported that Fox had been excluded from an interview with administration official [[Ken Feinberg]], with bureau chiefs from the White House press pool (ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN) coming to Fox's defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/us/politics/23fox.html|work=The New York Times|title=Behind the War Between White House and Fox|first=Jim|last=Rutenberg|date=October 23, 2009|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bureau chief said, "If any member had been excluded it would have been the same thing, it has nothing to do with Fox or the White House or the substance of the issues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Christina Bellantoni |date=October 23, 2009 |url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/10/wh-were-happy-to-exclude-fox-but-didnt-yesterday-with-feinberg-interview.php |title=WH: We're Happy To Exclude Fox, But Didn't Yesterday With Feinberg Interview &amp;#124; TPMDC |publisher=Tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com |accessdate=July 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRUXNrxX?url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/10/wh-were-happy-to-exclude-fox-but-didnt-yesterday-with-feinberg-interview.php |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the story broke, the White House admitted to a low-level mistake, saying Fox had not made a specific request to interview Feinberg. Fox White House correspondent Major Garrett said he had not made a specific request, but had a "standing request from me as senior White House correspondent on Fox to interview any newsmaker at the Treasury at any given time news is being made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Krakauer |url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/finally-resolved-major-garrett-reveals-his-side-of-pay-czar-gate/ |title=Finally Resolved?

On November 8, 2009, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported an unnamed Democratic consultant was warned by the White House not to appear on Fox News again. According to the article, Anita Dunn claimed in an e-mail to have checked with colleagues who "deal with TV issues" who denied telling anyone to avoid Fox. [[Patrick Caddell]], a Fox News contributor and former pollster for President [[Jimmy Carter]], said he had spoken with other Democratic consultants who had received similar warnings from the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-obama-fox8-2009nov08,0,507227.story?test=latestnews |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Democratic consultant says he got a warning from White House after appearing on Fox News |first=Peter |last=Nicholas |date=November 8, 2009 |accessdate=May 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRUZStRy?url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-obama-fox8-2009nov08,0,507227.story?test=latestnews |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journalistic ethical standards ===
Fox News attracted controversy in April 2018 when it was revealed primetime host Sean Hannity had defended [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)|Michael Cohen]] on air without disclosing that Cohen was Hannity's lawyer.&lt;ref name="No Disclosure?

==International transmission==
[[File:Fox News World Providers Map.svg|thumb|Countries where Fox News is provided|alt=World map, with countries carrying terrestrial FNC in red and satellite providers in orange]]
The Fox News Channel feed is available internationally via a number of providers, while ''Fox Extra'' segments provide alternate programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,77537,00.html|title=Fox Around the World|work=Fox News.com|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=March 6, 2012|access-date=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Fox Extra}}''Fox Extra''===
Initially, U.S. advertisements were replaced on FNC with viewer e-mail and profiles of FNC anchors set to music. In 2002, these were replaced with international weather forecasts. In 2006, the weather forecasts were replaced with ''Fox Extra'' (originally ''Fox News Extra'', prior to the international launch of [[Fox Business]]) segments, narrated reports from Fox on a variety of topics. These reports generally concern lighter issues unrelated to current news events, and the segments are repeated. FNC also shows international weather forecasts when ''Fox Extra'' segments run short. In the United Kingdom, after a period when local commercials were inserted into breaks, ''Fox Extra'' now fills most breaks.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Australia===
In Australia, FNC is broadcast on the dominant pay television provider [[Foxtel]], which is 50% owned by [[News Corp Australia]], the Australian arm of [[News Corp]] and the sister company of [[21st Century Fox]] which owns FNC. Local cable news channel [[Sky News Australia]] is wholly owned by News Corp Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/news-corp-buys-sky-news-in-australia-and-new-zealand-from-seven-and-nine-20161201-gt1kuz.html|title= News Corp buys Sky News in Australia and New Zealand from Seven and Nine |work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=December 1, 2016|accessdate=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is therefore FNC's de facto sister channel, although has formal partnerships with FNC competitor [[CNN]] as well as both [[ABC News]] and [[CBS News]].&lt;ref name=CMHacq&gt;{{Cite news | title = News Limited seals pay TV deal after Federal Court approves CMH takeover | work = [[The Australian]] | accessdate = November 4, 2012 | date = November 2, 2012 | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/news-limited-seals-pay-tv-deal-after-federal-court-approved-cmh-acqusition/story-e6frg6n6-1226509333236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
Since 2002, FNC has been broadcast to Brazil; however, commercials are replaced with ''Fox Extra''. It is available in packages of [[Vivo TV]].

===Canada===
Fox had initially planned to launch a joint venture with [[Canwest]]'s  [[Global Television Network]], tentatively named Fox News Canada, which would have featured a mixture of U.S. and [[Canadian content|Canadian]] news programming. As a result, the [[CRTC]] denied a 2003 application requesting permission for Fox News Channel to be [[List of foreign television channels available in Canada|carried in Canada]]. However, in March 2004, a Fox executive said the venture had been shelved; in November of that year, the CRTC authorized Fox News Channel to be distributed by Canadian cable and satellite providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/crtc-approves-fox-news-for-canada-1.492643 |title=CRTC approves Fox News for Canada |work=CBC News |date=November 18, 2004 |accessdate=August 27, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRUZpdxg?url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/11/18/fox_crtc041118.html |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
FNC was also carried in the [[Television in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] by [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]], which was 40-percent owned by 21st Century Fox at the time, and operates its own domestic news channel [[Sky News]]. On August 29, 2017, Sky dropped Fox News; the broadcaster said its carriage was not "commercially viable" due to average viewership of fewer than 2,000 viewers per day. The company said the decision was unrelated to 21st Century Fox's proposed acquisition of the remainder of [[Sky plc]] (which ultimately led to a bidding war that resulted in its acquisition by [[Comcast]] instead).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/26/rupert-murdochs-sky-reign-to-end-as-fox-sells-all-shares-to-comcast|title=Rupert Murdoch's Sky reign to end as Fox sells all shares to Comcast|last=Waterson|first=Jim|date=26 September 2018|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The potential co-ownership had prompted concerns from critics of the deal, who felt Sky News could undergo a shift to an opinionated format with a right-wing viewpoint, similar to Fox News; the channel has violated the [[Ofcom]] codes a number of times, including broadcasting analysis of the [[Brexit]] vote while polls were still open (a violation of British election laws; the channel was blocked while polls were open during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]] to comply with these rules), and various violations of a requirement for all news programming to show due impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/06/fox-news-shows-broke-uk-tv-impartiality-rules-ofcom-finds|title=Fox News shows broke UK TV impartiality rules, Ofcom finds|last=editor|first=Graham Ruddick Media|date=November 6, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=November 7, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/29/sky-to-stop-broadcasting-rightwing-us-channel-fox-news-in-uk|title=Sky stops broadcasting rightwing US channel Fox News in UK|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=August 29, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=August 29, 2017|last2=Ruddick|first2=Graham|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fox-news-stops-airing-uk-a-look-at-ofcom-rulings-1033789|title=Fox News Stops Airing in U.K.: A Look at Ofcom Rulings Against It|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=August 30, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41087659|title=Sky stops broadcasting Fox News in UK|date=August 29, 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=August 29, 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
